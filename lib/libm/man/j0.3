.Sh DESCRIPTION
The functions
.Fn j0 , 
.Fn j0f ,
.Fn j1
and
.Fn j1f
compute the
.Em Bessel function of the first kind of the order
0 and the
.Em order
1, respectively,
for the
real value
.Fa x ;
the functions
.Fn jn
and
.Fn jnf
compute the
.Em Bessel function of the first kind of the integer order
.Fa n
for the real value
.Fa x .
.Pp
The functions
.Fn y0 ,
.Fn y0f ,
.Fn y1
and
.Fn y1f
compute the linearly independent
.Em Bessel function of the second kind of the order
0 and the
.Em order
1, respectively,
for the
positive
.Em integer
value
.Fa x
(expressed as a double);
the functions
.Fn yn
and
.Fn ynf
compute the
.Em Bessel function of the second kind for the integer order
.Fa n
for the positive 
.Em integer
value
.Fa x
(expressed as a double).
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If these functions are successful,
the computed value is returned. On the
.Tn VAX
and
.Tn Tahoe
architectures,
a negative
.Fa x
value
results in an error; the global
variable
.Va errno
is set to
.Er EDOM
and a reserve operand fault is generated.
