/*
 * We define the structure for the TCB, plus three macros:
 *	TCB_THREAD()
 *		Expands to a pointer-to-pthread rvalue that points
 *		to this thread's struct pthread
 *	TCB_ERRNOPTR()
 *		Expands to a pointer-to-int lvalue that points to
 *		this thread's errno
 *	TCB_INIT(tcb, thread, errnoptr)
 *		Expands to a code to initialize the TCB pointed to by
 *		its first argument
 *
 * <machine/tcb.h> must define the TLS_VARIANT macro.  If it defines
 * that to 1, then it must also defined the macro
 *	THREAD_ERRNOPTR_OFFSET
 *		Byte offset in struct pthread of the pointer to the
 *		thread's errno
 *
 * By default, we get and set the TCB pointer for a thread using the
 * __get_tcb() and __set_tcb() syscalls.  If there's a faster way to do
 * either of those, <machine/tcb.h> should define the macros
 *	TCB_SET(tcb)
 *		Set the TCB pointer for this thread
 *	TCB_GET()
 *		Return the TCB pointer for this thread
 * If it defines TCB_GET, then it must also define:
 *	TCB_GET_MEMBER(member)
 *		Return the pointer in the 'member' slot in the TCB
