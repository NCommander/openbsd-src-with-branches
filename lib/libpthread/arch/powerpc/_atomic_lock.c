	 *   the same address with the lwarx in one instrution
	 *   and the stwcx in another process, the current powerpc
	 *   kernel uses a stwcx instruction without the corresponding
	 *   lwarx which causes any reservation of a process
	 *   to be removed.  if a context switch occurs
	 *   between the two accesses the store will not occur
	 *   and the condition code will cause it to loop. If on
	 *   a dual processor machine, the reserve will cause
	 *   appropriate bus cycle accesses to notify other
	 *   processors.
