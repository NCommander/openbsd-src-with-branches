 * fwalk now can only be used for flushing the buffers.
 * This is all it was originally used for.
 * The function has also become much more complicated.
 * The first time through we flush everything we can.
 * If this fails to flush everything because we couldn't get a lock
 * we wait on the locksfor the second pass. Why this works ...
 * 
 * This function must allow for multiple threads to flush everything.
 * This function cannot flush buffers locked by another thread.
 * So we flush everything we can the first pass. This includes all
 * buffers locked by this thread, and wait on buffers that are locked.
 * Eventually other threads willl unlock there buffers or flush them themselves
 * at which point this thread will notice that it's empty or be able to
 * flush the buffer. This is fine so long as no other thread tries to flush
 * all buffers. Here is the possible deadlock condition, but since this thread
 * has flushed all buffers it can, there are NO buffers locked by this thread
 * that need flushing so any other thread flushing won't block waiting on this
 * thread thereby eliminating the deadlock condition.
