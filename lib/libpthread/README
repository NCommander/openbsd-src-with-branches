This pthread package is/will be based on the POSIX1003.1c Draft 10 pthread
standard, and Frank Muellers paper on signal handeling presented at the 
Winter 93 USENIX conference.

It is currently being designed and written by me, Chris Provenzano.
All bug, comments, and questions can be sent me at proven@mit.edu,
or pthreads@mit.edu.

PLEASE, don't send questions, bugs or patches to any of the *BSD*, Linux
or GNU mailing lists.

Thanks goes to Ken Raeburn for his help on the Sparc port, the configurator, 
and his many suggestions, Greg Hudson for the thread safe net routines and
all the testing he's done.

More thanks to Mark Eichin and all the others for the testing they have done.

PORTING
One of the goals of this user space implementation of pthreads is that it
be portable. I have minimized the ammount of assembler code necessary,
but some is.

If you want to port it to another platform here are a few basic hints.

You will need to create a machdep.h, machdep.c and syscall.S for the
new architecture. The first two are necessary to get the context switch 
section of the pthread package running, the third is for all the syscalls.

INCLUDE FILES AND PORTING
In addition to the above three files you need to create a slew of .h files. 
Take a look at an existing port to determine what is in each, and then
take a look at your system header files to determine what to put in them.
