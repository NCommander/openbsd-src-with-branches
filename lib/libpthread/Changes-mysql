- socket() didn't return NOTOK (-1) on error.
- bind() didn't set error code on failure

93.03.27
- Added patch by D. Richard Hipp <drh@vnet.net> to make strtod and
  printf (of floats/doubles) thread safe. Patch provided by mevans@cti-ltd.com
- Added patch I got from lucid@secret.org to fix lock in fork().

93.03.26
- Fixed some include files for BSD 2.0.
- Changed the prototype of ioctl() for BSD.

93.03.22
- Change sys/cdefs.h to get it through Sun cc.
- Added patches by Mark Evans
  1. Crashes and hangs.
  2. Missing functionality (namely flock())
  3. Use of POSIX reentrant safe routines.

93.03.21
- Add patches by Larry V. Streepy to fix pthread_cancel.
  Fixed bug in Streepy's patch that checked return values of read,write..
  in fd.c (Already done in fd_sys.c)

1. Added a declaration of &#34;signal&#34; to include/signal.h
2. Modified PANIC macro to operate like assert and call a new function
   panic_kernel.  Added new file pthreads/panic.c.
3. Added support for fstatfs syscall for linux (mod to
   syscall-i386-linux-1.0.S).
4. Added missing function declarations to machdep/linux-1.0/socket.h:
   getsockopt
   setsockopt
   getsockname
   getpeername
   send
   recv
   sendto
   recvfrom
   sendmsg
   recvmsg
   shutdown
5. Added ifdef to avoid type conflict in machdep/linux-1.0/timers.h
6. Fix bug in getprotoent (bogus semi-colon after if stmt).
7. Change function name in proto_internal.c from _proto_init to 
   _proto_buf.
8. Fix bug in res_internal.c where buffer pointer was improperly 
   maintained.
9. Fix return value handling for POSIX function implementations.
10. Fix bug in select handling where a thread could be incorrectly 
    resumed with no sockets ready.  Also added proper handling of
    selecting for exceptions (this was not implemented at all).
11. Added deadlock detection to pthread_join (it can now return an
    EDEADLK error).
12. Added support for pthread_cancel, changes to lots of files for this.
13. Add new function __pthread_is_valid that searches the pthread list
    for a specified pthread_t value.

  check the patches directory for more info.

  (Required by Posix)

  functions:  pthread_sigmask, sigwait and sigsetwait 
- Added shutdown() and getpeername() prototypes to 'machdep/sunos-5.3/socket.h'

  interrupts a system call.
- pthread_kill can now interrupt the following system calls:
  select(), read(), write(), send(), sendto(), sendmsg(), recv_timedwait(),
  recvfrom_timedwait(), readev(), writeev() and some socket functions.
- Fixed bug in pthread_kill() which count up 'sigcount' wrongly.
  Two pthread_kill() in a row bugged the thread.
- Merged fd_kern_wait and fd_kern_poll to 1 function and removed a
  a bug when polling select.
