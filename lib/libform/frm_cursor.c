|   Facility      :  libnform  
|   Function      :  int pos_form_cursor(FORM * form)
|   
|   Description   :  Moves the form window cursor to the location required
|                    by the form driver to resume form processing. This may
|                    be needed after the application calls a curses library
|                    I/O routine that modifies the cursor position.
|
|   Return Values :  E_OK                      - Success
|                    E_SYSTEM_ERROR            - System error.
|                    E_BAD_ARGUMENT            - Invalid form pointer
|                    E_NOT_POSTED              - Form is not posted
