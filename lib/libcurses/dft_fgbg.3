.SH NAME
\fBdft_fgbg\fR \- use terminal's default colors
..
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fP

\fBint use_default_colors(void);\fP
..
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is an extension to the curses library.
It is used with terminals that support ISO 6429 color, or equivalent.
These terminals allow the application to reset color to an unspecified
default value (e.g., with SGR 39 or SGR 49).
Because they are designed to support this, their design usually includes
features to change the default foreground or background colors so that
they do not match the assumption in XSI curses of white on black.
.PP
Applications that paint a colored background over the whole screen
are not adversely impacted by this type of terminal design.
However, there are applications that are designed to work with
the default background.
..
.SH RETURN VALUE
The function returns the integer \fBERR\fP upon failure and \fBOK\fP on success.
It will fail if either the terminal does not support
the \fIorig_pair\fP or \fIorig_colors\fP capability.
If the \fIinitialize_pair\fP capability is found, this causes an
error as well.
..
.SH NOTES
Associated with this extension, the \fBinit_pair\fR(3) function accepts
negative arguments to specify default foreground or background
colors.
..
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines are specific to ncurses.  They were not supported on
Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended that
any code depending on them be conditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.
..
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurs_color\fR(3),
\fBded\fP(1).
