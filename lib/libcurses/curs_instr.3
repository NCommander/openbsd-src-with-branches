\fBmvinstr\fR, \fBmvinnstr\fR, \fBmvwinstr\fR, \fBmvwinnstr\fR - get a string

.SH DESCRIPTION
These routines return a string of characters in \fIstr\fR, extracted starting
at the current cursor position in the named window and ending at the right
margin of the window.  Attributes are stripped from the characters.  The four
functions with \fIn\fR as the last argument return a leading substring at most
\fIn\fR characters long (exclusive of the trailing NUL).
.SH RETURN VALUE
All routines that return an integer return \fBERR\fR upon failure and OK (SVr4
specifies only "an integer value other than \fBERR\fR") upon successful
completion, unless otherwise noted in the preceding routine descriptions.
.SH NOTES
Note that all routines except \fBwinnstr\fR may be macros.  SVr4 does not
document whether a length limit includes or excludes the trailing NUL, and
does not document the meaning of the return values.
.SH PORTABILITY
These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.  The
standard specifies that they always return \fBOK\fR on success.  The XSI Curses
error conditions \fBEILSEQ\fR and \fBEILOVERFLOW\fR associated with
extebded-level conformance are not yet detected (this implementation does not
yet support XPG4 multibyte characters).
