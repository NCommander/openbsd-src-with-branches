.SH DESCRIPTION
The slk* functions manipulate the set of soft function-key labels that exist on
many terminals.  For those terminals that do not have soft labels,
\fBcurses\fR takes over the bottom line of \fBstdscr\fR, reducing the size of
\fBstdscr\fR and the variable \fBLINES\fR.  \fBcurses\fR standardizes on eight
labels of up to eight characters each.

The \fBslk_init\fR routine must be called before \fBinitscr\fR or \fBnewterm\fR
is called.  If \fBinitscr\fR eventually uses a line from \fBstdscr\fR to
emulate the soft labels, then \fIfmt\fR determines how the labels are arranged
on the screen.  Setting \fIfmt\fR to \fB0\fR indicates a 3-2-3 arrangement of
the labels; \fB1\fR indicates a 4-4 arrangement.

The \fBslk_set\fR routine requires \fIlabnum\fR to be a label number,
from \fB1\fR to \fB8\fR; \fIlabel\fR must be the string to be put on the
label, up to eight characters in length.  A null string or a null
pointer sets up a blank label.  \fIfmt\fR is either \fB0\fR, \fB1\fR,
or \fB2\fR, indicating whether the label is to be left-justified,
centered, or right-justified, respectively, within the label.

The \fBslk_refresh\fR and \fBslk_noutrefresh\fR routines correspond to
the \fBwrefresh\fR and \fBwnoutrefresh\fR routines.

The \fBslk_label\fR routine returns the current label for label number
\fIlabnum\fR, with leading and trailing blanks stripped.

The \fBslk_clear\fR routine clears the soft labels from the screen.

The \fBslk_restore\fR routine, restores the soft labels to the screen
after a \fBslk_clear\fR has been performed.

The \fBslk_touch\fR routine forces all the soft labels to be output
the next time a \fBslk_noutrefresh\fR is performed.

The \fBslk_attron\fR, \fBslk_attrset\fR and \fBslk_attroff\fR routines
correspond to \fBattron\fR, \fBattrset\fR, and \fBattroff\fR.  They
have an effect only if soft labels are simulated on the bottom line of
the screen.  The default highlight for soft keys is A_STANDOUT (as in 
System V curses, which does not document this fact).
.SH RETURN VALUE
These routines return \fBERR\fR upon failure and OK (SVr4 specifies only "an
integer value other than \fBERR\fR") upon successful completion.

\fBslk_label\fR returns \fBNULL\fR on error.
.SH NOTES
Most applications would use \fBslk_noutrefresh\fR because a
\fBwrefresh\fR is likely to follow soon.
.SH PORTABILITY
The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4, describes these functions.  It changes the
argument type of the attribute-manipulation functions \fBslk_attron\fR,
\fBslk_attroff\fR, \fBslk_attrset\fR to be \fBattr_t\fR, and adds \fBconst\fR
qualifiers.
