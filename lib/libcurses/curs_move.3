.TH curs_move 3X ""
.SH NAME
\fBmove\fR, \fBwmove\fR - move \fBcurses\fR window cursor
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fR

\fBint move(int y, int x);\fR
.br
\fBint wmove(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
These routines move the cursor associated with the window to line \fIy\fR and
column \fIx\fR.  This routine does not move the physical cursor of the terminal
until \fBrefresh\fR is called.  The position specified is relative to the upper
left-hand corner of the window, which is (0,0).
.SH RETURN VALUE
These routines return \fBERR\fR upon failure and OK (SVr4
specifies only "an integer value other than \fBERR\fR") upon successful
completion.
.SH NOTES
Note that \fBmove\fR may be a macro.
.SH PORTABILITY
These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.  The
standard specifies that if (y,x) is within a multi-column character, the cursor
is moved to the first column of that character; however, this implementation
does not yet support the extended-level XSI multi-byte characters.
