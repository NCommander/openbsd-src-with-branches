.SH NAME
\fBkeyok\fP \- enable or disable a keycode
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fP

\fBint keyok(int keycode, bool enable);\fP
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is an extension to the curses library.
It permits an application to disable specific keycodes, rather than
use the \fIkeypad\fP function to disable all keycodes.
Keys that have been disabled can be reenabled.
.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The keycode must be greater than zero, else ERR is returned.
If it does not correspond to a defined key, then ERR is returned.
If the \fIenable\fP parameter is true, then the key must have been disabled,
and vice versa.
Otherwise, the function returns OK.
.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines are specific to ncurses.  They were not supported on
Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended that
any code depending on them be conditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.
