\fBbkgdset\fR, \fBwbkgdset\fR, \fBbkgd\fR,
\fBwbkgd\fR - \fBcurses\fR window background manipulation routines
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fR

\fBvoid bkgdset(const chtype ch);\fR

\fBvoid wbkgdset(WINDOW *win, const chtype ch);\fR
.br
\fBint bkgd(const chtype ch);\fR

\fBint wbkgd(WINDOW *win, const chtype ch);\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBbkgdset\fR and \fBwbkgdset\fR routines manipulate the
background of the named window.  Background is a \fBchtype\fR
consisting of any combination of attributes and a character.  The
attribute part of the background is combined (ORed) with all non-blank
characters that are written into the window with \fBwaddch\fR.  Both
the character and attribute parts of the background are combined with
the blank characters.  The background becomes a property of the
character and moves with the character through any scrolling and
insert/delete line/character operations.  To the extent possible on a
particular terminal, the attribute part of the background is displayed
as the graphic rendition of the character put on the screen.

The \fBbkgd\fR and \fBwbkgd\fR routines combine the new background
with every position in the window.  Background is any combination of
attributes and a character.  Only the attribute part is used to set
the background of non-blank characters, while both character and
attributes are used for blank positions.  To the extent possible on a
particular terminal, the attribute part of the background is displayed
as the graphic rendition of the character put on the screen.

The \fBwgetbkgd\fR function returns the given window's current background
character/attribute pair.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The routines \fBbkgd\fR and \fBwbkgd\fR return the integer \fBOK\fR.
The SVr4.0 manual says "or a non-negative integer if \fBimmedok\fR is set",
but this appears to be an error.
.SH NOTES
Note that \fBbkgdset\fR and \fBbkgd\fR may be macros.
.SH PORTABILITY
These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.  The draft
does not include \fBconst\fR qualifiers on the arguments.  The standard
specifies that \fBbkgd\fR and \fBwbkgd\fR return \fBERR\fR, on failure. but
gives no failure conditions.  The draft describes the new function
\fBwgetbkgd\fR, which is not in SVr4.
