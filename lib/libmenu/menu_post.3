.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBpost_menu\fR displays a menu to its associated subwindow.  To
trigger physical display of the subwindow, use \fBrefresh\fR or some equivalent
\fBcurses\fR routine (the implicit \fBdoupdate\fR triggered by an \fBcurses\fR
input request will do). \fBpost_menu\fR resets the selection status of all items.

The function \fBunpost_menu\fR erases menu from its associated subwindow.
