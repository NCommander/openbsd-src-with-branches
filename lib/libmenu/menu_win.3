.SH NAME
\fBmenu_win\fR - make and break menu window and subwindow associations
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <menu.h>\fR
.br
int set_menu_window(MENU *menu, WINDOW *win);
.br
WINDOW *menu_window(MENU *menu);
.br
int set_menu_sub(MENU *menu, WINDOW *sub);
.br
WINDOW *menu_sub(MENU *menu);
.br
int scale_window(MENU *menu, int *rows, int *columns);

.SH DESCRIPTION
Every menu has an associated pair of \fBcurses\fR windows.  The menu window
displays any title and border associated with the window; the menu subwindow
displays the items of the menu that are currently available for selection.

The first four functions get and set those windows.  It is not necessary to set
either window; by default, the driver code uses \fBstdscr\fR for both.

In the \fBset_\fR functions, window argument of \fBNULL\fR is treated as tbough
it were \fBstsdcr\fR.  A menu argument of \fBNULL\fR is treated as a request
to change the system default menu window or subwindow.

The function \fBscale_window\fR returns the minimum size required for the
subwindow of \fImenu\fR. 
.SH RETURN VALUE
Routines that return pointers return \fBNULL\fR on error.  Routines that return
an integer return one of the following error codes:
.TP 5
\fBE_OK\fR
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
\fBE_SYSTEM_ERROR\fR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fR).
.TP 5
\fBE_BAD_ARGUMENT\fR
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.TP 5
\fBE_POSTED\fR
The menu has already been posted.
.TP 5
\fBE_NOT_CONNECTED\fR
No items are connected to the menu.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3X), \fBmenu\fR(3X).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<menu.h>\fR automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V menu library.  They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.
