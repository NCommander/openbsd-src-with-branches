.SH NAME
\fBmenu_spacing\fR - Control spacing between menu items.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <menu.h>\fR
.br
int set_menu_spacing(MENU *menu,
                     int spc_description
                     int spc_rows,
                     int spc_columns);
.br
int menu_spacing(const MENU *menu,
                 int* spc_description
                 int* spc_rows,
                 int* spc_columns);
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBset_menu_spacing\fR sets the spacing informations for the menu.
\fBspc_description\fR controls the number of spaces between an item name and an item
description. It must not be larger than \fBTABSIZE\fR. The menu system puts in the
middle of this spacing area the pad character. The remaining parts are filled with
spaces.
\fBspc_rows\fR controls the number of rows that are used for an item. It must not be
larger than 3. The menu system inserts then blank lines between item rows, these lines
will contain the pad character in the appropriate positions.
\fBspc_columns\fR controls the number of blanks between columns of items. It must not
be larger than TABSIZE.
A value of 0 for all the spacing values resets them to the default, which is 1 for all
of them.
.br
The function \fBmenu_spacing\fR passes back the spacing info for the menu. If a
pointer is NULL, this specific info is simply not returned.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Both routines return \fBE_OK\fR on success. \fBset_menu_spacing\fR may return
\fBE_POSTED\fR if the menu is posted, or \fBE_BAD_ARGUMENT\fR if one of the
spacing values is out of range.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3X), \fBmenu\fR(3X).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<menu.h>\fR automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines are specific to ncurses.  They were not supported on
Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended that
any code depending on them be conditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.
