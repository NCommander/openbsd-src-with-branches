v0.2 Sun Jun 23 02:28:42 PDT 1996

- Add support for HP-UX. Resulted from code contributed by Tom Murray
  (tmurray@hpindck.cup.hp.com) and Philippe-Andri Prindeville
  (philipp@res.enst.fr)

- Update INSTALL with a reminder to install include files. Thanks to
  Mark Andrews (mandrews@aw.sgi.com)

- Fix bpf compiler alignment bug on the alpha.

- Use autoconf to detect architectures that can't handle misaligned
  accesses.

- Added loopback support for snoop. Resulted from report Steve
  Alexander (sca@engr.sgi.com)

v0.1 Fri Apr 28 18:11:03 PDT 1995

- Fixed compiler and optimizer bugs.  The BPF filter engine uses unsigned
  comparison operators, while the code generator and optimizer assumed
  signed semantics in several places.  Thanks to Charlie Slater
  (cslater@imatek.com) for pointing this out.

- Removed FDDI ifdef's, they aren't really needed. Resulted from report
  by Gary Veum (veum@boa.gsfc.nasa.gov).

- Add pcap-null.c which allows offline use of libpcap on systems that
  don't support live package capture. This feature resulting from a
  request from Jan van Oorschot (j.p.m.voorschot@et.tudelft.nl).

- Make bpf_compile() reentrant. Fix thanks to Pascal Hennequin
  (Pascal.Hennequin@hugo.int-evry.fr).

- Port to GNU autoconf.

- Fix pcap-dlpi.c to work with isdn. Resulted from report by Flemming
  Johansen (fsj@csd.cri.dk).

- Handle multi-digit interface unit numbers (aka ppa's) under dlpi.
  Resulted from report by Daniel Ehrlich (ehrlich@cse.psu.edu).

- Fix pcap-dlpi.c to work in non-promiscuous mode. Resulted from report
  by Jeff Murphy (jcmurphy@acsu.buffalo.edu).

- Add support for "long jumps". Thanks to Jeffrey Mogul
  (mogul@pa.dec.com).

- Fix minor problems when compiling with BDEBUG as noticed by Scott
  Bertilson (scott@unet.umn.edu).

- Declare sys_errlist "const char *const" to avoid problems under
  FreeBSD. Resulted from report by jher@eden.com.

v0.0.6 Fri Apr 28 04:07:13 PDT 1995

- Add missing variable declaration missing from 0.0.6

v0.0.5 Fri Apr 28 00:22:21 PDT 1995

- Workaround for problems when pcap_read() returns 0 due to the timeout
  expiring.

v0.0.4 Thu Apr 20 20:41:48 PDT 1995

- Change configuration to not use gcc v2 flags with gcc v1.

- Fixed a bug in pcap_next(); if pcap_dispatch() returns 0, pcap_next()
  should also return 0. Thanks to Richard Stevens (rstevens@noao.edu).

- Fixed configure to test for snoop before dlpi to avoid problems under
  IRIX 5. Thanks to J. Eric Townsend (jet@abulafia.genmagic.com).

- Hack around deficiency in Ultrix's make.

- Fix two bugs related to the Solaris pre-5.3.2 bufmod bug; handle
  savefiles that have more than snapshot bytes of data in them (so we
  can read old savefiles) and avoid writing such files.

- Added checkioctl which is used with gcc to check that the
  "fixincludes" script has been run.

v0.0.3 Tue Oct 18 18:13:46 PDT 1994

- Fixed configure to test for snoop before dlpi to avoid problems under
  IRIX 5. Thanks to J. Eric Townsend (jet@abulafia.genmagic.com).

v0.0.2 Wed Oct 12 20:56:37 PDT 1994

- Implement timeout in the dlpi pcap_open_live(). Thanks to Richard
  Stevens.

- Determine pcap link type from dlpi media type. Resulted from report
  by Mahesh Jethanandani (mahesh@npix.com).

v0.0.1 Fri Jun 24 14:50:57 PDT 1994

- Fixed bug in nit_setflags() in pcap-snit.c. The streams ioctl timeout
  wasn't being initialized sometimes resulting in an "NIOCSFLAGS:
  Invalid argument" error under OSF/1. Reported by Matt Day
  (mday@artisoft.com) and Danny Mitzel (dmitzel@whitney.hitc.com).

- Turn on FDDI support by default.

v0.0 Mon Jun 20 19:20:16 PDT 1994

- Initial release.

- Fixed bug with greater/less keywords, reported by Mark Andrews
  (mandrews@alias.com).

- Fix bug where '|' was defined as BPF_AND instead of BPF_OR, reported
  by Elan Amir (elan@leeb.cs.berkeley.edu).

- Machines with little-endian byte ordering are supported thanks to
  Jeff Mogul.

- Add hack for version 2.3 savefiles which don't have caplen and len
  swapped thanks to Vern Paxson.

- Added "&&" and "||" aliases for "and" and "or" thanks to Vern Paxson.

- Added length, inbound and outbound keywords.
