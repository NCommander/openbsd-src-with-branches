This package can be compiled to use the RSAref library.
This library is not allowed outside of the USA but inside the USA it is
claimed by RSA to be the only RSA public key library that can be used
besides BSAFE..

There are 2 files, rsaref/rsaref.c and rsaref/rsaref.h that contain the glue
code to use RSAref.  These files were written by looking at the PGP
source code and seeing which routines it used to access RSAref.
I have also been sent by some-one a copy of the RSAref header file that
contains the library error codes.

[ Jun 1996 update - I have recently gotten hold of RSAref 2.0 from
  South Africa and have been doing some performace tests. ]
	
They have now been tested against the recently announced RSAEURO
library.

There are 2 ways to use SSLeay and RSAref.  First, to build so that
the programs must be linked with RSAref, add '-DRSAref' to CFLAG in the top
level makefile and -lrsaref (or where ever you are keeping RSAref) to
EX_LIBS.

To build a makefile via util/mk1mf.pl to do this, use the 'rsaref' option.

The second method is to build as per normal and link applications with
the RSAglue library.  The correct library order would be
cc -o cmd cmd.o -lssl -lRSAglue -lcrypto -lrsaref -ldes
The RSAglue library is built in the rsa directory and is NOT
automatically installed.

Be warned that the RSAEURO library, that is claimed to be compatible
with RSAref contains a different value for the maximum number of bits
supported.  This changes structure sizes and so if you are using
RSAEURO, change the value of RSAref_MAX_BITS in rsa/rsaref.h
