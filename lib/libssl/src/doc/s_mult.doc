s_mult is a test program I hacked up on a Sunday for testing non-blocking
IO.  It has a select loop at it's centre that handles multiple readers
and writers.

Try the following command
ssleay s_mult -echo -nbio -ssl -v
echo - sends any sent text back to the sender
nbio - turns on non-blocking IO
ssl  - accept SSL connections, default is normal text
v    - print lots
	type Q<cr> to quit

In another window, run the following
ssleay s_client -pause </etc/termcap

The pause option puts in a 1 second pause in each read(2)/write(2) call
so the other end will have read()s fail.
