SSLeay 0.6.6 13-Jan-1997

The main additions are

- assember for x86 DES improvments.
  From 191,000 per second on a pentium 100, I now get 281,000.  The inner
  loop and the IP/FP modifications are from
  Svend Olaf Mikkelsen <svolaf@inet.uni-c.dk>.  Many thanks for his
  contribution.
- The 'DES macros' introduced in 0.6.5 now have 3 types.
  DES_PTR1, DES_PTR2 and 'normal'.  As per before, des_opts reports which
  is best and there is a summery of mine in crypto/des/options.txt
- A few bug fixes.
- Added blowfish.  It is not used by SSL but all the other stuff that
  deals with ciphers can use it in either ecb, cbc, cfb64 or ofb64 modes.
  There are 3 options for optimising Blowfish.  BF_PTR, BF_PTR2 and 'normal'.
  BF_PTR2 is pentium/x86 specific.  The correct option is setup in
  the 'Configure' script.
- There is now a 'get client certificate' callback which can be
  'non-blocking'.  If more details are required, let me know.  It will
  documented more in SSLv3 when I finish it.
- Bug fixes from 0.6.5 including the infamous 'ca' bug.  The 'make test'
  now tests the ca program.
- Lots of little things modified and tweaked.
