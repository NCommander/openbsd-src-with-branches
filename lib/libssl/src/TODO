- The loading of the netscape RC4 encrypted key is a crock of pig pellets.
  It will be reworked along with a nice general mechanism for encrypting
  ASN.1 stuff. [ Jun 96 ] I've cleaned up private keys internally but
  still have not done PKCS#8 support.

- Winsock support in s_client/s_server for windows nt/3.1 is a crock.
  I will probably not get this fixed for a while, it is just there so
  I could test things.

- Be able to generate DSS certificates.

- Add CRL to the X509 verification stuff, this will probably be added with
  SSLv3.

+ X509 callback.  I need to callback the application to retrieve certificates
  and CRL.
