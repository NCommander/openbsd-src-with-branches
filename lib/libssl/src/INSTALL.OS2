 
 Installation on OS/2
 --------------------

 You need to have the following tools installed:

  * EMX GCC
  * PERL
  * GNU make


 To build the makefile, run

 > os2\os2-emx

 This will configure OpenSSL and create OS2-EMX.mak which you then use to 
 build the OpenSSL libraries & programs by running

 > make -f os2-emx.mak

 If that finishes successfully you will find the libraries and programs in the
 "out" directory.
