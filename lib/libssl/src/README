of SSL and supporting libraries.

The current version of this library is available from

There are patches to a number of internet applications which can be found in

Additional documentation is being slowly written by Eric Young, and is being
added to http://www.cryptsoft.com/ssleay/doc.  It will normally also be
available on http://www.psy.uq.oz.au/~ftp/Crypto/ssleay

THIS LIBRARY IS NOT %100 COMPATABLE WITH SSLeay 0.6.6

The package includes

libssl.a:
	My implementation of SSLv2, SSLv3 and the required code to support
	both SSLv2 and SSLv3 in the one server.

libcrypto.a:
	General encryption and X509 stuff needed by SSL but not
	actually logically part of it.  It includes routines for the following:

  Ciphers
	libdes - My libdes DES encryption package which has been floating
		around the net for a few years.  It includes 15
		'modes/variations' of DES (1, 2 and 3 key versions of ecb,
		cbc, cfb and ofb; pcbc and a more general form of cfb and ofb)
		including desx in cbc mode,
		a fast crypt(3), and routines to read passwords from the
		keyboard.
	RC4 encryption,
	RC2 encryption 		- 4 different modes, ecb, cbc, cfb and ofb.
	Blowfish encryption	- 4 different modes, ecb, cbc, cfb and ofb.
	IDEA encryption		- 4 different modes, ecb, cbc, cfb and ofb.

  Digests
	MD5 and MD2 message digest algorithms, fast implementations,
	SHA (SHA-0) and SHA-1 message digest algorithms,
	MDC2 message digest.  A DES based hash that is polular on smart cards.

  Public Key
	RSA encryption/decryption/generation.  There is no limit
		on the number of bits.
	DSA encryption/decryption/generation.   There is no limit on the
		number of bits.
	Diffie-Hellman key-exchange/key generation.  There is no limit
		on the number of bits.

  X509v3 certificates
	X509 encoding/decoding into/from binary ASN1 and a PEM
		based ascii-binary encoding which supports encryption with
		a private key.
	Program to generate RSA and DSA certificate requests and to
		generate RSA and DSA certificates.

  Systems
  	The normal digital envelope routines and base64 encoding.
	Higher level access to ciphers and digests by name.  New ciphers can be
		loaded at run time.
	The BIO io system which is a simple non-blocking IO abstraction.
		Current methods supported are file descriptors, sockets,
		socket accept, socket connect, memory buffer, buffering,
		SSL client/server, file pointer, encryption, digest,
		non-blocking testing and null.
  Data structures
  	A dynamically growing hashing system
	A simple stack.
	A Configuration loader that uses a format similar to MS .ini files.

Programs in this package include
	enc	- a general encryption program that can encrypt/decrypt using
		one of 17 different cipher/mode combinations.  The
		input/output can also be converted to/from base64
		ascii encoding.
	dgst	- a generate message digesting program that will generate
		message digests for any of md2, md5, sha (sha-0 or sha-1)
		or mdc2.
	asn1parse - parse and display the structure of an asn1 encoded
		binary file.
	rsa	- Manipulate RSA private keys.
	dsa	- Manipulate DSA private keys.
	dh	- Manipulate Diffie-Hellman parameter files.
	dsaparam- Manipulate and generate DSA parameter files.
	crl	- Manipulate certificate revocation lists.
	crt2pkcs7- Generate a pkcs7 object containing a crl and a certificate.
	x509	- Manipulate x509 certificates, self-sign certificates.
	req	- Manipulate PKCS#10 certificate requests and also
		  generate certificate requests.
	genrsa  - Generates an arbitrary sized RSA private key.
	gendh	- Generates a set of Diffie-Hellman parameters, the prime
		  will be a strong prime.
	ca	- Create certificates from PKCS#10 certificate requests.
		  This program also maintains a database of certificates
		  issued.
	verify	- Check x509 certificate signatures.
	speed	- Benchmark SSLeay's ciphers.
	s_server- A test SSL server.
	s_client- A test SSL client.
	s_time	- Benchmark SSL performance of SSL server programs.
	errstr	- Convert from SSLeay hex error codes to a readable form.
	
Documents avaliable are
	A Postscript and html reference manual
	(written by Tim Hudson tjh@cryptsoft.com).

	A list of text protocol references I used.
	An initial version of the library manual.

To install this package, read the INSTALL file.
For the Microsoft word, read MICROSOFT
This library has been compiled and tested on Solaris 2.[34] (sparc and x86),
SunOS 4.1.3, DGUX, OSF1 Alpha, HPUX 9, AIX 3.5(?), IRIX 5.[23],
LINUX, NeXT (intel), linux, Windows NT, Windows 3.1, MSDOS 6.22.

Multithreading has been tested under Windows NT and Solaris 2.5.1

Due to time constraints, the current release has only be rigorously tested
on Solaris 2.[45], Linux and Windows NT.

For people in the USA, it is possible to compile SSLeay to use RSA
Inc.'s public key library, RSAref.  From my understanding, it is
claimed by RSA Inc. to be illegal to use my public key routines inside the USA.
Read doc/rsaref.doc on how to build with RSAref.

Read the documentation in the doc directory.  It is quite rough,
but it lists the functions, you will probably have to look at
the code to work out how to used them.  I will be working on
documentation.  Look at the example programs.

There should be a SSL reference manual which is being put together by
Tim Hudson (tjh@cryptsoft.com) in the same location as this
distribution.  This contains a lot more information that is very
useful.  For a description of X509 Certificates, their use, and
certification, read rfc1421, rfc1422, rfc1423 and rfc1424.  ssl/README
also goes over the mechanism.

We have setup some mailing lists for use by people that are interested
in helping develop this code and/or ask questions.
    ssl-bugs@mincom.oz.au
    ssl-users@mincom.oz.au
    ssl-bugs-request@mincom.oz.au
    ssl-users-request@mincom.oz.au

I have recently read about a new form of software, that which is in
a permanent state of beta release.  Linux and Netscape are 2 good 
examples of this, and I would also add SSLeay to this category.
The Current stable release is 0.6.6.  It has a few minor problems.
0.8.0 is not call compatable so make sure you have the correct version
of SSLeay to link with.
