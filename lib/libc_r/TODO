This is a list of things that still need to be done:

* Fix the totally bogus _atomic_lock in arch/mips

* Add thread stuff to the other archs in libc/arch/; ie change
  some usages of ENTRY to SYSENTRY in some .S files and add
  the new macros to their SYS.h. Only the i386 arch is working.

* Find a better way of doing the _sys_aliases stuff; ideally by
  using the linker. jmp's (current implementation) are ugly, but
  I don't want to have to hack ../libc/sys/Makefile.inc just to
  partition the syscalls into wrapped and non-wrapped. The `.set'
  assembler directive just doesn't work as I thought it would.

* Fix the bug where _thread_init() isn't called when libc_r.so is used
  instead of libc_r.a ... some kind of shlib common problem? may
  need to use crt0 instead? __CTOR_LIST__ is just not being updated by ld.
  Frankly this one is driving me nuts. Maybe <bsd.lib.mk> is wrong.

* Signals seem to cause busy-hangs. SIGINFO especially. test_sock_2
  fails because of its use of signals. still dumps /tmp/uthread.dump
  though - needs debugging.

* Test the objective-C compiler to see if it can use threads.

* Find all the static buffers in libc and make them per-thread. This
  is not absolutely necessary but incurs no penalty for single-threaded
  operation, and makes life easier & safer for when threads are used.
  
* Look into how netbsd are going with their kernel threads

* Look into how asynchronous I/O can help us. In particular, the
  (unimplemented) aio*() functions.

* Update the libc manual pages to describe the posix re-entrant functions.
  Although this is actually trivial to do, I have to decide on a
  consistent way of adding them - maybe `.Sh THREAD-SAFE FUNCTIONS' ?
  Should look into standards to see what they suggest/did..
  May also need to document "This is not thread-safe" for some library
  functions (yet to be identified).
