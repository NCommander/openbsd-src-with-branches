.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sendsyslog
.Nd send a message to syslogd
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/syslog.h
.In sys/types.h
.Ft int
.Fn sendsyslog "const void *msg" "size_t len" "int flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sendsyslog
function is used to transmit a
.Xr syslog 3
formatted message direct to
.Xr syslogd 8
without requiring the allocation of a socket.
If
.Dv LOG_CONS
is specified in the
.Fa flags
argument, and
.Xr syslogd 8
is not accepting messages, the message will be sent to the console.
This is used internally by
.Xr syslog_r 3 ,
so that messages can be sent during difficult situations.
If sending to
.Xr syslogd 8
fails, dropped messages are counted.
When
.Xr syslogd 8
works again, a warning with the counter and error number is logged.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn sendsyslog
can fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
An invalid user space address was specified for a parameter.
.It Bq Er EMSGSIZE
The socket requires that message be sent atomically,
and the size of the message to be sent made this impossible.
.It Bq Er ENOBUFS
The system was unable to allocate an internal buffer.
The operation may succeed when buffers become available.
.It Bq Er ENOTCONN
The message cannot be sent, likely because
.Xr syslogd 8
is not running.

function call appeared in
