.Dt PINSYSCALL 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pinsyscall
.Nd specify the call stub for a specific system call
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/syscall.h
.Ft int
.Fn pinsyscall "int syscall" "void *start" "size_t len"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pinsyscall
system call specifies the
.Va start
to
.Va start + len
range in the
.Pa libc.so
shared library where the call stub for the
specified
.Va syscall
resides.
This range is typically under 80 bytes long, and varies by architecture.
.Pp
Only the
.Va SYS_execve
system call is currently supported.
The shared library linker
.Pa ld.so
automatically tells the kernel about
.Va SYS_execve
at startup.
.Pp
Once the kernel knows the specific location in the address space where
that system call must be entered from, any attempt to use a system-call
entry instruction to perform the specified
.Va syscall
from a different address range will deliver
.Dv SIGABRT .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn pinsyscall
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
Unsupported syscall.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The range between
.Va start
and
.Va start + len
is not in the address space.
.It Bq Er EPERM
The range for the specified syscall has been previously set.
.El
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn pinsyscall
system call first appeared in
.Ox 7.3 .
