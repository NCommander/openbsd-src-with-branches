.Sh NAME
.Nm getentropy
.Nd get entropy
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft int
.Fn getentropy "char *buf" "size_t buflen"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
fills a buffer with high-quality seed-grade entropy, which can
be used as input for process-context random
generators like
.Xr arc4random 3 .
.Pp
The maximum buffer size permitted is 256 bytes.
If
.Va buflen
exceeds this, an error of
.Er EIO
will be indicated.
.Pp
.Nm
is not intended for regular code; please use the
.Xr arc4random 3
family of functions instead.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn getentropy
will succeed unless:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa buf
parameter points to an
invalid address.
.It Bq Er EIO
Too many bytes requested, or some other fatal error occurred.
