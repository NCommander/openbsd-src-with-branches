Please send corrections to this web page to the
<A HREF="mailto:tz@elsie.nci.nih.gov">time zone mailing list</A>.

<H2>The <samp>tz</samp> database</H2><P>
The public-domain time zone database contains code and data
that represent the history of local time
for many representative locations around the globe.
It is updated periodically to reflect changes made by political bodies
to UTC offsets and daylight-saving rules.
This database (often called <samp>tz</samp> or <samp>zoneinfo</samp>)
is used by several implementations,
including BSD, DJGPP, GNU/Linux, HP-UX, IRIX, Solaris, and UnixWare.
In the <samp>tz</samp> database's
<A HREF="ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/">FTP distribution</A>,
the code is in the file <samp>tzcode<var>C</var>.tar.gz</samp>,
where <samp><var>C</var></samp> is the code's version;
similarly, the data are in <samp>tzdata<var>D</var>.tar.gz</samp>,
where <samp><var>D</var></samp> is the data's version.
The code lets you compile the text data into time zone files, one for
each location.  It also lets you read a compiled time zone file and
interpret time stamps for that location.
<P>
The data are by no means authoritative. If you find errors, please
send changes to the <A HREF="mailto:tz@elsie.nci.nih.gov">time zone
mailing list</A>. You can also <A
HREF="mailto:tz-request@elsie.nci.nih.gov">subscribe</A> to the
mailing list, or retrieve the <A
HREF="ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzarchive.gz">archive of old
messages</A> (in <A HREF="http://www.gzip.org/">gzip</A> compressed
format).
