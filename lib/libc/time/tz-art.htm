Artist:		Jules Verne
Book:		Le Tour du Monde en Quatre-Vingts Jours
		(Around the World in Eighty Days)
Notes:		Wall-clock time plays a central role in the plot.
		European readers of the 1870s clearly held the U.S. press in
		deep contempt; the protagonists cross the U.S. without once
		reading a paper.
		An on-line French-language version of the book
		"with illustrations from the original 1873 French-language edition"
		is available at
		<a href="http://fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/tdm80j">http://fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/tdm80j</a>

"A fundamental belief held by Americans is that if you are on land, you
cannot be killed by a fish...So most Americans remain on land, believing
they're safe. Unfortunately, this belief--like so many myths, such as that
there's a reason for 'Daylight Saving Time'--is false."
	Dave Barry column, 2000-07-02
