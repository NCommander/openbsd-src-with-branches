.Nd calculate the RSA Data Security, Inc., ``MDX'' message digest
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <mdX.h>
.Ft void
.Fn MDXInit "MDX_CTX *context"
.Ft void
.Fn MDXUpdate "MDX_CTX *context" "const unsigned char *data" "unsigned int len"
.Ft void
.Fn MDXFinal "unsigned char digest[16]" "MDX_CTX *context"
.Ft "char *"
.Fn MDXEnd "MDX_CTX *context" "char *buf"
.Ft "char *"
.Fn MDXFile "char *filename" "char *buf"
.Ft "char *"
.Fn MDXData "unsigned char *data" "unsigned int len" "char *buf"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The MDX functions calculate a 128-bit cryptographic checksum (digest)
for any number of input bytes.  A cryptographic checksum is a one-way
hash-function, that is, you cannot find (except by exhaustive search)
the input corresponding to a particular output.  This net result is
a ``fingerprint'' of the input-data, which doesn't disclose the actual
input.
.Pp
MD2 is the slowest, MD4 is the fastest and MD5 is somewhere in the middle.
MD2 can only be used for Privacy-Enhanced Mail.
MD4 has been shown to have severe vulnerabilities; it should only be
used where necessary for backward compatibility.
MD5 has not yet (1999-02-11) been broken, but recent attacks have cast
some doubt on its security properties.  The attacks on both MD4 and MD5
are both in the nature of finding ``collisions'' \- that is, multiple
inputs which hash to the same value; it is still unlikely for an attacker
to be able to determine the exact original input given a hash value.
.Pp
The
.Fn MDXInit ,
.Fn MDXUpdate ,
and
.Fn MDXFinal
functions are the core functions.  Allocate an MDX_CTX, initialize it with
.Fn MDXInit ,
run over the data with
.Fn MDXUpdate ,
and finally extract the result using
.Fn MDXFinal .
When a null pointer is passed to
.Fn MDXFinal
as first argument only the final padding will be applied and the
current context can still be used with
.Fn MDXUpdate .
.Pp
.Fn MDXEnd
is a wrapper for
.Fn MDXFinal
which converts the return value to a 33-character
(including the terminating '\e0')
.Tn ASCII
string which represents the 128 bits in hexadecimal.
.Pp
.Fn MDXFile
calculates the digest of a file, and uses
.Fn MDXEnd
to return the result.
If the file cannot be opened, a null pointer is returned.
.Fn MDXData
calculates the digest of a chunk of data in memory, and uses
.Fn MDXEnd
to return the result.
.Pp
When using
.Fn MDXEnd ,
.Fn MDXFile ,
or
.Fn MDXData ,
the
.Ar buf
argument can be a null pointer, in which case the returned string
is allocated with
.Xr malloc 3
and subsequently must be explicitly deallocated using
.Xr free 3
after use.
If the
.Ar buf
argument is non-null it must point to at least 33 characters of buffer space.

.Sh AUTHOR
The original MDX routines were developed by

.Sh HISTORY
These functions appeared in
.Ox 2.0 .
.Sh BUGS
Hans Dobbertin has shown collisions for the full version of MD4 and
found a collision in the compress function of MD5. The use of SHA or
RIPEMD-160 is recommended instead.
.Pp
MD2 has only been licensed for use in Privacy Enhanced Mail.
Use MD4 or MD5 if that isn't what you're doing.
