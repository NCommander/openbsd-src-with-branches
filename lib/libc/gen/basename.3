.Sh NAME
.Nm basename ,
.Nm dirname
.Nd extract the base or directory portition of a pathname
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <libgen.h>
.Ft char *
.Fn basename "char *path"
.Ft char *
.Fn dirname "char *path"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn basename
function
returns the last componenent from the pathname pointed to by
.Ar path ,
deleting any trailing '/' characters.  If
.Ar path
consists entirely of '/' characters, a pointer to the string "/"
is returned.  If
.Ar path
is a NULL pointer or the empty string, a pointer to the string "."
is returned.
.Pp
The
.Fn dirname
function
is the converse of
.Fn basename ;
it returns a pointer to the parent directory of the pathname pointed to by
.Ar path .
Any trailing '/' characters are not counted as part of the directory
name.  If
.Ar path
is a NULL pointer, the empty string, or contains no '/' characters,
.Fn dirname
returns a pointer to the string ".", signifying the current directory.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On successful completion,
.Fn basename
returns a pointer to the last component of
.Ar path.
.Pp
On successful completion,
.Fn dirname
returns a pointer to the parent directory of
.Ar path.
.Pp
If
.Fn basename
or
.Fn dirname
fail, a NULL pointer is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The following error codes may be set in
.Va errno :
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
the path component to be returned was larger than
.Va MANPATHLEN .
.Sh WARNINGS
Both
.Fn basename
and
.Fn dirname
return pointers to internal static storage space that will be overwritten
by subsequent calls (each function has its own separate storage).
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr basename 1 ,
.Xr dirname 1
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn basename
