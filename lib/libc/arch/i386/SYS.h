 * Design note:
 *
 * When the syscalls need to be renamed so they can be handled
 * specially by the threaded library, these macros insert `_thread_sys_'
 * in front of their name. This avoids the need to #ifdef _THREAD_SAFE 
 * everywhere that the renamed function needs to be called.
 * The PASSTHRU macro is later used for system calls that don't need
 * wrapping. (XXX its a shame the loader can't do this aliasing)
