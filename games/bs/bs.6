.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm bs
.Op Fl b | s
.Op Fl c
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This program allows you to play the familiar Battleships game against the
computer on a 10x10 board.  The interface is visual and largely
self-explanatory; you place your ships and pick your shots by moving the
cursor around the
.Sq sea
with the rogue/hack motion keys
.Em hjklyubn .
.Pp
Note that when selecting a ship to place, you must type the capital letter
(these are, after all, capital ships).  During ship placement, the
.Sq r
command may be used to ignore the current position and randomly place your
currently selected ship.  The
.Sq R
command will place all remaining ships randomly.  The ^L
command (form feed, ASCII 12) will force a screen redraw).
.Sh OPTIONS
The command-line arguments control game modes.
.Bl -tag -width XxXXX
.It Fl b
Selects a
.Sq blitz
variant.  This allows a side to shoot for as long as it continues to score
hits.
.It Fl s
Selects a
.Sq salvo
variant.  This allows a player one shot per turn for each of his/her
ships still afloat.  This puts a premium on scoring hits early and knocking out
some ships and also makes it much harder, for example, when you face a superior
force with only your PT-boat.
.It Fl c
Permits ships to be placed adjacently.  Normally, ships must be separated by
at least one square of open water.  This disables that check and allows them
to close-pack.

.Sh AUTHORS
Originally written by one Bruce Holloway in 1986.
Salvo mode added by Chuck A.  DeGaul (cbosgd!cad).
Visual user interface,
.Sq closepack
option, code rewrite
and manual page by Eric S. Raymond <esr@snark.thyrsus.com> August 1989.
.Sh NOTES
The algorithm the computer uses once it has found a ship to sink is provably
optimal.  The dispersion criterion for the random-fire algorithm may not be.
