/* The next def turns on the change to the algorithm introduced by NIST at

 * Cypherpunks mailing list on June 21, 1994 (as told to us by Steve Bellovin):
 *
 *	This is the fix to the Secure Hash Standard, NIST FIPS PUB 180:
 *
 *	     In Section 7 of FIPS 180 (page 9), the line which reads
 *
 *	     "b) For t=16 to 79 let Wt = Wt-3 XOR Wt-8 XOR Wt-14 XOR
 *	     Wt-16."
 *
 *	     is to be replaced by
 *
 *	     "b) For t=16 to 79 let Wt = S1(Wt-3 XOR Wt-8 XOR Wt-14 XOR
 *	     Wt-16)."
 *
 *	     where S1 is a left circular shift by one bit as defined in
 *	     Section 3 of FIPS 180 (page 6):
 *
 *	     S1(X) = (X<<1) OR (X>>31).
