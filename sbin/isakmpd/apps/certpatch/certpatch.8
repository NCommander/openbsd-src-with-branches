.Sh NAME
.Nm certpatch
.Nd add subjectAltName identities to X.509 certificates
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm certpatch
.Op Fl t Ar identity-type
.Fl i
.Ar identity
.Fl k
.Ar signing-key
.Ar input-certificate output-certificate
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
alters PEM-encoded X.509 certificates by adding a subjectAltName extension
containing an identity used by the signature-based authentication schemes
of the ISAKMP protocol.
After the addition the certificate will be signed
once again with the supplied CA signing key.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl t Ar identity-type
If given, the
.Fl t
option specifies the type of the given identity.
Currently
.Li ip ,
.Li fqdn ,
and
.Li ufqdn
are recognized.
The default is
.Li ip .
.It Fl i Ar identity
The
.Fl i
option takes an argument which is the identity to put into the
subjectAltName field of the certificate.
If the identity-type is
.Li ip ,
this argument should be an IPv4 address in dotted decimal notation.
.It Fl k Ar signing-key
The
.Fl k
option specifies the key used for signing the certificate once the
subjectAltName extension has been added.
The key is specified by
the filename where it is stored in PEM format.
