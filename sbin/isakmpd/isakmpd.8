.Sh NAME
.Nm isakmpd
.Nd ISAKMP/Oakley aka IKE key management daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm isakmpd
.Op Fl c Ar config-file
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl D Ar debug-class=level
.Op Fl f Ar fifo
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl p Ar listen-port
.Op Fl P Ar local-port
.Op Fl r Ar seed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm ISAKMP
daemon establishes security associations for encrypted
and/or authenticated network traffic. 
.Pp
The daemon listens to a named pipe 
.Pa isakmpd.fifo
for user requests and on a
.Nm PF_ENCAP
socket for kernel requests.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
If given, the
.Fl c
option specifies an alternate configuration file instead of
.Pa /etc/isakmpd.conf .
.It Fl d
The
.Fl d
option is used to make the daemon run in the foreground, logging to stderr.
.It Fl D
This argument is possible to specify many times.  It takes a parameter of
the form: class=level where both class and level are numbers.  Class denotes
a debugging class, and level the level you want that debugging class to
limit debug printouts at.  I.e. all debug printouts above the level specified
will not output anything.
.It Fl f
The
.Fl f
option specifies the fifo (aka named pipe) where the daemon listens for
user requests.  If the path given is a dash,
.Nm isakmpd
will listen to stdin instead.
.It Fl n
When the
.Fl n
option is given, the kernel will not take part in the negotiations.
This is a non-destructive mode so to say, in that it won't alter any
SAs in the IPSEC stack.
.It Fl r
If given a deterministic random number sequence will be used internally.
This is useful for setting up regression tests.
.It Fl p
The
.Fl p
option specifies the listen port the daemon will bind to.
.It Fl P
On the other hand, the port spcified to capital
.Fl P
will be what the daemon binds its local end to when acting as initiator.
