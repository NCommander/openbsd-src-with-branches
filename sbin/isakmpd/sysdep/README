In order to find system dependent files for your favourite operating system, go to
ftp.gsnig.net or ftp.appli.se and visit pub/isakmpd.  In there you will find packages
for other systems isakmpd has been ported to.  We chose not to ship these as part of the
OpenBSD tree as some of them are quite big.  Sorry for the inconvenience.
