.Sh NAME
.Nm isakmpd.conf
.Nd configuration file for isakmpd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file for the
.Nm isakmpd
daemon managing security association and key management for the
IPsec layer of the kernel's networking stack.
.Pp
The file is of a well known type of format called .INI style, named after
the suffix used by an overrated windowing environment for its configuration
files.
This format consists of sections, each beginning with a line looking like:
.Bd -literal
[Section name]
.Ed
Between the brackets is the name of the section following this section header.
Inside a section many tag/value pairs can be stored, each one looking like:
.Bd -literal
Tag=Value
.Ed
If the value needs more space than fits on a single line it's possible to
continue it on the next by ending the first with a backslash character
immediately before the newline character.
This method can extend a value for an arbitrary amount of lines.
.Pp
Comments can be put anywhere in the file by using a hash mark
.Pq Sq \&# .
Then the comment goes on to the end of the line.
.Pp
Often the right-hand side values consist of other section names.
This results in a tree structure.
Some values are treated as a list of several scalar values, such lists always
use comma as the separator.
Some values are formatted like this: X,Y:Z, which
is an offer/accept syntax, where X is a value we offer and Y:Z is a range of
accepted values, inclusive.
.Pp
To activate changes to
.Nm
without restarting
.Nm isakmpd ,
send a SIGHUP signal to the daemon process.
.Ss Auto-generated parts of the configuration
.Pp
Some predefined section names are recognized by the daemon, voiding the need
to fully specify the Main Mode transforms and Quick Mode suites, protocols
and transforms.
.Pp
For Main Mode:
.Bd -filled -compact
.Ar {DES,BLF,3DES,CAST}-{MD5,SHA}[-GRP{1,2,5}][-{DSS,RSA_SIG}]
.Ed
.Pp
For Quick Mode:
.Bd -filled -compact
.Ar QM-{proto}[-TRP]-{cipher}[-{hash}][-PFS[-{group}]]-SUITE
.Ed
.Bd -literal
  where
    {proto}  is either ESP or AH
    {cipher} is either DES, 3DES, CAST, BLF or AES
    {hash}   is either MD5, SHA or RIPEMD
    {group}  is either GRP1, GRP2 or GRP5
.Ed
.Pp
Example 1: 3DES-SHA means; 3DES encryption, SHA hash, and authorization by
pre-shared keys.
Example 2: QM-ESP-3DES-SHA-PFS-SUITE means; ESP protocol, 3DES encryption,
SHA hash, and use Perfect Forward Security.
.Pp
.Pp
Unless explicitly stated with -GRP1, 2 or 5, transforms and PFS suites
use DH group 2. There are currently no predefined ESP+AH Quick Mode suites.
.Pp
The predefinitions include some default values for the special
sections "General", and "X509-certificates". These default values are
presented in the example below.
.Pp
All autogenerated values can be overridden by manual entries by using the
same section and tag names in the configuration file.
In particular, the default phase 1 (Main or Aggressive Mode) and phase 2
(Quick Mode) lifetimes can be overridden by these tags under the "General"
section;
.Pp
.Bd -literal
[General]
Default-phase-1-lifetime=	3600,60:86400
Default-phase-2-lifetime=	1200,60:86400
.Ed
.Pp
The Main Mode lifetime currently defaults to one hour (minimum 60
seconds, maximum 1 day). The Quick Mode lifetime defaults to 20
minutes (minimum 60 seconds, maximum 1 day).
.\"XXX Following empty .Ss works around a nroff bug, we want the new line."
.Ss
.Pp
Also, the default Phase 1 ID can be set by creating a <Phase1-ID>
section, as shown below, and adding this tag under the "General"
section;
.Pp
.Bd -literal
[General]
Default-phase-1-ID=		Phase1-ID-name

[Phase1-ID-name]
ID-type=			USER_FQDN
Name=				foo@bar.com
.Ed
.\"XXX Following empty .Ss works around a nroff bug, we want the new line."

.Bl -hang -width 12n
.It Em General
Generic global configuration parameters
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It Em Policy-file
The name of the file that contains
.Xr KeyNote 4
policies.
The default is "/etc/isakmpd/isakmpd.policy".
.It Em Default-Phase-2-Suites
A list of Phase 2 suites that will be used when establishing dynamic
SAs.
If left unspecified, QM-ESP-3DES-SHA-PFS-SUITE is used as the default.
.It Em Retransmits
How many times should a message be retransmitted before giving up.
.It Em Check-interval
The interval between watchdog checks of connections we want up at all times.
.It Em Exchange-max-time
How many seconds should an exchange maximally take to setup
before we give up.
.It Em Listen-on
A list of IP-addresses OK to listen on.
This list is used as
a filter for the set of addresses the interfaces configured
provides.
This means that we won't see if an address given
here does not exist on this host, and thus no error is given for
that case.
.It Em Shared-SADB
If this tag is defined, whatever the value is, some semantics of
.Nm
are changed so that multiple instances can run on top of one SADB
and setup SAs with eachother.
Specifically this means replay
protection will not be asked for, and errors that can occur when
updating an SA with its parameters a 2nd time will be ignored.
.It Em Pubkey-directory
The directory in which
.Nm
looks for explicitly trusted public keys.
The default is "/etc/isakmpd/pubkeys".
Read
.Xr isakmpd 8
for the required naming convention of the files in here.
.El
.It Em Phase 1
ISAKMP SA negotiation parameter root
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It Em <IP-address>
A name of the ISAKMP peer at the given IP-address.
.It Em Default
A name of the default ISAKMP peer.
Incoming Phase 1 connections from other IP-addresses will use this peer name.
.It ""
This name is used as the section name for further information to be found.
Look at <ISAKMP-peer> below.
.El
.It Em Phase 2
IPsec SA negotiation parameter root
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It Em Connections
A list of directed IPsec "connection" names that should be brought up
automatically, either on first use if the system supports it, or at
startup of the daemon.
These names are section names where further information can be found.
Look at <IPsec-connection> below.
Normally any connection mentioned here are treated as part of the
"Passive-connection" list we present below, however there is a
flag: "Active-only" that disables this behaviour.
This too is mentioned in the <IPsec-connection> section, in the "Flags" tag.
.It Em Passive-connections
A list of IPsec "connection" names we recognize and accept initiations for.
These names are section names where further information can be found.
Look at <IPsec-connection> below.
Currently only the Local-ID and Remote-ID tags
are looked at in those sections, as they are matched against the IDs given
by the initiator.
.El
.It Em KeyNote
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It Em Credential-directory
A directory containing directories named after IDs (IP
addresses, ``user@domain'', or hostnames) that contain files named
``credentials'' and ``private_key''.
.Pp
The credentials file contains
.Xr keynote 4
credentials that are sent to a remote IKE daemon when we use the
associated ID, or credentials that we may want to consider when doing
an exchange with a remote IKE daemon that uses that ID.
Note that, in the former case, the last credential in the file
MUST contain our public key in its Licensees field.
More than one credentials may exist in the file.
They are separated by whitelines (the format is essentially the same as
that of the policy file).
The credentials are of the same format as the policies described in
.Xr isakmpd.policy 5 .
The only difference is that the Authorizer field contains a public
key, and the assertion is signed.
Signed assertions can be generated using the
.Xr keynote 1
utility.
.Pp
The private_key file contains the private RSA key we use for
authentication.
If the directory (and the files) exist, they take precedence over X509-based
authentication.
.El
.It Em X509-Certificates
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It Em Ca-directory
A directory containing PEM certificates of certification authorities
that we trust to sign other certificates.
Note that for a CA to be really trusted, it needs to be somehow
referred to by policy, in
.Xr isakmpd.policy 5 .
The certificates in this directory are used for the actual X.509
authentication and for cross-referencing policies that refer to
Distinguished Names (DNs).
Keeping a separate directory (as opposed to integrating policies
and X.509 CA certificates) allows for maintenance of a list of
"well known" CAs without actually having to trust all (or any) of them.
.It Em Cert-directory
A directory containing PEM certificates that we trust to be valid.
These certificates are used in preference to those passed in messages and
are required to have a SubjectAltName extension.
.It Em Accept-self-signed
If this tag is defined, whatever the value is, certificates that
do not originate from a trusted CA but are self-signed will be
accepted.
.It Em Private-key
The private key matching the public key of our certificate (which should be
in the "Cert-directory", and have a subjectAltName matching our ID, so far
that is our IP-address).
.El
.El
.Ss Referred-to sections
.Bl -hang -width 12n
.It Em <ISAKMP-peer>
Parameters for negotiation with an ISAKMP peer
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It Em Phase
The constant
.Li 1 ,
as ISAKMP-peers and IPsec-connections
really are handled by the same code inside isakmpd.
.It Em Transport
The name of the transport protocol, defaults to
.Li UDP .
.It Em Port
In case of
.Li UDP ,
the
.Li UDP
port number to send to.
This is optional, the
default value is 500 which is the IANA-registered number for ISAKMP.
.It Em Local-address
The Local IP-address to use, if we are multi-homed, or have aliases.
.It Em Address
If existent, the IP-address of the peer.
.It Em Configuration
The name of the ISAKMP-configuration section to use.
Look at <ISAKMP-configuration> below.
.It Em Authentication
If existent, authentication data for this specific peer.
In the case of preshared key, this is the key value itself.
.It Em ID
If existent, the name of the section that describes the
local client ID that we should present to our peer.
If not present, it
defaults to the address of the local interface we are sending packets
over to the remote daemon.
Look at <Phase1-ID> below.
.It Em Remote-ID
If existent, the name of the section that describes the remote client
ID we expect the remote daemon to send us.
If not present, it defaults to the address of the remote daemon.
Look at <Phase1-ID> below.
.It Em Flags
A comma-separated list of flags controlling the further
handling of the ISAKMP SA.
Currently there are no specific ISAKMP SA flags defined.
.El
.It Em <Phase1-ID>
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It Em ID-type
The ID type as given by the RFC specifications.
For Phase 1 this is currently
.Li IPV4_ADDR ,
.Li IPV4_ADDR_SUBNET ,
.Li IPV6_ADDR ,
.Li IPV6_ADDR_SUBNET ,
.Li FQDN ,
.Li USER_FQDN
or
.Li KEY_ID .
.It Em Address
If the ID-type is
.Li IPV4_ADDR
or
.Li IPV6_ADDR ,
this tag should exist and be an IP-address.
.It Em Network
If the ID-type is
.Li IPV4_ADDR_SUBNET
or
.Li IPV6_ADDR_SUBNET
this tag should exist and
be a network address.
.It Em Netmask
If the ID-type is
.Li IPV4_ADDR_SUBNET
or
.Li IPV6_ADDR_SUBNET
this tag should exist and
be a network subnet mask.
.It Em Name
If the ID-type is
.Li FQDN ,
.Li USER_FQDN
or
.Li KEY_ID ,
this tag should exist and contain a domain name, user@domain, or
other identifying string respectively.
.Pp
In the case of
.Li KEY_ID ,
note that the IKE protocol allows any octet sequence to be sent or
received under this payload, potentially including non-printable
ones.
.Xr isakmpd 1
can only transmit printable
.Li KEY_ID
payloads, but can receive and process arbitrary
.Li KEY_ID
payloads.
This effectively means that non-printable
.Li KEY_ID
remote identities cannot be verified through this means, although it
is still possible to do so through
.Xr isakmpd.policy 5 .

derivation and authentication in Phase 1), or ANY.
.It Em Life
A list of lifetime descriptions, or ANY.
In the former case, each
element is in itself a name of the section that defines the lifetime.
Look at <Lifetime> below.
If it is set to ANY, then any type of
proposed lifetime type and value will be accepted.
.El
.It Em <Lifetime>
.Bl -tag -width 12n

.Li SECONDS
or
.Li KILOBYTES
depending on the type of the duration.
Notice that this field may NOT be set to ANY.

It is also used when we act as responders to find out what
<IPsec-connection> we are dealing with.
Look at <IPsec-ID> below.
.It Em Remote-ID
If existent, the name of the section that describes the
optional remote client ID that we should present to our peer.
