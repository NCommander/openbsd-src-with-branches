.Sh NAME
.Nm isakmpd.conf
.Nd configuration file for isakmpd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file for the
.Nm isakmpd
daemon managing security association and key management for the
IPSEC layer of the kernel's networking stack.
.Pp
The file is of a well known type of format called .INI style, named after
the suffix used by an overrated windowing environment for its configuration
files.  This format consists of sections, each beginning with a line looking
like:
.Bd -literal
[Section name]
.Ed
Between the brackets is the name of the section following this section header.
Inside a section many tag/value pairs can be stored, each one looking like:
.Bd -literal
Tag=Value
.Ed
If the value needs more space than fits on a single line it's possible to
continue it on the next by ending the first with a backspace character
immediately before the newline character.  This method can extend a value for
an arbitrary amount of lines.
.Pp
Comments can be put anywhere in the file by using a hash mark
.Pq Sq \&# .
Then the comment goes on to the end of the line.
.Pp
Often the right-hand side values consist of other section names.
This results in a tree structure.
Some values are treated as a list of several scalar values, such lists always
use comma as the separator.  Some values are formated like this: X,Y:Z, which
is an offer/accept syntax, where X is a value we offer and Y:Z is a range of
accepted values, inclusive.
.Pp
.Ss Roots
.Bl -hang -width 12n
.It Em General
Generic global configuration parameters
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It Em Retransmits
How many times should a message be retransmitted before giving up.
.It Em Check-interval
The interval between watchdog checks of connections we want up at all times.
.It Em Exchange-max-time
How many seconds should an exchange maximally take to setup
before we give up.
.It Em Listen-on
A list of IP-addresses OK to listen on.  This list is used as
a filter for the set of addresses the interfaces configured
provides.  This means that we won't see if an address given
here does not exist on this host, thus no error is given for
that case.
.It Em Shared-SADB
If this tag is defined, whatever the value is, some semantics of
.Nm
are changed so that multiple instances can run on top of one SADB
and setup SAs with eachother.  Specifically this means replay
protection will not be asked for, and errors that can occur when
updating an SA with its parameters a 2nd time will be ignored.
.El
.It Em Phase 1
ISAKMP SA negotiation parameter root
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It Em <IP-address>
A name of the ISAKMP peer at the given IP-address.  This name
is used as the section name for further information to be
found.  Look at <ISAKMP-peer> below.
.El
.It Em Phase 2
IPsec SA negotiation parameter root
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It Em Connections
A list of directed IPSec "connection" names that should be brought up
automatically, either on first use if the system supports it, or at
startup of the daemon.  These names are section names where further
information can be found.  Look at <IPSec-connection> below.
Normally any connection mentioned here are treated as part of the
"Passive-connection" list we present below, however there is a
flag: "Active-only" that disables this behaviour.  This too is
mentioned in the <IPSec-connection> section, in the "Flags" tag.
.It Em Passive-connections
A list of IPSec "connection" names we recognize and accept initiations for.
These names are section names where further information can be found.  Look
at <IPSec-connection> below.  Currently only the Local-ID and Remote-ID tags
are looked at in those sections, as they are matched against the IDs given
by the initiator.
.El
.El
.Ss Referred-to sections
.Bl -hang -width 12n
.It Em <ISAKMP-peer>
Parameters for negotiation with an ISAKMP peer

.It Em Flags
A comma-separated list of flags controlling the further
handling of the IPSec SA.  Currently only one flag is defined:
.Dv Stayalive ,
which means that after the expiration of an ISAKMP SA, the initiator
side will automatically renegotiate for a new SA of the same name.
.It Em Next-hop
A Linux FreeS/WAN specific value which should be the IP address of the
next hop along the path to reach the peer, usually a router.

An offer/accept kind of value, see above.
.El
.It Em <IPSec-connection>
