.Sh NAME
.Nm isakmpd.conf
.Nd configuration file for isakmpd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file for the
.Nm isakmpd
daemon managing security association and key management for the
IPSEC layer of the kernel's networking stack.
.Pp
The file is of a well known type of format called .INI style, named after
the suffix used by an overrated windowing environment for its configuration
files.
This format consists of sections, each beginning with a line looking like:
.Bd -literal
[Section name]
.Ed
Between the brackets is the name of the section following this section header.
Inside a section many tag/value pairs can be stored, each one looking like:
.Bd -literal
Tag=Value
.Ed
If the value needs more space than fits on a single line it's possible to
continue it on the next by ending the first with a backslash character
immediately before the newline character.
This method can extend a value for an arbitrary amount of lines.
.Pp
Comments can be put anywhere in the file by using a hash mark
.Pq Sq \&# .
Then the comment goes on to the end of the line.
.Pp
Often the right-hand side values consist of other section names.
This results in a tree structure.
Some values are treated as a list of several scalar values, such lists always
use comma as the separator.
Some values are formatted like this: X,Y:Z, which
is an offer/accept syntax, where X is a value we offer and Y:Z is a range of
accepted values, inclusive.
.Pp
.Ss Auto-generated parts of the configuration
.Pp
Some predefined section names are recognized by the daemon, voiding the need
to fully specify the Main Mode transforms and Quick Mode suites, protocols 
and transforms.
.Pp
For Main Mode:
.Bd -filled -compact
.Ar {DES,BLF,3DES,CAST}-{MD5,SHA}[-{DSS,RSA_SIG}]
.Ed
.Pp
For Quick Mode:
.Bd -filled -compact
.Ar QM-{ESP,AH}[-TRP]-{DES,3DES,CAST,BLF,AES}[-{MD5,SHA,RIPEMD}][-PFS]-SUITE
.Ed
.Pp
Example 1: 3DES-SHA means; 3DES encryption, SHA hash, and authorization by 
pre-shared keys.
Example 2: QM-ESP-3DES-SHA-PFS-SUITE means; ESP protocol, 3DES encryption, 
SHA hash, and use Perfect Forward Security.
.Pp
There are two predefined lifetimes used. The Main Mode lifetime,
named LIFE_MAIN_MODE, currently 
defaults to one hour (minimum 60 seconds, maximum 1 day). The Quick Mode 
lifetime,
LIFE_QUICK_MODE,
defaults to 20 minutes (minimum 60 seconds, maximum 1 day).
.Pp
In addition, the predefinitions include some default values for the special
sections "General", and "X509-certificates".  These values are presented in
the example below.
.Pp
Note that using the predefined section names imply some minor limitations.
There are currently no predefined ESP+AH Quick Mode suites, and the 
Diffie-Hellman group description for Main Mode (and Quick Mode with PFS) is
set to DH group 1 (MODP_768) when using MD5 hash, and DH group 2 (MODP_1024) 
when using SHA hash.
.Pp
All autogenerated values can be overridden by manual entries by using the 
same section and tag names in the configuration file.
.Pp
In particular, the default phase 1 (Main or Aggressive Mode) and phase 2 
(Quick Mode) lifetimes can be overridden by these tags under the "General" 
section;
.Pp
.Bd -literal
[General]
Default-phase-1-lifetime=	3600,60:86400
Default-phase-2-lifetime=	1200,60:86400
.Ed
.\"XXX Following empty .Ss works around a nroff bug, we want the new line."
.Ss
.Pp
Also, the default Phase 1 ID can be set by creating a <Phase1-ID>
section, as shown below, and adding this tag under the "General"
section;
.Pp
.Bd -literal
[General]
Default-phase-1-ID=		Phase1-ID-name

[Phase1-ID-name]
ID-type=			USER_FQDN
Name=				foo@bar.com
.Ed
.\"XXX Following empty .Ss works around a nroff bug, we want the new line."

.Bl -hang -width 12n
.It Em General
Generic global configuration parameters
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It Em Policy-file
The name of the file that contains
.Xr KeyNote 4
policies.
The default is "/etc/isakmpd/isakmpd.policy".
.It Em Retransmits
How many times should a message be retransmitted before giving up.
.It Em Check-interval
The interval between watchdog checks of connections we want up at all times.
.It Em Exchange-max-time
How many seconds should an exchange maximally take to setup
before we give up.
.It Em Listen-on
A list of IP-addresses OK to listen on.
This list is used as
a filter for the set of addresses the interfaces configured
provides.
This means that we won't see if an address given
here does not exist on this host, and thus no error is given for
that case.
.It Em Shared-SADB
If this tag is defined, whatever the value is, some semantics of
.Nm
are changed so that multiple instances can run on top of one SADB
and setup SAs with eachother.
Specifically this means replay
protection will not be asked for, and errors that can occur when
updating an SA with its parameters a 2nd time will be ignored.
.El
.It Em Phase 1
ISAKMP SA negotiation parameter root
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It Em <IP-address>
A name of the ISAKMP peer at the given IP-address.
.It Em Default
A name of the default ISAKMP peer.  Incoming
Phase 1 connections from other IP-addresses will use this peer name.
.It ""
This name is used as the section name for further information to be found.
Look at <ISAKMP-peer> below.
.El
.It Em Phase 2
IPsec SA negotiation parameter root
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It Em Connections
A list of directed IPSec "connection" names that should be brought up
automatically, either on first use if the system supports it, or at
startup of the daemon.
These names are section names where further information can be found.
Look at <IPSec-connection> below.
Normally any connection mentioned here are treated as part of the
"Passive-connection" list we present below, however there is a
flag: "Active-only" that disables this behaviour.
This too is mentioned in the <IPSec-connection> section, in the "Flags" tag.
.It Em Passive-connections
A list of IPSec "connection" names we recognize and accept initiations for.
These names are section names where further information can be found.
Look at <IPSec-connection> below.
Currently only the Local-ID and Remote-ID tags
are looked at in those sections, as they are matched against the IDs given
by the initiator.
.El
.It Em KeyNote
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It Em Credential-directory
A directory containing directories named after IDs (IP
addresses, ``user@domain'', or hostnames) that contain files named
``credentials'' and ``private_key''.
.Pp
The credentials file contains
.Xr keynote 4
credentials that are sent to a remote IKE daemon when we use the
associated ID, or credentials that we may want to consider when doing
an exchange with a remote IKE daemon that uses that ID. Note that, in
the former case, the last credential in the file MUST contain our
public key in its Licensees field. More than one credentials may exist
in the file. They are separated by whitelines (the format is
essentially the same as that of the policy file). The credentials are
of the same format as the policies described in
.Xr isakmpd.policy 5 .
The only difference is that the Authorizer field contains a public
key, and the assertion is signed. Signed assertions can be generated
using the
.Xr keynote 1
utility.
.Pp
The private_key file contains the private RSA key we use for
authentication. If the directory (and the files) exist, they take
precedence over X509-based authentication.
.El
.It Em X509-Certificates
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It Em Ca-directory
A directory containing PEM certificates of certification authorities
that we trust to sign other certificates.  Note that for a CA to be
really trusted, it needs to be somehow referred to by policy, in
.Xr isakmpd.policy 5 .
The certificates in this directory are used for the actual X.509
authentication and for cross-referencing policies that refer to
Distinguished Names (DNs). Keeping a separate directory (as opposed
to integrating policies and X.509 CA certificates) allows for maintenance
of a list of "well known" CAs without actually having to trust all (or any)
of them.
.It Em Cert-directory
A directory containing PEM certificates that we trust to be valid.
These certificates are used in preference to those passed in messages and
are required to have a SubjectAltName extension.
.It Em Accept-self-signed
If this tag is defined, whatever the value is, certificates that
do not originate from a trusted CA but are self-signed will be
accepted.
.It Em Private-key
The private key matching the public key of our certificate (which should be
in the "Cert-directory", and have a subjectAltName matching our ID, so far
that is our IP-address).
