.Sh NAME
.Nm isakmpd.conf
.Nd Configuration file for isakmpd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm isakmpd.conf
is the configuration file for
.Nm isakmpd
daemon managing security association and key management for the
.Nm IPSEC
layer of the kernel's networking stack.
.Pp
The file is of a well known type of format called .INI style, named after
the suffix used by an overrated windowing environment for its configuration
files.  This format consists of sections, each beginning with a line looking
like:
.Bd -literal
[Section name]
.Ed
Between the brackets is the name of the section following this section header.
Inside a section many tag/value pairs can be stored, each one looking like:
.Bd -literal
Tag=Value
.Ed
If the value needs more space than fits on a single line it's possible to
continue it on the next by ending the first with a backspace character
immediately before the newline character.  This method can extend a value for
an arbitrary amount of lines.
.Pp
Comments can be put anywhere in the file by using a hash mark, "#".  Then
the comment goes on to the end of the line.
.Pp
.Sh EXAMPLE
An example of a configuration file:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
# A configuration sample for the isakmpd ISAKMP/Oakley (aka IKE) daemon.
