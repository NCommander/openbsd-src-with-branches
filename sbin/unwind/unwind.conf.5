and may contain any of those characters.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example,
.Ic forwarder ,
.Ic port ,
or
.Ic Dot ) .
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
fwd1=192.0.2.53
fwd2=192.0.2.153

.Nm unwind
can detect when it is running behind a
.Dq captive portal
by sending an HTTP request and checking the response against the
configured expected response.
The check is triggered when
.Xr dhclient 8
reports new nameservers.
If the response does not match,
.Nm unwind
uses the DHCP provided nameservers and periodically re-checks if the user
passed the captive portal.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic captive portal Brq ...
Captive portal
detection is configured inside the
.Ic captive portal
block.
.Bl -tag -width "url URL"

The default is 200.
.It Ic auto Op Cm yes | Cm no
When
.Ic auto
is set to
.Cm yes
.Nm unwind
automatically triggers a captive portal check
when the network is changed.
When set to
.Cm no
a captive portal check can be triggered by
