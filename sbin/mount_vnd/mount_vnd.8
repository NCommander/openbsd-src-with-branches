.Dt MOUNT_VND 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_vnd
.Nd configure a vnd image
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mount_vnd
.Op Fl k
.Op Fl K Ar rounds
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Op Fl S Ar saltfile
.Ar image
.Ar node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command configures an image file named
.Ar image
using
.Xr vnconfig 8 .
.Pp
This command is invoked by
.Xr mount 8
when using the following syntax:
.Bd -ragged -offset 4n
.Nm mount Op options
-t vnd
.Ar image Ar node
.Ed
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl K Ar rounds
Flag is passed on to
.Xr vnconfig 8 .
It is used to associate an encryption key using a salt file
and a specified number of
.Ar rounds
for PKCS #5 PBKDF2 with the vnd device.
.It Fl k
Flag is passed on to
.Xr vnconfig 8 .
It is used to associate an encryption key with the vnd device.
.It Fl o Ar options
Options are specified with a
.Fl o
flag followed by a comma separated string of options.
See the
.Xr mount 8
man page for possible options and their meanings.
.Pp
At the moment,
.Fl o
is only here for compatibility reasons, but no use is made of supplied
options.
.It Fl S Ar saltfile
Flag is passed on to
.Xr vnconfig 8 .
It is used to specify the name of the saltfile used with
.Fl K .
If the salt filename is not specified using
.Fl S ,
it defaults to
.Ar image Ns .slt .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Some possible vnd configurations for
.Pa /etc/fstab
are listed below.
.Pp
For lines with type
.Dq ffs ,
the
.Dq noauto
option must be set to prevent a
.Xr mount 8
of the FFS partitions
before the necessary vnd devices are configured.
Also, the
.Dq fs_passno
field has to be set to 0 to prevent
.Xr fsck 8
from checking the file system for the same reasons.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Ox 4.2 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An David Krause .
.Sh BUGS
Checking filesystems within svnd images using
.Xr fsck 8
at boot time, as well as mounting them at that point of time is not yet
possible, because the mount option
.Dq noauto
still is necessary at the moment.
