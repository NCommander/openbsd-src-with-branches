.Sh NAME
.Nm ipfstat
.Nd reports on packet filter statistics and filter lists
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ipfstat
.Op Fl aAfhIinosv

By default,
.Nm
displays current kernel statistics gathered
as a result of applying the filters in place (if any) to packets going through
the kernel.
.Pp
When supplied with either
.Fl i
or
.Fl o ,
it will retrieve and display
the appropriate list of filter rules currently installed and in use by the
kernel.
.Pp
.Nm
examines
.Pa /dev/kmem
using the symbols
.Sy _fr_flags ,
.Sy _frstats ,
.Sy _filterin ,
and
.Sy _filterout .
To run and work, it needs to be able to read both
.Pa /dev/kmem
and the kernel itself.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width "-d device"
.It Fl a
Display the accounting filter list and show bytes counted against each rule.
Used with
.Fl i
or
.Fl o .
.It Fl A

.It Fl h
Show per-rule the number of times each one scores a
