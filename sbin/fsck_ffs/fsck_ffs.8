.Sh DESCRIPTION
The first form of
.Nm
preens a standard set of filesystems or the specified filesystems.
It is normally used in the script
.Pa /etc/rc
during automatic reboot.
Here
.Nm
reads the table
.Pa /etc/fstab
to determine which filesystems to check.
Only partitions in fstab that are mounted
.Dq rw ,
.Dq rq ,
or
.Dq ro
and have non-zero pass numbers are checked.
Filesystems with pass number 1 (normally just the root filesystem)
are checked one at a time.
When pass 1 completes, all remaining filesystems are checked,
running one process per disk drive.
The disk drive containing each filesystem is inferred from the longest prefix
of the device name that ends in a digit; the remaining characters are assumed
to be the partition designator.
.Pp
The kernel takes care that only a restricted class of innocuous filesystem
inconsistencies can happen unless hardware or software failures intervene.
These are limited to the following:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact
.It
Unreferenced inodes
.It
Link counts in inodes too large
.It
Missing blocks in the free map
.It
Blocks in the free map also in files
.It
Counts in the super-block wrong
.El
.Pp
These are the only inconsistencies that
.Nm
with the
.Fl p
option will correct; if it encounters other inconsistencies, it exits
with an abnormal return status and an automatic reboot will then fail.
For each corrected inconsistency one or more lines will be printed
identifying the filesystem on which the correction will take place,
and the nature of the correction.
After successfully correcting a filesystem,
.Nm
will print the number of files on that filesystem,
the number of used and free blocks,
and the percentage of fragmentation.
.Pp
If sent a
.Dv QUIT
signal,
.Nm
will finish the filesystem checks, then exit with an abnormal
return status that causes an automatic reboot to fail.
This is useful when you want to finish the filesystem checks during an
automatic reboot,
but do not want the machine to come up multiuser after the checks complete.
.Pp
Without the
.Fl p
option,
.Nm
audits and interactively repairs inconsistent conditions for filesystems.
If the filesystem is inconsistent the operator is prompted for concurrence
before each correction is attempted.
It should be noted that some of the corrective actions which are not
correctable under the
.Fl p
option will result in some loss of data.
The amount and severity of data lost may be determined from the diagnostic
output.
The default action for each consistency correction
is to wait for the operator to respond
.Dq yes
or
.Dq no .
If the operator does not have write permission on the filesystem,
.Nm
will default to a
.Fl n
action.
.Pp
.Nm fsck
has more consistency checks than
its predecessors
.Em check , dcheck , fcheck ,
and
.Em icheck
combined.
.Pp
The following flags are interpreted by
.Nm fsck_ffs :
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f
Force checking of file systems.
Normally, if a file system is cleanly unmounted, the kernel will set a
.Dq clean flag
in the file system superblock and
.Nm
will not check the file system.
This option forces
.Nm
to check the file system, regardless of the state of the clean flag.
.It Fl b Ar block#
Use the
.Ar block
specified as
the super block for the filesystem.
Block 32 is usually an alternate super block.
.It Fl m Ar mode
Use the
.Ar mode
specified in octal as the
permission bits to use when creating the
.Pa lost+found
directory rather than the default 1700.
In particular, systems that wish to have lost files accessible
by all users on the system should use a less restrictive
set of permissions such as 755.
.It Fl y
Assume a
.Dq yes
response to all questions asked by
.Nm fsck_ffs ;
this should be used with great caution as this is a free license
to continue after essentially unlimited trouble has been encountered.
.It Fl n
Assume a
.Dq no
response to all questions asked by
.Nm
except for
.Dq CONTINUE? ,
which is assumed to be affirmative;
do not open the filesystem for writing.
.It Fl c Ar level
Convert the filesystem to the specified
.Ar level .
Note that the level of a filesystem can only be raised.
.Bl -tag -width indent
There are currently four levels defined:
.It 0
The filesystem is in the old (static table) format.
.It 1
The filesystem is in the new (dynamic table) format.
.It 2
The filesystem supports 32-bit UIDs and GIDs,
short symbolic links are stored in the inode,
and directories have an added field showing the file type.
.It 3
If
.Va maxcontig
is greater than one,
build the free segment maps to aid in finding contiguous sets of blocks.
If
.Va maxcontig
is equal to one, delete any existing segment maps.
.El
.Pp
In interactive mode,
.Nm
will list the conversion to be made
and ask whether the conversion should be done.
If a negative answer is given,
no further operations are done on the filesystem.
In preen mode,
the conversion is listed and done if
possible without user interaction.
Conversion in preen mode is best used when all the filesystems
are being converted at once.
The format of a filesystem can be determined from the
first line of output from
.Xr dumpfs 8 .
.El
.Pp
If no filesystems are given to
.Nm
then a default list of filesystems is read from
the file
.Pa /etc/fstab .
.Pp
.Bl -enum -indent indent -compact
Inconsistencies checked are as follows:
.Pp
.It
Blocks claimed by more than one inode or the free map.
.It
Blocks claimed by an inode outside the range of the filesystem.
.It
Incorrect link counts.
.It
Size checks:
.Bl -item -indent indent -compact
.It
Directory size not a multiple of DIRBLKSIZ.
.It
Partially truncated file.
.El
.It
Bad inode format.
.It
Blocks not accounted for anywhere.
.It
Directory checks:
.Bl -item -indent indent -compact
.It
File pointing to unallocated inode.
.It
Inode number out of range.
.It
Dot or dot-dot not the first two entries of a directory
or having the wrong inode number.
.El
.It
Super Block checks:
.Bl -item -indent indent -compact
.It
More blocks for inodes than there are in the filesystem.
.It
Bad free block map format.
.It
Total free block and/or free inode count incorrect.
.El
.El
.Pp
Orphaned files and directories (allocated but unreferenced) are,
with the operator's concurrence, reconnected by
placing them in the
.Pa lost+found
directory.
The name assigned is the inode number.
If the
.Pa lost+found
directory does not exist, it is created.
If there is insufficient space its size is increased.
.Pp
Because of inconsistencies between the block device and the buffer cache,
the raw device should always be used.
