/*
 * dpme.h - Disk Partition Map Entry (dpme)
 *
 * Written by Eryk Vershen
 *
 * This file describes structures and values related to the standard
 * Apple SCSI disk partitioning scheme.
 *
 * Each entry is (and shall remain) 512 bytes long.
 *
 * For more information see:
 *	"Inside Macintosh: Devices" pages 3-12 to 3-15.
 *	"Inside Macintosh - Volume V" pages V-576 to V-582
 *	"Inside Macintosh - Volume IV" page IV-292
 *
 * There is a kernel file with much of the same info (under different names):
 *	/usr/src/mklinux-1.0DR2/osfmk/src/mach_kernel/ppc/POWERMAC/mac_label.h
