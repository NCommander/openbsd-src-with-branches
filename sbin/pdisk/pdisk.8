.Dt PDISK 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pdisk
.Nd HFS(DPME) partition maintenance program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pdisk
.Op Fl lr
.Ar disk
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a menu driven program which partitions disks using the standard Apple
disk partitioning scheme described in
.Dq Inside Macintosh: Devices .
It does not support the Intel/DOS partitioning scheme supported by
.Xr fdisk 8 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl l
List the partition map for the specified
.Ar disk .
.It Fl r
Prevents
.Nm
from writing to the disk.
.It Ar disk
Specify the
.Ar disk
to operate on.
It can be specified either by its full pathname or an abbreviated disk form.
In its abbreviated form, the path to the device, the
.Sq r
denoting
.Dq raw device ,
and the partition letter, can all be omitted.
For example, the first IDE disk can be specified as either
.Pa /dev/rwd0c ,
.Pa /dev/wd0c ,
or
.Ar wd0 .
.El
.Sh COMMAND MODE
The list of commands and their explanations are given below.
.Bl -tag -width "update"
.It Em ?\&
verbose command help
.It Em C
create a partition of a specified type
.It Em c
create an
.Ox
partition
.It Em d
delete a partition
.It Em f
full display of a partition
.It Em h
command help
.It Em i
(re)initialize the partition map
.It Em n
(re)name a partition
.It Em P
show the partition map's data structures
.It Em p
print the partition map
.It Em q
quit editing
.It Em r
reorder an entry in the partition map
.It Em s
change the size of the partition map
.It Em t
change the type of a partition
.It Em w
write the partition map to disk
.El
.Pp
Commands which take arguments prompt for each argument in turn.
You can also type any number of the arguments separated by spaces
and those prompts will be skipped.
The only exception to typeahead are the confirmation prompts on the
.Em i
and
.Em w
commands.
The idea being that if we expect you to confirm the decision we
shouldn't undermine that by allowing you to be precipitate about it.
.Pp
Partitions are always specified by their number,
which is the index of the partition entry in the partition map.
Most of the commands will change the index numbers of all partitions
after the affected partition.
You are advised to print the partition map as frequently as necessary.
.Pp
Creating more than fifteen partitions is not advised, for
compatibility reasons.
.Pp
The
.Em c
(create new partition) command is the only one with complicated arguments.
The first argument is the base address (in blocks) of the partition.
Besides a raw number, you can also specify a partition number followed
by the letter 'p' to indicate that the first block of the new partition should
be the same as the first block of that existing free space partition.
The second argument is the length of the partition in blocks.
This can be a raw number or can be a partition number followed by the
letter 'p' to use the size of that partition or can be a number followed
by 'k', 'm', 'g', or 't' to indicate the size in kilobytes, megabytes,
gigabytes or terabytes respectively.
(These are powers of 1024, of course, not powers of 1000.)
The last argument is the name of the partition.
This can be a single word without quotes, or a string surrounded by
single or double quotes.
The type of the created partition is the correct type for
.Ox .
.Pp
The
.Em C
command is identical to the
.Em c
command, with the addition of a partition type argument after the
other arguments.
.Pp
The
.Em n
(name) command allows the name of a partition to be changed.
Note that the various "Apple_Driver" partitions depend
on the name field for proper functioning.
.Pp
The
.Em r
(reorder) command allows the index number of partitions to be changed.
The index numbers are constrained to be a contiguous sequence.
.Pp
The
.Em t
(change type) command allows the type of an existing partition to be changed.
Examples of valid partition types are: Apple_Free, Apple_HFS, and
.Ox .
The
.Em i
(initialize) command initializes the partition map.
.Pp
The
.Em w
(write) command writes the partition map out.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility was originally developed for MkLinux.

It was ported to
