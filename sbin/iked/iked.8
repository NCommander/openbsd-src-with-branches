.Sh NAME
.Nm iked
.Nd Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm iked
.Op Fl dnSTv

.Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
.Oc
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) daemon which performs mutual
authentication and which establishes and maintains IPsec flows and
security associations (SAs) between the two peers.
.Pp
The IKEv2 protocol is defined in RFC 4306,
which combines and updates the previous standards:
ISAKMP/Oakley (RFC 2408),
IKE (RFC 2409),
and the Internet DOI (RFC 2407).
.Nm
only supports the IKEv2 protocol;
support for
ISAKMP/Oakley and IKEv1
is provided by
.Xr isakmpd 8 .
.Pp
.Nm
supports mutual authentication using RSA public keys and X.509 certificates.
See the
.Sx FILES
section below and
.Sx PKI AND CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY COMMANDS
in
.Xr ikectl 8
for more information about creating and maintaining the public key
infrastructure.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
Define
.Ar macro
to be set to
.Ar value
on the command line.
Overrides the definition of
.Ar macro
in the configuration file.
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl f Ar file
Use
.Ar file
as the configuration file, instead of the default
.Pa /etc/iked.conf .
.It Fl n
Configtest mode.
Only check the configuration file for validity.
.It Fl S
Start
.Nm
in passive mode.
See the
.Ic set passive
option in
.Xr iked.conf 5
for more information.
.It Fl T
Disable NAT-Traversal and do not propose NAT-Traversal support to the peers.
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/iked/private/XXX" -compact
.It Pa /etc/iked.conf
The default
.Nm
configuration file.
.It Pa /etc/iked/ca/
The directory where CA certificates are kept.
.It Pa /etc/iked/certs/
The directory where IKE certificates are kept, both the local
certificate(s) and those of the peers, if a choice to have them kept
permanently has been made.
.It Pa /etc/iked/crls/
The directory where CRLs are kept.
.It Pa /etc/iked/private/
The directory where local private keys used for public key authentication
are kept.
The file
.Pa local.key
is used to store the local private key.
.It Pa /etc/iked/pubkeys/
