.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Op Fl s Ar socket
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) daemon for clients.
It requests IP configuration information from for example those offered by
.Xr dhcpd 8 ,
on interfaces with the
.Sy AUTOCONF4
flag set.
See
.Xr hostname.if 5
and
.Xr ifconfig 8
on how to enable auto configuration on an interface.
.Pp
.Nm
monitors network interface states (interface going up or down,
auto configuration enabled or disabled etc.) and sends requests
when necessary.
.Pp
A running
.Nm
can be controlled with the
.Xr dhcpleasectl 8
utility.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl s Ar socket

.It Fl v

Multiple
.Fl v
options increase the verbosity.
