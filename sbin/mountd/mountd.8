.Sh NAME
.Nm mountd
.Nd service remote
.Tn NFS
mount requests
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /sbin/mountd
.Op Fl dn
.Op Ar exportsfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Xr Mountd
is the server for
.Tn NFS
mount requests from other client machines.
.Xr Mountd
listens for service requests at the port indicated in the
.Tn NFS
server specification; see
.%T "Network File System Protocol Specification" ,
RFC1094, Appendix A and
.%T "NFS: Network File System Version 3 Protocol Specification" ,
Appendix I.
.Pp
Options and operands available for
.Nm mountd :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Enable debugging mode.
.Xr Mountd
will not detach from the controlling terminal and will print
debugging messages to stderr.
.It Fl n
Do not require that clients make mount requests from reserved ports.
(Normally, only mount requsts from reserved ports are accepted.)
This option should only be specified if there are clients, such as PC's,
that need it.
.It Ar exportsfile
The
.Ar exportsfile
argument specifies an alternate location
for the exports file.
.El
.Pp
When mountd is started,
it loads the export host addresses and options into the kernel
using the mount(2) system call.
After changing the exports file,
a hangup signal should be sent to the mountd daemon
to get it to reload the export information.
After sending the SIGHUP
(kill \-HUP `cat /var/run/mountd.pid`),
check the syslog output to see if mountd logged any parsing
errors in the exports file.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/mountd.pid -compact
.It Pa /etc/exports
the list of exported filesystems
.It Pa /var/run/mountd.pid
the pid of the currently running mountd
