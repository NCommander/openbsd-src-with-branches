.Sh NAME
.Nm startkey
.Nd start keying with photurisd
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm startkey
.Op Fl d Ar directory
.Ar options ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility attemps to contact the
.Xr photurisd 8
daemon and initalize a key exchange. The flags are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Ar directory
The
.Fl d
option specifies the directory in which
.Xr photurisd
looks for its startup files. The default is
.Pa /etc/photuris/ .
.El
.Pp
The options
.Ic dst ,
.Ic port ,
.Ic options ,
.Ic tsrc ,
.Ic tdst ,
.Ic exchange_lifetime ,
.Ic spi_lifetime
and
.Ic user
are understood by the daemon.
The meanings are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width options -offset indent
.It Ic dst
The destination IP address with which the exchange is to be established.
.It Ic port
The port number of the destination
.Xr photuris
daemon.
.It Ic options
The options to be used in the exchange. Possible values are
.Dq enc
and
.Dq auth .
.It Ic tsrc
If both
.Ic tsrc
and
.Ic tdst
(see below) are specified, a tunnel (IP over IP) is setup.  The
.Ic tsrc
option is a network address with netmask used for matching the source
IP address of a packet.  When both the source and the destination
addresses match their respective options the packet will be routed into the
tunnel.
.It Ic tdst
If both
.Ic tsrc
(see above) and
.Ic tdst
are specified, a tunnel (IP over IP) is setup.  The
.Ic tdst
option is a network address with netmask used for matching the destination
IP address of a packet.  When both the source and the destination
addresses match their respective options the packet will be routed into the
tunnel.
.It Ic exchange_lifetime
Determines the lifetime of the exchange. After an exchange expires
no new SPIs are created, which means the transport or tunnel is torn down
as soon as the current SPI times out (see
.Ic spi_lifetime
below).  The default value is gotten from the
.Ic exchange_lifetime
parameter given in
.Pa photuris.conf .
If it is not given there the default is 1800 seconds.
.It Ic spi_lifetime
Determines the lifetime of each created SPI in the exchange.
.It Ic user
The user name for whom the keying shall be done. Preconfigured
secrets are taken from the users secret file.

.Sh EXAMPLE
startkey dst=169.200.12.23 options=auth
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/photuris/photuris.pipe -compact
.It Pa /etc/photuris/photuris.pipe
FIFO in which keying requests are written
