.Nm reboot
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl q
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Sy Power fail and crash recovery.
Normally, the system will reboot itself at power-up or after crashes.
An automatic consistency check of the file systems will be performed
as described in
.Xr fsck 8 .
and unless this fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.
.Pp
.Sy Cold starts
The SPARC system currently uses the SunOS bootstrap loaders.
This will be changed in a future version of the system.
The SunOS boot will attempt to load
.Pa netbsd
from partition A of the boot device,
which must currently be an ``sd'' disk.
.Pp
The
.Op Fl s
flag to the SunOS boot loader will being the system up in single-user mode.
The
.Op Fl a
flag instructs the system to prompt for the location of the root filesystem
and the primary swap partition.
.\"The
.\".Op Fl d
.\"flag to the SunOS boot loader will bring the system up in debug mode.
.\"Here it waits for a kernel debugger connect; see
.\".Xr kgdb 8 .
Other flags are currently ignored.
.Pp
The Sparc boot rom comes in two flavours: an ``old-style'' rom is used in
sun4 machines, while A ``new-style'' rom can be found on sun4c and sun4m models.
The ``new-style'' Sparc boot rom is a full-featured Forth system with emacs
key bindings. It can be put in ``old-style'' user-interface compatibility
mode (in which case it shows a simple `>' prompt), but this is essentially
useless. However, by default the rom runs in old-mode; to enter new-mode type `n'.
The rom then shows a Forth-style `ok' prompt. It is recommended to have
the rom always start in its native ``new-style'' mode. Utter the following
incantation in new-mode to force the rom to always start in new-mode.
.Pp
.Pa \	ok
setenv sunmon-compat? false
.Pp
The rom will normally load the kernel from "sd(0,0,0)vmunix". To change the
default so that
.Pa NetBSD
will be loaded type the following
.Pp
.Pa \	ok
setenv boot-from sd(0,0,0)netbsd
.Pp
At any time you can break back to the rom by pressing the `L1' and `a'
keys at the same time (if the console is a serial port the same is
achieved by sending a `break').
If you do this accidentally you can continue whatever was in progress
by typing `go'.

.Sh BUGS
The use of Sun disk labels, without the ability to write them,
is problematic.
