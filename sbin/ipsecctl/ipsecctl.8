.Sh NAME
.Nm ipsecctl
.Nd control flows for IPsec
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ipsecctl
.Op Fl dFnv
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl s Ar modifier
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility controls flows that determine which packets are to be processed by
IPsec.
It allows ruleset configuration, and retrieval of status information from the
kernel's SPD (Security Policy Database) and SADB (Security Association
Database).
.Pp
It also can control
.Xr isakmpd 8
and establish tunnels using automatic keying with
.Xr isakmpd 8 .
.Pp
Additionally,
.Nm
can be used to configure the SADB for use with TCP MD5
signatures, as described in RFC 2385.
See
.Xr tcp 4
for details.
.Pp
The ruleset grammar is described in
.Xr ipsec.conf 5 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
When the
.Fl d
option is set, specified flows will be deleted from the SPD.
Otherwise,
.Nm
will add flows.
.It Fl F
The
.Fl F
option flushes the SPD and the SADB.
.It Fl f Ar file
Load the rules contained in
.Ar file .
.It Fl n
Do not actually load rules, just parse them.
.It Fl s Ar modifier
Show the kernel's databases, specified by
.Ar modifier
(may be abbreviated):
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxx -compact
.It Fl s Cm flow
Show the ruleset loaded into the SPD.
.It Fl s Cm sa
Show the active SADB entries.
.It Fl s Cm all
Show all of the above.
.El
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.
A second use of
.Fl v
will produce even more verbose output.
