.Sh NAME
.Nm ipsecctl
.Nd control flows for IPsec
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ipsecctl
.Op Fl dFmnv
.Oo Fl D Ar macro Ns =
.Ar value Oc
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl s Ar modifier
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility controls flows that determine which packets are to be processed by
IPsec.
It allows ruleset configuration, and retrieval of status information from the
kernel's SPD (Security Policy Database) and SAD (Security Association
Database).
It also can control
.Xr isakmpd 8
and establish tunnels using automatic keying with
.Xr isakmpd 8 .
The ruleset grammar is described in
.Xr ipsec.conf 5 .
.Pp
When the variable
.Va ipsec
is set to
.Dv YES
in
.Xr rc.conf.local 8 ,
the rule file specified with the variable
.Va ipsec_rules
(by default
.Pa /etc/ipsec.conf )
is loaded automatically by the
.Xr rc 8
scripts.
The keying daemon,
.Xr isakmpd 8 ,
can also be enabled to run at boot time via the
.Va isakmpd_flags
variable.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
Define
.Ar macro
to be set to
.Ar value
on the command line.
Overrides the definition of
.Ar macro
in the ruleset.
.It Fl d
When the
.Fl d
option is set, specified flows will be deleted from the SPD.
Otherwise,
.Nm
will add flows.
.It Fl F
The
.Fl F
option flushes the SPD and the SAD.
.It Fl f Ar file
Load the rules contained in
.Ar file .
.It Fl m
Continuously display all
.Dv PF_KEY
messages exchanged with the kernel.
.It Fl n
Do not actually load rules, just parse them.
.It Fl s Ar modifier
Show the kernel's databases, specified by
.Ar modifier
(may be abbreviated):
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxx -compact
.It Fl s Cm flow
Show the ruleset loaded into the SPD.
.It Fl s Cm sa
Show the active SAD entries.
.It Fl s Cm all
Show all of the above.
.El
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.
A second use of
.Fl v
will produce even more verbose output.
