.Sh NAME
.Nm pfctl
.Nd control the packet filter (PF) and network address translation (NAT) device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pfctl
.Op Fl AdehnNqrRvzO
.Op Fl a Ar anchor[:ruleset]
.Op Fl F Ar modifier
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl k Ar host
.Op Fl s Ar modifier
.Op Fl x Ar level
.Op Fl t Ar table
.Op Fl T Ar command
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility communicates with the packet filter device using the
ioctl interface described in
.Xr pf 4 .
It allows ruleset and parameter configuration and retrieval of status
information from the packet filter.
.Pp
Packet filtering restricts the types of packets that pass through
network interfaces entering or leaving the host based on filter
rules as described in
.Xr pf.conf 5 .
The packet filter can also replace addresses and ports of packets.
Replacing source addresses and ports of outgoing packets is called
NAT (Network Address Translation) and is used to connect an internal
network (usually reserved address space) to an external one (the
Internet) by making all connections to external hosts appear to
come from the gateway.
Replacing destination addresses and ports of incoming packets
is used to redirect connections to different hosts and/or ports.
A combination of both translations, bidirectional NAT, is also
supported.
Translation rules are described in
.Xr pf.conf 5 .
.Pp
When the variable pf is set to YES in
.Xr rc.conf 8 ,
the rule file specified with the variable pf_rules
is loaded automatically by the
.Xr rc 8
scripts and the packet filter is enabled.
.Pp
The packet filter does not itself forward packets between interfaces.
Forwarding can be enabled by setting the
.Xr sysctl 8
variables
.Li net.inet.ip.forwarding
and/or
.Li net.inet6.ip6.forwarding ,
to 1. Set them permanently in
.Xr sysctl.conf 5 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility provides several commands.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a Ar anchor Ns Op Ar :ruleset
Apply flags
.Fl f ,
.Fl F
and
.Fl s
only to the rules in the specified
.Pa anchor
and optional named ruleset
.Ar ruleset .
In addition to the main ruleset,
.Nm
can load and manipulate additional rulesets by name.
Named rulesets are attached at
.Pa anchor
points, which are also referenced by name.
Evaluation of
.Pa anchor
rules from the main ruleset is described in
.Xr pf.conf 5 .
.It Fl A
Load only the queue rules present in the rule file.
Other rules and options are ignored.
.It Fl d
Disable the packet filter.
.It Fl e
Enable the packet filter.
.It Fl f Ar file
Load rule file. This file may contain scrub, nat, queue and filter
rules, in that order.
.It Fl F Ar modifier
Flush one of the following.
Modifier name may be abbreviated:
.Bl -tag -width "F tables " -compact
.It Fl F Ar nat
Flush the NAT rules.
.It Fl F Ar queue
Flush the queue rules.
.It Fl F Ar rules
Flush the filter rules.
.It Fl F Ar state
Flush the state table (NAT and filter).
.It Fl F Ar info
Flush the filter information (statistics that are not bound to rules).
.It Fl F Ar Tables
Flush the tables.
.It Fl F Ar all
Flush all of the above.
.El
.It Fl k Ar host
Kill all of the state entries from the specified host.
A second
.Fl k Ar host
option may be specified, which will kill all the state entries
from the first host to the second host.
.Bd -literal
Example:
      Kill all of the state entries from host
    # pfctl -k host

      Kill all of the state entries from host1 to host2
    # pfctl -k host1 -k host2
.Ed
.It Fl h
Help.
.It Fl n
Do not actually load rules, just parse them.
.It Fl N
Load only the NAT rules present in the rule file. Filter rules and options are
ignored
.It Fl q
Only print errors and warnings.
.It Fl r
Perform reverse DNS lookups on states when displaying them.
.It Fl R
Load only the filter rules present in the rule file.
Other rules and options are ignored.
.It Fl O
Load only the options present in the rule file.
Other rules and options are ignored.
.It Fl s Ar modifier
Show filter parameters.
Modifier names may be abbreviated:
.Bl -tag -width "s timeouts " -compact
.It Fl s Ar nat
Show the currently loaded NAT rules.
.It Fl s Ar queue
Show the currently loaded queue rules.
When used together with -v, per-queue statistics are also shown.
When used together with -v -v,
.Nm
will loop and show updated queue statistics every five seconds, including
measured bandwidth and packets per second.
.It Fl s Ar rules
Show the currently loaded filter rules.
When used together with -v, the per-rule statistics (number of evaluations,
packets and bytes) are also shown.
Note that the 'skip step' optimization done automatically by the kernel
will skip evaluation of rules where possible.
Packets passed statefully are counted in the rule that created the state
(even though the rule isn't evaluated more than once for the entire
connection).
.It Fl s Ar Anchors
Show the currently loaded anchors.
If
.Fl a
is specified, the named rulesets currently loaded in the specified
anchor are shown instead.
.It Fl s Ar state
Show the contents of the state table.
.It Fl s Ar info
Show filter information (statistics and counters).
.It Fl s Ar labels
Show per-rule statistics (in terse format) of filter rules with labels,
useful for accounting.
.It Fl s Ar timeouts
Show the current global timeouts.
.It Fl s Ar memory
Show the current pool memory hard limits.
.It Fl s Ar Tables
Show the list of tables.
.It Fl s Ar all
Show all of the above.
.El
.It Fl t Ar table
Specify the name of the table.
.It Fl T Ar command
Specify the command to apply to the table. commands include:
.Bl -tag -width "T Replace " -compact
.It Fl T Ar create
Create a new table.
.It Fl T Ar kill
Kill a table.
.It Fl T Ar flush
Flush all addresses of a table.
.It Fl T Ar add
Add one or more addresses in a table.
Automatically create a nonexisting table.
.It Fl T Ar delete
Delete one or more addresses from a table.
.It Fl T Ar replace
Replace the addresses of the table.
Automatically create a nonexisting table.
.It Fl T Ar show
Show the content (addresses) of a table.
.It Fl T Ar test
Test if the given addresses match a table.
.It Fl T Ar zero
Clear all the statistics of a table.
.It Fl T Ar load
Load only the table definitions from pf.conf.
Used in "pfctl -Tl -f pf.conf".
.El
For the
.Ar add
.Ar delete
.Ar replace
and
.Ar test
commands, the list of addresses can be specified either directly on the command
line and/or in an unformatted text file, using the
.Fl f
flag.
#-starting comments are allowed in the text file.
With theses commands, the
.Fl v
flag can also be used once or twice, in which case pfctl will print the
detailed result of the operation for each individual address, prefixed by
one of the following letter:
.Bl -tag -width XXX -compact
.It A
The address/network has been added.
.It C
The address/network has been changed (negated).
.It D
The address/network has been deleted.
.It M
The address match (test operation only).
.It X
The address/network is duplicated and therefore ignored.
.It Y
The address/network cannot be added/deleted due to conflicting "!" attribute.
.El
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.  A second use of
.Fl v
will produce an additional level of more verbose output.
.It Fl x Ar level
Set the debug level to one of the following.
Level names may be abbreviated:
.Bl -tag -width "x urgent " -compact
.It Fl x Ar none
Don't generate debug messages.
.It Fl x Ar urgent
