.Sh NAME
.Nm pfctl
.Nd control the packet filter and NAT subsystems
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pfctl
.Ar commands
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility communicates with the packet filter system using the
ioctl interface described in
.Xr pf 4 .
.Pp
Packet filtering lets you restrict packets entering or leaving
your host; packets can be specified in a variety of ways including
by protocol, by port number, and by address.
Network Address Translation lets you map a series of internal
host IP numbers to a single external address.
The NAT code also has provision for redirecting a
range of connections to a different host and/or port number.
Taken together this provides a powerful basic firewall mechanism.
.Pp
The
.Nm
command is normally invoked automatically at system initialization
time to start and load the packet filter,
but can also be used when the filter or translation rules change.
.Pp
To use
.Nm
successfully, you must:
.Bl -enum
.It
Be running a kernel with
.Xr pf 8
configured in (the GENERIC kernel qualifies);
.It
Have written a rules and/or nat file;
.It
If you are forwarding packets (using NAT), have enabled 
.Li net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
in the file
.Pa /etc/sysctl.conf ,
and rebooted since enabling it.
.El
.Pp
For this mechanism to be started when the system reboots,
you should enable IPF and IPNAT in 
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
as well.

.Nm
utility provides several commands:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "parse" -compact
.It Cm start

.It Cm stop
