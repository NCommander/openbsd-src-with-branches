.Sh NAME
.Nm pfctl
.Nd control the packet filter and NAT subsystems
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pfctl
.Op Fl dehnqv
.Op Fl F Ar modifier
.Op Fl l Ar interface
.Op Fl N Ar file
.Op Fl R Ar file
.Op Fl s Ar modifier
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility communicates with the packet filter system using the
ioctl interface described in
.Xr pf 4 .
.Pp
Packet filtering lets you restrict packets entering or leaving
your host; packets can be specified in a variety of ways including
by protocol, by port number, and by address.
Network Address Translation lets you map a series of internal
host IP numbers to a single external address.
The NAT code also has provision for redirecting a
range of connections to a different host and/or port number.
Taken together this provides a powerful basic firewall mechanism.
.Pp
The
.Nm
command is normally invoked automatically at system initialization
time to start and load the packet filter,
but can also be used when the filter or translation rules change.
.Pp
.Nm
requires the
.Xr pf 4
pseudo-device driver.
Forwarding packets, by using NAT, also requires specifying
.Li net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
in the file
.Pa /etc/sysctl.conf .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility provides several commands.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Disable the packet filter.
.It Fl e
Enable the packet filter.
.It Fl F Ar modifier
Flush one of the following.
Modifier name may be abbreviated:
.Bl -tag -width "F rules " -compact
.It Fl F Ar nat
Flush the NAT rules.
.It Fl F Ar rules
Flush the filter rules.
.It Fl F Ar state
Flush the state table (NAT and filter).
.It Fl F Ar info
Flush the filter information (statistics and counters).
.It Fl F Ar all
Flush all of the above.
.El
.It Fl h
Help.
.It Fl l Ar interface
Enable collection of packet and byte count statistics for interface named
.Ar interface .
These statistics can be viewed with the
.Fl s Ar info
option.
.It Fl n
Do not actually load rules.
.It Fl N Ar file
Load a NAT rules file.
.It Fl q
Only print errors and warnings.
.It Fl R Ar file
Load a filter rules file into the filter.
.It Fl s Ar modifier
Show filter parameters. Modifier names may be abbreviated.
.Bl -tag -width "s rules " -compact
.It Fl s Ar nat
Show the currently loaded NAT rules.
.It Fl s Ar rules
Show the currently loaded packet filter rules.
.It Fl s Ar state
Show the contents of the state table.
.It Fl s Ar info
Show filter information (statistics and counters).
.It Fl s Ar all
Show all of the above.
.El
.It Fl v
Show rules as they are parsed.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/nat.conf" -compact
.It Pa /etc/pf.conf
Packet filter rules file.
.It Pa /etc/nat.conf
