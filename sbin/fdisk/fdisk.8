.Sh NAME
.Nm fdisk
.Nd DOS partition maintenance program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ie
.Op Fl f Ar mbrname
.Op Fl c Ar cyls
.Op Fl h Ar heads
.Op Fl s Ar sects
.Ar device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
In order for the BIOS to boot the kernel, certain conventions must be
adhered to.  Sector 0 of a bootable hard disk must contain boot code,
a MBR partition table, and a magic number.  These MBR partitions (also
known as BIOS partitions) can be used to break the disk up into several
pieces.  The BIOS loads sector 0 of the boot disk into memory, verifies
the magic number, and begins executing the code at the first byte.
The normal DOS MBR boot code searches the MBR partition table for an
`active' partition (indicated by a `*' in the fist column), and if one
is found, the boot block from that partition is loaded and executed in
place of the original (MBR) boot block.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width "-f mbrname"
.It Fl i
Initialize the MBR sector.
.It Fl e
Edit existing MBR sectors.
.It Fl f Ar mbrname
Specifies an alternate MBR template file.
.It Fl c,h,s
Specify an alternate BIOS geometry for
.Nm
to use.
.El
.Pp
The DOS
.Nm
program can be used to divide space on the disk into partitions and set
one active.
This 
.Nm
program serves a similar purpose to the DOS program.
When called with no special flags, it prints the MBR partition
table of the specified device, ie.
.Bd -literal

.Ed
.Pp
The geometry displayed is the BIOS geometry unless another geometry
has been selected using the
.Fl c ,
.Fl h ,
and
.Fl s
options. 
.Pp
This disk is divided into two partitions that happen to fill the disk.
The first partition overlaps the third partition.  (Used for debugging
purposes)
.Bl -tag -width "start/size"
.It Em "#"
Number of partition table entry.  A '*' denotes the bootable partition.
.It Em "id"
System identifier.
.oS
reserves the
magic number 166 decimal (A6 in hex).
If no 166 partition is found, it will use an older FreeBSD partition
(with a magic number of 165 or A5 in hex).
.It Em "cyl/hd/sec"
These fields provide the starting and ending address of the partition
in BIOS geometry
.It Em "start/size"
These fields provide the starting sector and size in sectors of the
partition in linear block addresses.
.El
.Pp
.Em "NOTE:"
Note that the sectors field is `1 based', and the start field is
`0 based'.  The CHS values will need to be in the BIOS's geometry
for the system to be able to boot and use the drive correctly.
.Pp
The
.Fl i
flag is used to indicate that the partition data is to be initialized.
In this mode,
.Nm
will completely overwrite the primary MBR, and start with a fresh one using
a default template, or one given by the
.Fl f
flag.  It will set up partition number 3 to be an
.oS
partition, that will start at cylinder 0, head 1, sector 1, and extend
to the end of the disk.
This mode is designed to initialize an MBR the very first time,
or when it has been corrupted beyond repair.  It is almost equivalent
to the DOS command `FDISK /MBR'.
.Pp
The flag
.Fl e
is used to modify a partition table using a interactive edit mode of the
.Nm
program.  This mode is designed to allow you to change any partition on the
drive you choose, including extended partitions.  It is a very powerfull mode,
but is safe as long as you do not execute the
.Em write
command, or answer in the negative (the default) when
.Nm
askes you about writing out changes.
.Sh COMMAND MODE
When you first enter this mode, you are presented with a prompt, that looks
like so:
.Em "fdisk: 0>" .
This prompt has two important pieces of information for you.  It will tell
you if the in memory copy of the boot block has been modified or not.  If it
has been modified, the prompt will change to look like:
.Em "fdisk:*0>" .
The second piece of information pertains to the number given in the prompt.
This number specifies the disk offset of the currently selected boot block
you are editing.  This number could be something different that zero when
you are editing extended partitions.  The list of commands and their
explanations are given below.
.Bl -tag -width "update"
.It Em help
This command gives you a list of commands that
.Nm
understands in the interactive edit mode.
.It Em reinit
This command initializes the currently selected, in memory copy, of the
boot block.
.It Em disk
This command will display the current drive geometry that fdisk has
probed.  You are given a chance to edit them if you wish.
.It Em edit
This command is used to edit a given table entry in the memory copy of
the current boot block.  You may edit either in BIOS geometry mode,
or in sector offsets and sizes.
.It Em flag
This command makes the given partition table entry bootable.  Only one
entry can be marked bootable. If you wish to boot from an extended
partition, you will need to mark the partition table entry for the
extended partition as bootable.
.It Em update
This command will update the machine code in the memory copy of the
currently selected boot block.
.It Em select
This command will select and load into memory the boot block pointed
to by the extended partition table entry in the current boot block.
.It Em print
This command will print the currently selected in memory copy of the boot
block and its MBR table to the terminal.
.It Em write
This will write the in memory copy of the boot block to disk.  You will
be asked to confirm this operation.
.It Em exit
This will exit the current level of fdisk, either returning to the
previously selected in memory copy of a boot block, or exit the
program if there is none.
.It Em quit
This will exit the current level of fdisk, either returning to the
previously selected in memory copy of a boot block, or exit the
program if there is none.  Unlike
.Em exit
it does write the modified block out.
.It Em abort
Quit program without saving current changes.
.El
.Pp
.Sh NOTES
The automatic calculation of starting cylinder etc. uses
a set of figures that represent what the BIOS thinks is the
geometry of the drive.
These figures are by default taken from the incore disklabel, or
values that
.Em /boot
has passed to the kernel, but
.Nm
gives you an opportunity to change them if there is a need to.
This allows the user to create a bootblock that can work with drives
that use geometry translation under a potentially different BIOS.
.Pp
If you hand craft your disk layout,
please make sure that the
.oS
partition starts on a cylinder boundary.
(This restriction may be changed in the future.)
.Pp
Editing an existing partition is risky, and may cause you to
lose all the data in that partition.
.Pp
You should run this program interactively once or twice to see how it works.
This is completely safe as long as you answer the write questions in the
negative.
.Sh FILES
.Pa /usr/mdec/mbr

.Xr boot_i386 8
.Sh BUGS
There are subtleties that the program detects that are not explained in
this manual page.  Also, chances are that some of the subleties it should
detect are being steamrolled.  Caveat Emperor.
