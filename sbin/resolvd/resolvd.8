.Sh NAME
.Nm resolvd
.Nd a daemon to handle nameserver configuration
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dv
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
handles the contents of
.Pa /etc/resolv.conf ,
which contains details of the system's DNS nameservers, and is
read by the resolver routines in the C library.
.Pp
.Nm
checks whether
.Xr unwind 8
is running and
monitors the routing socket for proposals sent by
.Xr dhclient 8 ,
.Xr slaacd 8 ,
or network devices which learn DNS information such as
.Xr umb 4 .
.Pp
If
.Xr unwind 8
is running it prepends the following to
.Pa /etc/resolv.conf :
.Pp
.Dl nameserver 127.0.0.1
.Pp
It also adds any other DNS proposals,
but commented out.
If
.Xr unwind 8
is not running it simply adds any other DNS proposals.
After that, it appends user-edited lines to the file.
.Pp
.Nm
keeps track of which parts it managed in the past and will only change those.
It will also create
.Pa /etc/resolv.conf
if it does not exist or if it is empty.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.

.Xr resolv.conf 5 ,
.Xr dhclient 8 ,
