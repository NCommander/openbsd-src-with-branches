.Dt PHOTURISD 1
.Os OpenBSD 2.1
.Sh NAME
.Nm photurisd
.Nd IPSec key management daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm photurisd
.Op Fl fi
.Op Fl d Ar directory
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm photuris
daemon establisches security associations for encrypted
and/or authenticated network traffic. 
.Pp
The daemon listens to a named pipe 
.Pa photuris.pipe
for user requests and on a
.Nm PF_ENCAP
socket for kernel requests.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
The
.Fl f
option is used to obmit the primality check of the bootstrapped moduli.
.It Fl i
The
.Fl i
option can be used to ignore the 
.Pa photuris.startup
file. Otherwise the exchanges in that file will be initiated
on startup.
.It Fl d
The
.Fl d
option specifies the directory in wich
.Nm photurisd
looks for its startup files. The default is
.Pa /etc/photuris/
.El
.Pp
The file
.Pa photuris.conf
contains the moduli for the DH exchange and the actual exchange
schemes used to establish a shared secret.
.Pp
The file
.Pa attributes.conf
contains the attributes, i.e. different choices of encryption
and authenication, offered to the other peer.
.Pp
The file
.Pa secrets.conf
contains the party preconfigured symmetric secrets for the
identity exchange. User secrets files can be included.
.Pp
Finally the file
.Pa photuris.startup
contains parameters for exchanges which are created during
startup.
.Pp
.Sh EXAMPLE
The keywords 
.Nm dst ,
.Nm port ,
.Nm options ,
.Nm tsrc ,
.Nm tdsr
and
.Nm user
are understood in the 
.Pa photuris.startup
file. The values are as follow:
.Bl -tag -width options -offser indent
.It dst
The destination IP address with which the exchange is to be established.
.It port
The port number of the destination
.Nm photuris
daemon.
.It options
The options to be used in the exchange. Possible values are
.Nm enc
and
.Nm auth .
.It tsrc
The source address with netmask from which packets are accepted
for the tunnel to be created.
.It tdst
The destination address with netmask for which packets are
accepted for the tunnel being created.
.It user
The user name for whom the keying shall be done. Preconfigured
secrets are taken from the users secret file.
.El
.Pp
Exchanges are separated by newlines.
.Pp
Example:
.Pp
	dst=134.100.106.2 port=468 options=auth
.Pp
	tsrc=134.100.104.0/255.255.255.255
.Pp
	tdst=134.100.106.0/255.255.255.255
