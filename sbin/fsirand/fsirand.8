.Op Fl f
.Op Fl p
.Ar special
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm fsirand
command installs random generation numbers on all the inodes in
the filesystem contained on

This increases the security of NFS-exported filesystems by making
it difficult to ``guess'' filehandles.

.Nm Fsirand
should only be used on an unmounted filesystem that
has been checked with
.Xr fsck 8
or a filesystem that is mounted read-only.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
The available options are as follows:
.It Fl f
Force
.Nm
to run even if the filesystem on
.Ar special
is not marked as clean.
.It Fl p
Print the current generation numbers for all inodes instead of
generating new ones.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fs 5 ,
.Xr fsck 8 ,
.Xr newfs 8 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in SunOS 3.x.
