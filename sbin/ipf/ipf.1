.TH IPF 1
.SH NAME
ipf - alters packet filtering lists for IP packet input and ouput
.SH SYNOPSIS
ipf [-AEDIsnovdr] [-F <i|o|a>] -f <\fIfilename\fP>
[ -f <\fIfilename\fP> [...]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBipf\fP opens the filenames listed (treating "-" as stdin) and parses the
file for a set of rules which are to be added or removed from the packet
filter rule set.
.PP
Each rule processed by \fBipf\fP
is added to the kernels internal lists if there are no parsing problems.
Rules are added to the end of the internal lists, matching the order in
which they appear when given to \fBipf\fP.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -A
set the list to make changes to the active list (default).
.IP -E
Enable the filter (if disabled).  Not effective for loadable kernel versions.
.IP -D
Disable the filter (if enabled).  Not effective for loadable kernel versions.
.IP -F
this option specifies which filter list to flush.  The parameter should
either be "i" (input), "o" (output) or "a" (remove all filter rules).
Either a single letter or an entire word starting with the appropriate
letter maybe used.  This option maybe before, or after, any other with
the order on the command line being that used to execute options.
.IP -d
turn debug mode on.  Causes a hexdump of filter rules to be generated as
it processes each one.
.IP -f
this option specifies which files
\fBipf\fP should use to get input from for modifying the pack filter rule
lists.
.IP -I
set the list to make changes to the inactive list.
.IP -n
This flag (no-change) prevents \fBipf\fP from actually making any ioctl
calls or doing anything which would alter the currently running kernel.
.IP -o
Force rules by default to be added/deleted to/from the output list, rather
than the (default) input list.
.IP -s
swap the active filter list in use to be the "other" one.
.IP -r
remove matching filter rules rather than add them to the internal lists
.IP -v
turn verbose mode on.  Displays information relating to rule processing.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
Needs to be run as root for the packet filtering lists to actually
be affected inside the kernel.
