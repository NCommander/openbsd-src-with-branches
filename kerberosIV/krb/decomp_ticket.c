/*
 * This routine takes a ticket and pointers to the variables that
 * should be filled in based on the information in the ticket.  It
 * fills in values for its arguments.
 *
 * Note: if the client realm field in the ticket is the null string,
 * then the "prealm" variable is filled in with the local realm.
 *
 * If the ticket byte order is different than the host's byte order
 * (as indicated by the byte order bit of the "flags" field), then
 * the KDC timestamp "time_sec" is byte-swapped.  The other fields
 * potentially affected by byte order, "paddress" and "session" are
 * not byte-swapped.
 *
 * The routine returns KFAILURE if any of the "pname", "pinstance",
 * or "prealm" fields is too big, otherwise it returns KSUCCESS.
 *
 * The corresponding routine to generate tickets is create_ticket.
 * When changes are made to this routine, the corresponding changes
 * should also be made to that file.
 *
 * See create_ticket.c for the format of the ticket packet.
