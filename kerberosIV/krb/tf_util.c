 * This file contains routines for manipulating the ticket cache file.
 *
 * The ticket file is in the following format:

 *      principal's instance    (null-terminated string)
 *      CREDENTIAL_1
 *      CREDENTIAL_2
 *      ...
 *      CREDENTIAL_n
 *      EOF
 *
 *      Where "CREDENTIAL_x" consists of the following fixed-length
 *      fields from the CREDENTIALS structure (see "krb.h"):
 *
 *              char            service[ANAME_SZ]
 *              char            instance[INST_SZ]

 *              u_int32_t            issue_date
 *
 * Short description of routines:
 *
 * tf_init() opens the ticket file and locks it.
 *
 * tf_get_pname() returns the principal's name.
 *
 * tf_get_pinst() returns the principal's instance (may be null).
 *
 * tf_get_cred() returns the next CREDENTIALS record.
 *
 * tf_save_cred() appends a new CREDENTIAL record to the ticket file.
 *
 * tf_close() closes the ticket file and releases the lock.
 *
 * tf_gets() returns the next null-terminated string.  It's an internal
 * routine used by tf_get_pname(), tf_get_pinst(), and tf_get_cred().
 *
 * tf_read() reads a given number of bytes.  It's an internal routine
 * used by tf_get_cred().
 */

/*
 * tf_init() should be called before the other ticket file routines.
 * It takes the name of the ticket file to use, "tf_name", and a

 *
 * It tries to open the ticket file, checks the mode, and if everything
 * is okay, locks the file.  If it's opened for reading, the lock is
 * shared.  If it's opened for writing, the lock is exclusive. 
 *
 * Returns KSUCCESS if all went well, otherwise one of the following:

 * NO_TKT_FIL   - file wasn't there
 * TKT_FIL_ACC  - file was in wrong mode, etc.
 * TKT_FIL_LCK  - couldn't lock the file, even after a retry
