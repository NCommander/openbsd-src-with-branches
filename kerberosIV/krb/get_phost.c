/*
 * This routine takes an alias for a host name and returns the first
 * field, lower case, of its domain name.  For example, if "menel" is
 * an alias for host officially named "menelaus" (in /etc/hosts), for
 * the host whose official name is "MENELAUS.MIT.EDU", the name "menelaus"
 * is returned.
 *
 * This is done for historical Athena reasons: the Kerberos name of
 * rcmd servers (rlogin, rsh, rcp) is of the form "rcmd.host@realm"
 * where "host"is the lowercase for of the host name ("menelaus").
 * This should go away: the instance should be the domain name
 * (MENELAUS.MIT.EDU).  But for now we need this routine...
 *
 * A pointer to the name is returned, if found, otherwise a pointer
 * to the original "alias" argument is returned.
