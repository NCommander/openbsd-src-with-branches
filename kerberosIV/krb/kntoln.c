 * krb_kntoln converts an auth name into a local name by looking up
 * the auth name in the /etc/aname file.  The format of the aname
 * file is:
 *
 * +-----+-----+-----+-----+------+----------+-------+-------+
 * | anl | inl | rll | lnl | name | instance | realm | lname |
 * +-----+-----+-----+-----+------+----------+-------+-------+
 * | 1by | 1by | 1by | 1by | name | instance | realm | lname |
 * +-----+-----+-----+-----+------+----------+-------+-------+
 *
 * If the /etc/aname file can not be opened it will set the
 * local name to the auth name.  Thus, in this case it performs as
 * the identity function.
 *
 * The name instance and realm are passed to krb_kntoln through
 * the AUTH_DAT structure (ad).
 *
 * Now here's what it *really* does:
 *
 * Given a Kerberos name in an AUTH_DAT structure, check that the
 * instance is null, and that the realm is the same as the local
 * realm, and return the principal's name in "lname".  Return
 * KSUCCESS if all goes well, otherwise KFAILURE.
