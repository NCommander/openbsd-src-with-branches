 * This routine creates a general purpose error reply message.  It
 * doesn't use KTEXT because application protocol may have long
 * messages, and may want this part of buffer contiguous to other

 *
 * The error reply is built in "p", using the error code "e" and
 * error text "e_string" given.  The length of the error reply is
 * returned.
 *
 * The error reply is in the following format:
 *
 * unsigned char	KRB_PROT_VERSION	protocol version no.
 * unsigned char	AUTH_MSG_APPL_ERR	message type
 * (least significant
 * bit of above)	HOST_BYTE_ORDER		local byte order
 * 4 bytes		e			given error code
 * string		e_string		given error text
