 * krb_mk_safe() constructs an AUTH_MSG_SAFE message.  It takes some
 * user data "in" of "length" bytes and creates a packet in "out"
 * consisting of the user data, a timestamp, and the sender's network
 * address, followed by a checksum computed on the above, using the
 * given "key".  The length of the resulting packet is returned.
 *
 * The "out" packet consists of:
 *
 * Size			Variable		Field
 * ----			--------		-----
 *
 * 1 byte		KRB_PROT_VERSION	protocol version number
 * 1 byte		AUTH_MSG_SAFE |		message type plus local
 *			HOST_BYTE_ORDER		byte order in low bit
 *
 * ===================== begin checksum ================================
 * 
 * 4 bytes		length			length of user data
 * length		in			user data
 * 1 byte		msg_time_5ms		timestamp milliseconds
 * 4 bytes		sender->sin.addr.s_addr	sender's IP address
 *
 * 4 bytes		msg_time_sec or		timestamp seconds with
 *			-msg_time_sec		direction in sign bit
 *
 * ======================= end checksum ================================
 *
 * 16 bytes		big_cksum		quadratic checksum of
 *						above using "key"
