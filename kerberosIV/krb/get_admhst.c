#include "krb_locl.h"

/*
 * Given a Kerberos realm, find a host on which the Kerberos database
 * administration server can be found.
 *
 * krb_get_admhst takes a pointer to be filled in, a pointer to the name
 * of the realm for which a server is desired, and an integer n, and
 * returns (in h) the nth administrative host entry from the configuration
 * file (KRB_CONF, defined in "krb.h") associated with the specified realm.
 *
 * On error, get_admhst returns KFAILURE. If all goes well, the routine
 * returns KSUCCESS.
 *
 * For the format of the KRB_CONF file, see comments describing the routine
 * krb_get_krbhst().
 *
 * This is a temporary hack to allow us to find the nearest system running
 * a Kerberos admin server.  In the long run, this functionality will be
 * provided by a nameserver.
