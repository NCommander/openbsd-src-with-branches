 * This source code is no longer held under any constraint of USA

 * USA State Department, who handed it to the Commerce department.  The
 * code was determined to fall under General License GTDA under ECCN 5D96G,
 * and hence exportable.  The cryptographic interfaces were re-added by Eric
 * Young, and then KTH proceeded to maintain the code in the free world.
