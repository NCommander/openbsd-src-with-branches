.Sh NAME
.Nm kpropd
.Nd network utility for Kerberos database propagation
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kpropd [-r realm] [-s srvtab] [-d database_file] [-l logfile]
.Nm [-p kdb_util_path] output_file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This daemon runs on a Kerberos slave and waits to receive the
Kerberos database propagated from a
.Nm kprop
process on a Kerberos master.
The first parameter,
.Nm output_file ,
that you must supply to the daemon is the name of a text file in which
data will be placed when it comes over the network.
.Pp
This utility executes the
.Nm kdb_util
utility, which loads the database
from the file specified in
.Nm output_file ,
puts it in
.Nm db(3)
format, and copies it into the Kerberos database in the directory
.Pa /etc/kerberosIV .
.Ss Parameters
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl r
Specifies the receiver realm for which data is accepted;
.Pa /etc/kerberosIV/krb.conf
specifies the default.
.It Fl s
Specifies the service table file from which to read the password
of the daemon, because a password cannot be entered manually when
running as a daemon.  The default is:
.Pa /etc/kerberosIV/srvtab .
.It Fl d
Specifies the primary Kerberos database file of a
Kerberos slave.
This file receives a new or updated
database propagated from the Kerberos master.
The default is the database
.Pa /etc/kerberosIV/principal.db .
.It Fl i
Run stand-alone.  If this flag is not given, it is assumed to have
been started by inetd.
.It Fl l
Specifies the name of the log file to be used.  The default is:
.Pa /var/log/kpropd.log .
.It Fl p
Specifies the full path (with directory and command) to the program
.Nm kdb_util .
The default is just:
.Nm kdb_util
which relies on the PATH environment variable to be searched to find it.
.It Fl P
Synonym for
.Nm -p .
.Sh BUGS
This utility does not support the transfer of encrypted data.
.Pp
If the
.Nm -P
or 
.Nm -p
options are not specified and the PATH environment variable does not
contain the directory with
.Nm kdb_util ,
this program will fail.
