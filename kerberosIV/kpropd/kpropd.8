.SH NAME
kpropd \- network utility for Kerberos database propagation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kpropd [-r realm] [-s srvtab] [-d database_file] [-l logfile] [-p kdb_util_path] output_file
.SH DESCRIPTION
This daemon runs on a Kerberos slave and waits to receive the
Kerberos database propagated from a
.I kprop
process on a Kerberos master.
The first parameter,
.BR output_file ,
that you must supply to the daemon is the name of a text file in which
data will be placed when it comes over the network.

This utility executes the
.I kdb_util
utility, which loads the database
from the file specified in
.BR output_file ,
puts it in
.I db(3)
format, and copies it into the Kerberos database in the directory
.IR /etc/kerberosIV .
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 7
.B \-r
Specifies the reciever realm for which data is accepted;
.I /etc/krb.conf
specifies the default.
.TP
.B \-s
Specifies the service table file from which to read the password
of the daemon, because a password cannot be entered manually when
running as a daemon.  The default is:
.IR /etc/kerberosIV/srvtab .
.TP
.B \-d
Specifies the primary Kerberos database file of a
Kerberos slave.
This file receives a new or updated
database propagated from the Kerberos master.
The default is the database in the directory
.IR /etc/kerberosIV ,
The file is:
.IR principal.db .
.TP
.B \-l
Specifies the name of the log file to be used.  The default is:
.IR /var/log/kpropd.log .
.TP
.B \-p
Specificies the full path (with directory and command) to the program
.IR kdb_util .
The default is just:
.I kdb_util
which relies on the PATH environment variable to be searched to find it.
.TP
.B \-P
Synonym for
.BR \-p .
.SH BUGS
This utility does not support the transfer of encrypted data.

If the
.B \-P
or 
.B \-p
options are not specified and the PATH environment variable does not
contain the directory with
.IR kdb_util ,
this program will fail.
