Release apon comp.sources.misc
Version 3.01 08/10/93
	Added des_3cbc_encrypt()

Version 3.00 07/10/93
	Fixed up documentation.
	quad_cksum definitly compatable with MIT's now.

Version 2.30 24/08/93
	Tripple DES now defaults to tripple cbc but can do tripple ecb
	 with the -b flag.
	Fixed some MSDOS uuen/uudecoding problems, thanks to
	Added prototypes.
	
Version 2.22 29/06/93
	Fixed a bug in des_is_weak_key() which stopped it working :-(
	thanks to engineering@MorningStar.Com.

Version 2.21 03/06/93
	des(1) with no arguments gives quite a bit of help.
	Added -c (generate ckecksum) flag to des(1).
	Added -3 (tripple DES) flag to des(1).
	Added cfb and ofb routines to the library.

Version 2.20 11/03/93
	Added -u (uuencode) flag to des(1).
	I have been playing with byte order in quad_cksum to make it
	 compatible with MIT's version.  All I can say is aviod this
	 function if possible since MIT's output is endian dependent.

Version 2.12 14/10/92
	Added MSDOS specific macro in ecb_encrypt which gives a %70
	 speed up when the code is compiled with turbo C.

Version 2.11 12/10/92
	Speedup in set_key (recoding of PC-1)
	 I now do it in 47 simple operations, down from 60.
	 Thanks to John Fletcher (john_fletcher@lccmail.ocf.llnl.gov)
	 for motivating me to look for a faster system :-)
	 The speedup is probably less that 1% but it is still 13
	 instructions less :-).

Version 2.10 06/10/92
	The code now works on the 64bit ETA10 and CRAY without modifications or
	 #defines.  I believe the code should work on any machine that
	 defines long, int or short to be 8 bytes long.
	Thanks to Shabbir J. Safdar (shabby@mentor.cc.purdue.edu)
	 for helping me fix the code to run on 64bit machines (he had
	 access to an ETA10).
	Thanks also to John Fletcher <john_fletcher@lccmail.ocf.llnl.gov>
	 for testing the routines on a CRAY.
	read_password.c has been renamed to read_passwd.c
	string_to_key.c has been renamed to string2key.c

Version 2.00 14/09/92
	Made mods so that the library should work on 64bit CPU's.
	Removed all my uchar and ulong defs.  To many different
	 versions of unix define them in their header files in too many
	 different combinations :-)
	IRIX - Sillicon Graphics mods (mostly in read_password.c).
	 Thanks to Andrew Daviel (advax@erich.triumf.ca)

Version 1.99 26/08/92
	Fixed a bug or 2 in enc_read.c
	Fixed a bug in enc_write.c
	Fixed a pseudo bug in fcrypt.c (very obscure).

Version 1.98 31/07/92
	Support for the ETA10.  This is a strange machine that defines
	longs and ints as 8 bytes and shorts as 4 bytes.
	Since I do evil things with long * that assume that they are 4
	bytes.  Look in the Makefile for the option to compile for
	this machine.  quad_cksum appears to have problems but I
	will don't have the time to fix it right now, and this is not
	a function that uses DES and so will not effect the main uses
	of the library.

Version 1.97 20/05/92 eay
	Fixed the Imakefile and made some changes to des.h to fix some
	problems when building this package with Kerberos v 4.

Version 1.96 18/05/92 eay
	Fixed a small bug in string_to_key() where problems could
	occur if des_check_key was set to true and the string
	generated a weak key.

Patch2 posted to comp.sources.misc
Version 1.95 13/05/92 eay
	Added an alternative version of the D_ENCRYPT macro in
	ecb_encrypt and fcrypt.  Depending on the compiler, one version or the
	other will be faster.  This was inspired by 
	Dana How <how@isl.stanford.edu>, and her pointers about doing the
	*(ulong *)((uchar *)ptr+(value&0xfc))
	vs
	ptr[value&0x3f]
	to stop the C compiler doing a <<2 to convert the long array index.

Version 1.94 05/05/92 eay
	Fixed an incompatibility between my string_to_key and the MIT
	 version.  When the key is longer than 8 chars, I was wrapping
	 with a different method.  To use the old version, define
	 OLD_STR_TO_KEY in the makefile.  Thanks to
	 viktor@newsu.shearson.com (Viktor Dukhovni).

Version 1.93 28/04/92 eay
	Fixed the VMS mods so that echo is now turned off in
	 read_password.  Thanks again to brennan@coco.cchs.su.oz.AU.
	MSDOS support added.  The routines can be compiled with
	 Turbo C (v2.0) and MSC (v5.1).  Make sure MSDOS is defined.

Patch1 posted to comp.sources.misc
Version 1.92 13/04/92 eay
	Changed D_ENCRYPT so that the rotation of R occurs outside of
	 the loop.  This required rotating all the longs in sp.h (now
	 called spr.h). Thanks to Richard Outerbridge <71755.204@CompuServe.COM>
	speed.c has been changed so it will work without SIGALRM.  If
	 times(3) is not present it will try to use ftime() instead.

Version 1.91 08/04/92 eay
	Added -E/-D options to des(1) so it can use string_to_key.
	Added SVR4 mods suggested by witr@rwwa.COM
	Added VMS mods suggested by brennan@coco.cchs.su.oz.AU.  If
	anyone knows how to turn of tty echo in VMS please tell me or
	implement it yourself :-).
	Changed FILE *IN/*OUT to *DES_IN/*DES_OUT since it appears VMS
	does not like IN/OUT being used.

Libdes posted to comp.sources.misc
Version 1.9 24/03/92 eay
	Now contains a fast small crypt replacement.
	Added des(1) command.
	Added des_rw_mode so people can use cbc encryption with
	enc_read and enc_write.

Version 1.8 15/10/91 eay
	Bug in cbc_cksum.
	Many thanks to Keith Reynolds (keithr@sco.COM) for pointing this
	one out.

Version 1.7 24/09/91 eay
	Fixed set_key :-)
	set_key is 4 times faster and takes less space.
	There are a few minor changes that could be made.

Version 1.6 19/09/1991 eay
	Finally go IP and FP finished.
	Now I need to fix set_key.
	This version is quite a bit faster that 1.51

Version 1.52 15/06/1991 eay
	20% speedup in ecb_encrypt by changing the E bit selection
	to use 2 32bit words.  This also required modification of the
	sp table.  There is still a way to speedup the IP and IP-1
	(hints from outer@sq.com) still working on this one :-(.

Version 1.51 07/06/1991 eay
	Faster des_encrypt by loop unrolling
	Fixed bug in quad_cksum.c (thanks to hughes@logos.ucs.indiana.edu)

Version 1.50 28/05/1991 eay
	Optimized the code a bit more for the sparc.  I have improved the
	speed of the inner des_encrypt by speeding up the initial and
	final permutations.

Version 1.40 23/10/1990 eay
	Fixed des_random_key, it did not produce a random key :-(

Version 1.30  2/10/1990 eay
	Have made des_quad_cksum the same as MIT's, the full package
	should be compatible with MIT's
	Have tested on a DECstation 3100
	Still need to fix des_set_key (make it faster).
	Does des_cbc_encrypts at 70.5k/sec on a 3100.

Version 1.20 18/09/1990 eay
	Fixed byte order dependencies.
	Fixed (I hope) all the word alignment problems.
	Speedup in des_ecb_encrypt.

Version 1.10 11/09/1990 eay
	Added des_enc_read and des_enc_write.
	Still need to fix des_quad_cksum.
	Still need to document des_enc_read and des_enc_write.

Version 1.00 27/08/1990 eay
