.Sh NAME
.Nm krb.realms
.Nd host to Kerberos realm translation file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
provides a translation from a hostname to the Kerberos realm name for
the services provided by that host.
.Pp
Each line of the translation file is in one of the following forms
.Pf ( Fa domain_name
should be of the form .XXX.YYY, e.g. .LCS.MIT.EDU):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
host_name kerberos_realm
domain_name kerberos_realm
.Ed
.Pp
If a hostname exactly matches the
.Fa host_name
field in a line of the first form, the corresponding
.Fa kerberos_realm
is the realm of the host.  If a hostname does not match any
.Fa host_name
in the file, but its domain exactly matches the
.Fa domain_name
field in a line of the second form, the corresponding
.Fa kerberos_realm
is the realm of the host.
.Pp
If no translation entry applies, the host's realm is considered to be
the hostname's domain portion converted to upper case.
