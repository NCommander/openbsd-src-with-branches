# Simple example how you can missuse kip to provide "mobile-ip".
# This is since there is no way to tunnel ip over udp or any other
# protocol. There is also problems to get thru firewalls and NATs
# with mobile-ip since (today) they usully doesn't support IPIP or
# GRE.
#
# All commands are for linux (redhat6.1) but it should be quite 
# simple to fix it to support other OS.
