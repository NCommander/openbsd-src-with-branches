.Os KTH-KRB
.Sh NAME
/etc/krb.conf \- Kerberos configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pa krb.conf
contains configuration information describing the Kerberos realm(s) and the
Kerberos key distribution center (KDC) servers for known realms.
.PP
.Pa krb.conf
starts with a definition of the local realm on the first line, this is
followed by any number lines defining supplementary local realms.  The
rest of the file consists of lines indicating realm/host entries. The
first token is a realm name, and the second is a server specification
of a host running a KDC for that realm. The words "admin server"
following the hostname indicate that the host also provides an
administrative database server.

To be able to communicate with the KDC through a firewall it is
sometimes necessary to tunnel requests over HTTP or TCP. Tunnel
protocols and port numbers are specified in the server specification
using the syntax [(UDP|TCP|HTTP)/]hostname[:port].
