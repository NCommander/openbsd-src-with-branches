.SH NAME
ksrvutil \- host kerberos keyfile (srvtab) manipulation utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
ksrvutil
.B operation
[
.B \-k 
] [ 
.B \-i 
] [ 
.B \-f filename 
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I ksrvutil
allows a system manager to list or change keys currently in his
keyfile or to add new keys to the keyfile.
.PP

Operation must be one of the following:
.TP 10n
.I list
lists the keys in a keyfile showing version number and principal
name.  If the \-k option is given, keys will also be shown.
.TP 10n
.I change
changes all the keys in the keyfile by using the regular admin
protocol.  If the \-i flag is given, 
.I ksrvutil
will prompt for yes or no before changing each key.  If the \-k
option is used, the old and new keys will be displayed.
.TP 10n
.I add
allows the user to add a key.
.I add
prompts for name, instance, realm, and key version number, asks
for confirmation, and then asks for a password.  
.I ksrvutil 
then converts the password to a key and appends the keyfile with
the new information.  If the \-k option is used, the key is
displayed. 

.PP
In all cases, the default file used is KEY_FILE as defined in
krb.h unless this is overridden by the \-f option.

.PP
A good use for
.I ksrvutil
would be for adding keys to a keyfile.  A system manager could
ask a kerberos administrator to create a new service key with 
.IR kadmin (8)
and could supply an initial password.  Then, he could use 
.I ksrvutil
to add the key to the keyfile and then to change the key so that
it will be random and unknown to either the system manager or
the kerberos administrator.

.I ksrvutil
always makes a backup copy of the keyfile before making any
changes.  

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If 
.I ksrvutil
should exit on an error condition at any time during a change or
add, a copy of the
original keyfile can be found in 
.IR filename .old
where 
.I filename
is the name of the keyfile, and a copy of the file with all new
keys changed or added so far can be found in 
.IR filename .work.
The original keyfile is left unmodified until the program exits
at which point it is removed and replaced it with the workfile.
Appending the workfile to the backup copy and replacing the
keyfile with the result should always give a usable keyfile,
although the resulting keyfile will have some out of date keys
in it.
