This program is designed to help you upgrade your OpenBSD system in a
simple and rational way.

As a reminder, installing the `etc' binary set is NOT recommended.
Once the rest of your system has been upgraded, you should manually
merge any changes to files in the `etc' set into those files which
already exist on your system.

As with anything which modifies your disk's contents, this program can
cause SIGNIFICANT data loss, and you are advised to make sure your
data is backed up before beginning the installation process.

Default answers are displayed in brackets after the questions.  You
can hit Control-C at any time to quit, but if you do so at a prompt,
you may have to hit return.  Also, quitting in the middle of
installation may leave your system in an inconsistent state.

installed system, enter halt at the command prompt.  Once the system has
halted, reset the machine and boot from the disk.
