You will now be asked if you want to initialize $_disk with a 1MB MSDOS
partition. This is the recommended setup and will allow you to store the boot
and other interesting things here.

If you want to have a different setup, exit 'install' now and do the MBR
initialization by hand using the 'fdisk' program.

If you choose to manually setup the MSDOS partition, consult your PowerPC
OpenFirmware manual -and- the PowerPC OpenBSD Installation Guide for doing
setup this way.

An MBR record with an OpenBSD usable partition table will now be copied to your
disk. Unless you have special requirements, you will not need to edit this MBR.
After the MBR is copied an empty 1MB MSDOS partition will be created on the
disk. You *MUST* setup the OpenBSD disklabel to have a partition include this
MSDOS partition. You will have an opportunity to do this shortly.

You will probably see a few '...: no disk label' messages. It's completely
normal. The disk has no label yet. This may take a minute or two...

Apple systems have two methods to label/partition a boot disk.

Either the disk can be partitioned with Apple HFS partition tools to contain an
"Unused" partition, or without any MacOS tools, the disk can be labeled using
an MBR partition table.

If the HFS (DPME) partition table is used, after the disk is partitioned with
the Apple software, the "Unused" section must be changed to type "OpenBSD" name
"OpenBSD" using the pdisk tool contained on this ramdisk. The disklabel can
then be edited normally.

WARNING: the MBR partitioning code will HAPPILY overwrite/destroy any HFS
	 partitions on the disk, including the partition table. Choose the
         MBR option carefully, knowing this fact.

You may keep your current setup if you want to be able to use any already

later. There must also be at least ~0.5MB free space in the boot partition to
hold the OpenBSD bootloader.

Also note that the boot partition must be included as partition 'i' in the
OpenBSD disklabel.

This disk has not previously been used with OpenBSD. You may share this disk
with other operating systems. However, to be able to boot the system you will
need a small DOS partition in the beginning of the disk to hold the kernel
boot. OpenFirmware understands how to read an MSDOS style format from the disk.

This DOS style partitioning has been taken care of if you chose to do that
initialization earlier in the install.

WARNING: Wrong information in the BIOS partition table might render the disk
         unusable.

An OpenBSD partition should have a type (id) of 166 (A6), and should be the
only partition marked as active. Also make sure that the size of the partition
to be used by OpenBSD is correct, otherwise OpenBSD disklabel installation will
fail. Furthermore, the partitions must NOT overlap each others.

The fdisk utility will be started update mode (interactive.) You will be able
to add / modify this information as needed. If you make a mistake, simply exit
fdisk without storing the new information, and you will be allowed to start
over.

Disk partition sizes and offsets are in sector (most likely 512 bytes) units.
You may set these size/offset pairs on cylinder boundaries
     (the number of sector per cylinder is given in )
     (the 'sectors/cylinder' entry, which is not shown here)
Also, you *must* make sure that the 'i' partition points at the MSDOS partition
that will be used for booting. The 'c' partition shall start at offset 0 and
include the entire disk. This is most likely correct when you see the default
label in the editor.

Do not change any parameters except the partition layout and the label name.

   [Here is an example of what the partition information may look like.]
10 partitions:
