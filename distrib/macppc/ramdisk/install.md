**** NOTE ****

A valid MBR for an OpenBSD bootable disk must contain at least:

a) One DOS (id '06') partition at least 1MB in size. This is where Open
Firmware will look for the 'ofwboot' program used to boot OpenBSD.
Consult your PowerPC Open Firmware manual -and- the INSTALL.$ARCH file
for directions on setting up this partition correctly.

b) One OpenBSD (id 'A6') partition.

**************

Current partition information is:

$(fdisk $_disk)

__EOT

	fdisk -e $_disk

	cat <<__EOT
Here is the MBR configuration you chose:

$(fdisk $_disk)

Please take note of the offsets and sizes of the DOS partition, the OpenBSD
partition, and any other partitions you want to access from OpenBSD. You will
need this information to fill in the OpenBSD disklabel.

__EOT

You must modify an existing partition to be of type "OpenBSD" and have the name
"OpenBSD". If the partition does not exist you must create it with the Apple
MacOS tools before attempting to install OpenBSD.

You *MUST* setup the OpenBSD disklabel to include the MSDOS-formatted boot
partition as the 'i' partition. If the 'i' partition is missing or not the
MSDOS-formatted boot partition, then the 'ofwboot' file required to boot
OpenBSD cannot be installed.

To boot OpenBSD, the 'ofwboot' program must be present in the first HFS
partition of $ROOTDISK. If it is not currently present you must boot MacOS and
use MacOS tools to copy it from the OpenBSD install media. Then reboot the
machine.
__EOT
	fi

	cat <<__EOT

Once the machine has rebooted use Open Firmware to boot into OpenBSD, as
described in the INSTALL.$ARCH document. The command to boot OpenBSD will
be something like 'boot hd:,ofwboot /bsd'.
