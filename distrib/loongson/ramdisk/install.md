You will now create one MBR partition to contain your OpenBSD data
and one MBR partition to contain the program that PMON uses
to boot OpenBSD. Neither partition will overlap any other partition.

The OpenBSD MBR partition will have an id of 'A6' and the boot MBR
partition will have an id of '83' (Linux files). The boot partition will be
at least 1MB and be the first 'Linux files' partition on the disk.
The installer assumes there is already an ext2 or ext3 filesystem on the
first 'Linux files' partition.

You will now create an OpenBSD disklabel inside the OpenBSD MBR
partition. The disklabel defines how OpenBSD splits up the MBR partition
into OpenBSD partitions in which filesystems and swap space are created.
You must provide each filesystem's mountpoint in this program.

The offsets used in the disklabel are ABSOLUTE, i.e. relative to the
start of the disk, NOT the start of the OpenBSD MBR partition.

Once the machine has rebooted use PMON to boot into OpenBSD, as
described in the INSTALL.$ARCH document.
To load the OpenBSD bootloader, use 'boot /dev/fs/ext2@wd0/boot/boot',
where wd0 is the PMON name of the boot disk.
