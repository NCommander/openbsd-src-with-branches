MBR partition tables are created with OpenBSD. MacOS *cannot* be booted from a
disk partitioned with an MBR partition table.

You *MUST* setup the OpenBSD disklabel to include the MSDOS-formatted boot
partition as the 'i' partition. If the 'i' partition is missing or not the
MSDOS-formatted boot partition, then the 'ofwboot' file required to boot
OpenBSD cannot be installed.

Once the machine has rebooted use OpenFirmware to boot into OpenBSD, as
described in the INSTALL.$ARCH document. The command to boot OpenBSD will be
something like 'boot (hd0)bsd'.
