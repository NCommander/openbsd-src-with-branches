This program is designed to help you upgrade your OpenBSD system in a
simple and rational way.

As a reminder, installing the `etc' binary set is NOT recommended.
Once the rest of your system has been upgraded, you should manually
merge any changes to files in the `etc' set into those files which
already exist on your system.

As with anything which modifies your disk's contents, this
program can cause SIGNIFICANT data loss, and you are advised
to make sure your data is backed up before beginning the
installation process.

Default answers are displayed in brackets after the questions.
You can hit Control-C at any time to quit, but if you do so at a
prompt, you may have to hit return.  Also, quitting in the middle of
installation may leave your system in an inconsistent state.

OK, then.  Enter `halt' at the prompt to halt the machine.  Once the
machine has halted, power-cycle the system and you'll get back to AmigaOS.

CONGRATULATIONS!  You have successfully $what OpenBSD!
To boot the installed system, enter halt at the command prompt. Once the
system has halted, reset the machine, enter AmigaOS and boot via loadbsd
without the -b flag, per the install document.
