An OpenBSD partition should have type 166 (A6), and should be the only
partition marked as active.  Furthermore, the partitions must NOT
overlap each others.  fdisk will be started in update mode, and you
will be able to add this information as needed.  If you make a mistake,
exit fdisk without storing the new information, and you will be allowed
to start over.

Here is an example of what the partition information will look like once
you have entered the disklabel editor. Disk partition sizes and offsets
are in sector (most likely 512 bytes) units. You may set these size/offset
pairs on cylinder boundaries (the number of sector per cylinder is given
in the `sectors/cylinder' entry, which is not shown here). Although this
is not requiered. 

Also, you *must* make sure that the 'd' partition points at the MSDOS
partition that will be used for booting. The 'c' partition shall start
at offset 0 and include the entire disk. This is most likely correct when
you see the default label in the editor.


Do not change any parameters except the partition layout and the label name.

[Example]
10 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize   cpg]
  a:   120832    10240    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl.   11*- 142*)

  c:  6265200        0    unused     1024  8192         # (Cyl.    0 - 6809)
  d:    10208       32     MSDOS                        # (Cyl.    0*- 11*)

This program is designed to help you put OpenBSD on your disk,
in a simple and rational way.  You'll be asked several questions,
and it would probably be useful to have your disk's hardware
manual, the installation notes, and a calculator handy.

This program is designed to help you upgrade your OpenBSD system in a
simple and rational way.

As a reminder, installing the `etc' binary set is NOT recommended.
Once the rest of your system has been upgraded, you should manually
merge any changes to files in the `etc' set into those files which
already exist on your system.

As with anything which modifies your disk's contents, this
program can cause SIGNIFICANT data loss, and you are advised
to make sure your data is backed up before beginning the
installation process.

Default answers are displayed in brackets after the questions.
You can hit Control-C at any time to quit, but if you do so at a
prompt, you may have to hit return.  Also, quitting in the middle of
installation may leave your system in an inconsistent state.
