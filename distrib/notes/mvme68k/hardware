OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on the following classes of machines:
	- MVME147 - Motorola with 68030 and 68881
	- MVME162 - Motorola with 68040
	- MVME167 - Motorola with 68040
	- MVME172 - Motorola with 68060
	- MVME177 - Motorola with 68060

The minimal configuration requires 8M of RAM and ~60M of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to 
compile the system, more RAM is recommended (OpenBSD with 8M of
RAM feels like Solaris with 8M of RAM). Note that until you have
around 16M of RAM, getting more RAM is more important than getting a
faster CPU board).

Supported devices {:-include-:}:

MVME147:
	serial ports: 
		on-board ttya-ttyd
	ethernet:
		on-board AMD 7990 Lance ethernet ("le0")
	SCSI:
		on-board WD33C93 controller
	parallel:
		a driver exists, but it is not integrated.
	VMEbus:
		not supported (some cards have issues)

MVME162, MVME172:
	serial ports:
		on-board tty00-03 - Zilog Z85230 SCC
	ethernet:
		on-board Intel 82596CA ethernet ("ie0")
	SCSI:
		on-board NCR53c710 controller
	VME:
		drivers for short I/O access
	Flash:
		1 MB flash, either Intel 28F008SA or 28F020
		driver is available, but doesn't work
		Jumper GPIO3 selects Flash memory map and must
		be installed for booting with the Flash driver (default)
	SRAM:
		supported
	VMEbus:
		untested
	IP:
		untested

MVME167, MVME177:
	serial:
		on-board tty00 - tty03 - Cirrus Logic CD2401
	ethernet: 
		on-board Intel 82596CA ethernet ("ie0")
	SCSI: 
		on-board NCR53c710 controller
	parallel:
		not supported
	SRAM:
		supported
	VMEbus:
		supported
		

Faithful clones of the above boards should also work.

Additional VMEbus devices {:-include-:}:

	MVME328 SCSI controller ("vs")

	MVME376 VME bus ethernet ("le*")
