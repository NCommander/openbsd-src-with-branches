OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on the following classes of machines:
	- MVME147 - Motorola with 68030 and 68881
	- MVME162 - Motorola with 68040 and IndustryPack slots
	- MVME165 - Motorola with 68040 and VSB interface
	- MVME167 - Motorola with 68040
dnl 172 support is not tested
	- MVME172 - Motorola with 68060 and IndustryPack slots
	- MVME177 - Motorola with 68060

The minimal configuration requires 12MB of RAM and ~160MB of disk space. To
install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to compile the
system, more RAM is recommended.  Note that until you have 32MB of RAM,
getting more RAM is more important than getting a faster CPU board.

Supported devices {:-include-:}:

MVME147:
	serial ports:
		on-board ttya-ttyd (zs)
	Ethernet:
		on-board AMD 7990 Lance Ethernet (le)
	SCSI:
		on-board WD33C93 controller (wdsc)
	VMEbus:
		partially supported (some cards have issues)

MVME165:
	serial ports:
		on-board ttyd0 - ttyd1 - MC68681 (dart)
	VMEbus:
		supported

MVME162, MVME172:
	serial ports:
		on-board ttya-ttyd - Zilog Z85230 SCC (zs)
	Ethernet:
		on-board Intel 82596CA Ethernet (ie)
	SCSI:
		on-board NCR53c710 controller (osiop)
	VMEbus:
		drivers for short I/O access (untested)
	Flash:
		1MB flash, either Intel 28F008SA or 28F020
		A driver is available, but doesn't work correctly.
		Jumper GPIO3 selects Flash memory map and must
		be installed for booting with the Flash driver (default)
	SRAM:
		supported
	IndustryPack:
		untested

MVME167, MVME177:
	serial ports:
		on-board tty00 - tty03 - Cirrus Logic CD2401 (cl)
	Ethernet:
		on-board Intel 82596CA Ethernet (ie)
	SCSI:
		on-board NCR53c710 controller (osiop)
	SRAM:
		supported
	VMEbus:
		supported
		
Faithful clones of the above boards should also work.

Additional VMEbus devices:

	MVME327A SCSI and floppy Controller (vsbic), currently limited
	    to the SCSI interface only
	MVME328 High Performance SCSI Controller (vs)
dnl	MVME332XT High Performance Serial I/O Controller (vx)
	MVME376 Ethernet Communications Controller (le)
