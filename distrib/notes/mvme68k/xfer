Installation is supported from several media types, including:

	FFS partitions
	Tape
	Remote NFS partitions
	CD-ROM
	FTP
	HTTP

The steps necessary to prepare the distribution sets for installation
depend on which method of installation you choose.  The various methods
are explained below.

The variety of options listed may seem confusing, but situations vary
widely in terms of what peripherals and what sort of network arrangements
a user has, the intent is to provide some way that will be practical.


The steps necessary to prepare the distribution sets for installation
depend on which method of installation you choose.  Some methods
require a bit of setup first that is explained below.


To install or upgrade OpenBSD using a tape, you need to do the following:

	To install OpenBSD from a tape, you need to make a tape that
	contains the distribution set files, each in "tar" format or
	in "gzipped tar format".  First you will need to transfer the
	distribution sets to your local system, using ftp or by mounting
	the CD-ROM containing the release.  Then you need to make a tape
	containing the files.

	If you're making the tape on a UN*X-like system, the easiest way
	to do so is make a shell script along the following lines, call it
	"/tmp/maketape".

	#! /bin/sh
	tape=/dev/nrst0
	mt -f ${tape} rewind
	if test $# -lt 1
	then
		dd if=stboot of=${tape} obs=512
		dd if=bootst of=${tape} obs=512
		dd if=bsd.rd of=${tape} obs=8k conv=sync
	fi
	for file in base etc comp game man misc xbase xfont xshare
	do
		dd if=${file}OSrev.tgz of=${tape} obs=8k conv=sync
	done
	tar cf ${tape} bsd
	mt -f ${tape} offline
	# end of script


	And then:

	cd .../OSREV/MACHINE
	sh -x /tmp/maketape

	
	Note that this script creates a bootable tape. If you only want to
	fetch the OpenBSD files from tape, but want to boot from another
	device, you can save time and space creating the tape this way:

	cd .../OSREV/MACHINE
	sh -x /tmp/maketape noboot

	
	If you're using a system other than OpenBSD or SunOS, the tape
	name and other requirements may change.


To install OpenBSD using a remote partition, mounted via
NFS, you must do the following:

	NOTE:	This method of installation is recommended only for
		those already familiar with using BSD network
		configuration and management commands.  If you aren't,
		this documentation should help, but is not intended to
		be all-encompassing.

	Place the OpenBSD distribution sets you wish to install into a
	directory on an NFS server, and make that directory mountable
	by the machine on which you are installing or upgrading OpenBSD.
	This will probably require modifying the /etc/exports file on
	of the NFS server and resetting its mount daemon (mountd).
	(Both of these actions will probably require superuser
	privileges on the server.)

	You need to know the numeric IP address of the NFS server,
	and, if the server is not on a network directly connected to
	the machine on which you're installing or upgrading OpenBSD,
	you need to know the numeric IP address of the router closest
	to the OpenBSD machine.  Finally, you need to know the numeric
	IP address of the OpenBSD machine itself.

	Once the NFS server is set up properly and you have the
	information mentioned above, you can proceed to the next step
	in the installation or upgrade process.  If you're installing
	OpenBSD from scratch, go to the section on preparing your hard
	disk, below.  If you're upgrading an existing installation, go
	directly to the section on upgrading.

If you are upgrading OpenBSD, you also have the option of installing
OpenBSD by putting the new distribution sets somewhere in your existing
file system, and using them from there.  To do that, you must do the
following:

	Place the distribution sets you wish to upgrade somewhere in
	your current file system tree.  At a bare minimum, you must
	upgrade the "base" binary distribution, and so must put the
	"base{:--:}OSrev" set somewhere in your file system.  If you wish,
	you can do the other sets, as well, but you should NOT upgrade
	the "etc" distribution; the "etc" distribution contains system
	configuration files that you should review and update by hand.

	Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next step in
	the upgrade process, actually upgrading your system.
