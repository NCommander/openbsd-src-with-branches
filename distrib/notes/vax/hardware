OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on the following classes of machines
(machines in parentheses have been tested):
	- KA410-based 	(VAXstation/MicroVAX 2000)
 	- KA42(0)-based (VAXstation 3100/{30,40})
	- some KA670 vaxen 	(VAX 4000/300)
	- some KA640 vaxen	(MicroVAX 3300/3400)

Ethernet devices:
	- on-board MicroVAX or VAXstation LANCE 
	- DEC SGEC 

SCSI:
	- on-board NCR 5380 (VS3100)
	
Serial ports:
	- DZ*11 qbus lines (also DZ*11 compatible lines on VAXstations)

The lowest amount of memory tested is 6M; however, more is recommeded.
At the moment, the only supported console is a serial console; this will
change soon.

Currently, your only storage options for using OpenBSD/MACHINE are SCSI 
disks or tapes on the VAXstation 3100's NCR5380 controller, which is 
supported, or a NFS root and swap.  Please see below for details.
