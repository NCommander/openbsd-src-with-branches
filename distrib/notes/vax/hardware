OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on a wide variety of VAX hardware.
The following systems have been tested:
	- VAXstation 2000
	- VAXstation 3100/{30,40}
	- VAXstation 3100/{38,48}
	- VAXstation 3100/76
	- VAXstation 4000/60
	- VAXstation 4000/VLC
	- MicroVAX 2000
	- MicroVAX 3100/{10,20}{,e}
	- MicroVAX 3100/80
	- MicroVAX 3100/90
	- MicroVAX 3300
	- VAX 4000/10{0,5}
	- VAX 4000/300
	- VAX 4000/{4,5,6}00{,A}

Ethernet devices:
	- on-board MicroVAX or VAXstation LANCE 
	- DEC SGEC 

SCSI:
	- NCR 5380 or NCR 53C9x on-board SCSI is generally supported
	- Includes most 3100's and VAXstation 4000's, as well as the
	  VAX 4000 10X series.
	
Serial ports:
	- DZ*11 lines (also DZ*11 compatible lines on VAXstations)

The lowest amount of memory tested is 6M; however, more is recommended.
At the moment, the only supported console is a serial console.

Currently, your only storage options for using OpenBSD/MACHINE are SCSI 
disks or tapes on one of the supported controllers, or a NFS root and 
swap.  Please see below for details.
