OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on a wide variety of VAX hardware.
The following systems have been tested:
	- VAXstation 2000
	- VAXstation 3100/{30,40}
	- VAXstation 3100/{38,48}
	- VAXstation 3100/76
	- VAXstation 4000/VLC
	- VAXstation 4000/60
	- VAXstation 4000/90
	- MicroVAX 2000
	- MicroVAX 3100/{10,20}{,e}
	- MicroVAX 3100/80
	- MicroVAX 3100/85
	- MicroVAX 3100/90
	- MicroVAX 3300
	- VAX 4000 10{0,5}
	- VAX 4000 200
	- VAX 4000 300
	- VAX 4000 {4,5,6}00
	- VAX 4000 {5,7}00A

Ethernet devices:
	- on-board MicroVAX or VAXstation LANCE
	- DEC SGEC

SCSI:
	- NCR 5380 or NCR 53C9x on-board SCSI is generally supported
	- Includes most 3100's and VAXstation 4000's, as well as the
	  VAX 4000 10X series.
	
QBUS:
	- KFQSA       (MSCP DSSI controller)
	- Emulex UC08 (MSCP SCSI controller)
	- CXY08       (DHV-11 emulating serial)
	- DELQA       (Ethernet)

Serial ports:
	- DZ*11 lines (also DZ*11 compatible lines on VAXstations)

The lowest amount of memory tested is 6M; however, more is recommended.
At the moment, the only supported console is a serial console.

Currently, your storage options for using OpenBSD/MACHINE are SCSI disks
or tapes on one of the supported controllers, disks and tapes accessed
through an appropriate QBUS MSCP controller, or an NFS root and swap.
Please see below for details.
