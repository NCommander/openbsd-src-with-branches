OpenBSD/vax OSREV is a port to the VAX series of machines manufactured
by Digital (now Compaq).

This port is still fairly recent, and for this reason it is still quite
"rough", although stability has greatly improved since the previous
release.

Development is ongoing, and support for a greater variety of hardware
as well as new features is in the works.
