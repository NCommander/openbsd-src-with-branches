OpenBSD/vax OSREV is a port to the VAX series of machines, formerly
manufactured by Digital Equipment Corporation.

This port is still fairly recent, and for this reason it is still quite
"rough", although many areas are greatly improved since the previous
release.

Development is ongoing, and support for a greater variety of hardware
as well as new features is in the works.
