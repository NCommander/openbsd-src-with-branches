OpenBSDInstallPrelude

At the moment, the only way to install OpenBSD/vax is via diskless 
booting over an Ethernet network.  You will need both the "boot.mop" 
image and the "bsd.rd" kernel to boot.  You will also need a machine 
configured as a rarp, MOP, bootparam, and NFS server.  

This document will give a few examples on how to set up each of these 
services on an OpenBSD machine; if this is not enough information, 
check out the OpenBSD manpages for rarpd(8), mopd(8), rpc.bootparamd(8), 
bootparams(5), nfsd(8), mountd(8), and diskless(8).  Also, Brian Chase 
<bdc@world.std.com> has written a guide for booting a VAX off of a 
network; this was written for NetBSD/vax, but the procedure is virtually 
identical for OpenBSD/vax, and the document covers the use of several 
different platforms as servers.

The guide is available at:
http://world.std.com/~bdc/projects/vaxen/VAX-netboot-HOWTO

If this is your first time installing over a network it is STRONGLY
suggested you read this guide.

Configuring the Server:
---------------------

When you turn on your VAX, it will run a set of self-diagnostic ROM routines.
Depending on the model of VAX you have, it may take quite a while.  When 
it is done, you will see a >>> prompt (also called the chevron prompt) on the
console.  Typing "show dev" or "show ethernet" to get the VAX ethernet 
device's MAC address usually works; also try "TEST 50" on MicroVAXen 2000
and 3100.

You will need to create an /etc/ethers file.  This file is used by rarpd to 
answer rarp (ethernet address->IP address) requests.  The format of this file 
is the ethernet address followed by the machine name or address.  Here is an 
example:

08:00:2b:24:72:00		quickvax

Then start rarpd (or configure /etc/rc.conf to always start rarpd).

Copy boot.mop into /tftpboot/mop/1a2b3c4d5e6f.SYS, where "1a2b3c4d5e6f"
represents the six octets of your ethernet address.  For example, the 
filename for the machine described above would be "08002b247200.SYS".
Note that all non alphanumeric characters must be stripped and the
mac portion must be lower case, the extension upper.
Start mopd by typing "mopd -a".

rpc.bootparamd's configuration file is /etc/bootparams.  The format for this
file is described in the diskless(8) and bootparams(5) manpages.  Enable
rpc.bootparamd in /etc/rc.conf by changing the value of "bootparamd_flags". 
Also, make sure "portmap" is "YES"; you will need portmap running.  

nfsd and mountd configuration are described in their respective manual pages.
Make a separate directory for your VAX's /, make sure it is exported via NFS, 
and place "bsd.rd" there.

Typing "B <DEVICE>", where <DEVICE> is your VAX's ethernet device, at the 
chevron prompt should then load the OpenBSD booter.  A countdown should begin;
type any key on the console and type "boot bsd.rd".
