By default MACHINE systems are shipped with a Linux installation on the
CompactFlash card or USB drive. At the moment the only way to install OpenBSD
is by using TFTP to load bsd.rd.

First connect your computer via serial port to the device (you may need to use
a Cisco serial cable depending on your hardware) with a command such as
"tip -115200 tty00" (assuming tty00 is your serial port device). Now apply
power to the device and start it.

Unless you have removed or changed the Linux installation it will be booted
automatically. If you are quick you can interrupt booting (while still in
U-Boot) with ^C.
