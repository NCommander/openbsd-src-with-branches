The following machines are targeted by OpenBSD/MACHINE:

	Portwell CAM-0100
	  onboard serial port, CompactFlash and Ethernet are supported;
	  it's possible to install OpenBSD/MACHINE on this machine with
	  some effort.

	Ubiquiti Networks EdgeRouter Lite
	  at the moment little hardware is supported by OpenBSD/MACHINE
	  on this machine. There is no USB support yet, which means that
	  there is no storage (no onboard CompactFlash), and Ethernet
	  isn't supported either.

Currently no USB devices are supported on OpenBSD/MACHINE.
