The following machines are targeted by OpenBSD/MACHINE:

	Portwell CAM-0100
	  onboard serial port, CompactFlash and Ethernet are supported;
	  it's possible to install OpenBSD/MACHINE on this machine with
	  some effort.

	Ubiquiti Networks EdgeRouter Lite
	  onboard serial port and Ethernet are supported; it's possible
	  to boot OpenBSD/MACHINE on this machine over NFS. There is no
	  USB support yet, which means that there is no local storage
	  (no onboard CompactFlash).

	D-Link DSR-500
	  onboard serial port and Ethernet are supported; it's possible
	  to boot OpenBSD/MACHINE on this machine over NFS. The onboard
	  CompactFlash is not yet supported which, together with the
	  lack of USB support, means that there is no local storage
	  available at the moment for this model.
