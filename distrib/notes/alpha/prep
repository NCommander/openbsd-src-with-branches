OpenBSD/alpha requires the SRM console.  Some alphas come with
the ARC firmware instead (this is what Windows NT uses).  It is
fairly simple to replace the ARC firmware with the SRM version.
You can get replacement firmware either from a firmware update
CD or via ftp from ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/.

AXPPCI33 Motherboard notes:
    The 1994 version of the OEM guide has an incorrect pinout
    for the serial ports.  The newer version from
    ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/Digital/axppci/design_guide.ps.Z
    has a corrected pinout (as well as more information than
    the 1994 edition).  Note that there are two flavors
    of PC serial connectors.  If you have the wrong kind,
    you won't get any output from the serial console.

Acquiring and updating firmware:
    As of May, 1997, the latest firmware version available for
    ftp is version 3.9.  To update an alpha with an axppci33
    motherboard from ARC firmware to SRM one would ftp to
    ftp.digital.com and download
	/pub/DEC/Alpha/firmware/v3.9/decaxppci33/decaxppci33_v1_6.exe
    then copy it to a FAT-formatted (ie: DOS) floppy with the name
    FWUPDATE.EXE.  Now that you have your new firmware on a floppy
    you just need to insert it into your machine's floppy drive and
    turn on the machine.  To actually update the firmware you need to
    choose the "Supplementary menu" from the ARC console and then
    "Install new firmware".  After fwupdate.exe is done loading from
    the floppy, enter "update srm" at the prompt and hit return.
    After the update is complete you may want to verify the update
    (if this was not done automatically) by entering "verify srm" at
    the prompt.  Once this is done you can enter "exit" and cycle power
    on your machine.  When it reboots you should be in the SRM console.

    Note that the procedure for updating SRM firmware from an
    existing version of the SRM console is different.  Please see
    the README files that come with the firmware update for details.

Using the SRM console:
    This is not intended to be an exhaustive guide on using the
    SRM firmware console.  It should, however, give you enough
    information to boot OpenBSD/alpha.

    To see a list of devices connected to your alpha, you can
    use the "show device" command.  For booting the devices you
    are interested in are "dva0" (the floppy drive) and
    "dka*" (the disk drives).

    You can set ROM variables by saying "set VARIABLE VALUE".
    Some variables you will want to set:
	auto_action	Determines what happens when you turn power
			on, halt, or crash your machine.  Valid
			values {:-include-:} "halt", "boot", and "restart".
			Most users will want to set this to "boot".
	bootdef_dev	Default boot device (or list of devices).
	boot_file	Name of the kernel to boot.  If you don't set
			this "bsd" will be loaded.
	boot_osflags	Flags to pass in to the kernel.  For multiuser
			boot this needs to be set to "-a".
	booted_osflags	Don't try to set this one directly.  It will
			contain whatever flags the OS was last booted
			with.  To set indirectly, boot with the -flags
			option, eg: "b dka0 -flags a" will boot into
			multi-user and set booted_osflags to "a".
    To see a list of all variables on your machine use the "show"
    command with no arguments.


On systems with no framebuffer supported, including all
TurboChannel-based machines, OpenBSD/Alpha *must* be used with a
serial console.  Setting an Alpha system to use a serial console
is system-specific.  The procedure for most common hardware is:

	DEC 3000/[4-9]00's:
		Flip the appropriate switch on the back of the machine.

	DEC 3000/300 family machines:
		Boot the machine with the keyboard/mouse connector
		unplugged.

	AlphaStations, AXPpci systems and most others:
		Get to the SRM console prompt.  Enter "set console serial",
		then enter "init" or cycle power.

See your owner's manual for more details on how to set your machine
to use a serial console.
