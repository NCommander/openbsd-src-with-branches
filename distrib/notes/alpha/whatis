OpenBSD/alpha OSREV is a port to Alpha processor-based machines,
such as some workstations manufactured by Digital (now Compaq), as well
as OEM motherboards designed by Alpha Processor, Inc.

This port is undergoing a lot of changes to improve stability and
hardware coverage, although this release should be pretty usable.
