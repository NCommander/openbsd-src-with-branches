Installation is supported from several media types, including:

	FFS partitions
	Tape
	Remote NFS partition
	CD-ROM
	FTP
	HTTP

If you have the OpenBSD CD-ROM distribution (and a CD-ROM drive)
you can boot from it.  Otherwise, you will need to create a bootable
disk.  This may be a floppy or a hard disk (floppy is simplest).

To boot from CD-ROM:

	At the SRM console enter "show device" to find the name of your
	CD-ROM drive (should be pka*), then insert the OpenBSD/alpha CD
	and enter "boot DEVICE" where DEVICE is the pka device.  If this
	does not work, you'll have to create a boot floppy or bootable
	hard disk; follow the directions below.  (A boot floppy image
	is included on the CD-ROM as 2.1/alpha/floppy.fs.)

If you have a floppy drive on your alpha:

	If you are using a UN*X-like system to write the floppy image to
	disk, you should use the "dd" command to copy the file system image
	(floppy.fs) directly to the raw floppy disk.  It is suggested
	that you read the dd(1) manual page or ask your system administrator
	to determine the correct set of arguments to use; it will be slightly
	different from system to system, and a comprehensive list of the
	possibilities is beyond the scope of this document.

	If you are using a DOS PC to write the floppy image to disk, you
	should use the "rawrite" utility, provided in the "i386/inst"
	directory of the OpenBSD distribution.  It will write the file
	system image (floppy.fs) to a disk.

	Note that, when installing, the floppy can be write-protected (i.e.
	read-only).

If you don't have a floppy drive on your alpha:

	If you don't have a floppy drive you can copy the floppy image
	onto the hard disk you intend to install OpenBSD on.  Doing so
	will overwrite the disk's old contents, however.

	You must use a UN*X-like system to write the floppy image to the
	hard disk you will be using for OpenBSD/alpha.  You should use the
	"dd" command to copy the file system image (floppy.fs) directly
	to the raw 'c' device (whole disk) of the target hard disk.  It
	is suggested that you read the dd(1) manual page or ask your system
	administrator to determine the correct set of arguments to use;
	it will be slightly different from system to system, and a
	comprehensive list of the possibilities is beyond the scope of
	this document.

	Please note that this will put a floppy disklabel on your
	disk which will confuse the install script.  To fix this
	you need to answer "n" to the first question when booting
	your disk and do "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rsd0c count=20"
	assuming your booted from sd0.  After doing this you
	will not be able to boot that disk again unless you
	complete the install.  You can now enter "install" and
	start the actual install process.

The steps necessary to prepare the distribution sets for installation
depend on which method of installation you choose.  Some methods
require a bit of setup first that is explained below.

To install or upgrade OpenBSD using a tape, you need to do the
following:

	To install OpenBSD from a tape, you need to make a tape that
	contains the distribution set files, in "tar" format.  If
	you're making the tape on a UN*X-like system, the easiest way
	to do so is probably something like:

		tar cf <tape_device> <dist_directories>

	where "<tape_device>" is the name of the tape device that
	describes the tape drive you're using (possibly /dev/rst0, or
	something similar, but it will vary from system to system.
	(If you can't figure it out, ask your system administrator.)
	In the above example, "<dist_directories>" are the
	distribution sets' directories, for the distribution sets you
	wish to place on the tape.  For instance, to put the "base21"
	and "etc21" distributions on tape (in order to do the absolute
	minimum installation to a new disk), you would do the
	following:

		cd .../2.1		# the top of the tree
		cd alpha/
		tar cf <tape_device> base21 etc21

	(Note that you still need to fill in "<tape_device>" in the
	example.)

	Once you have the files on the tape, you can proceed to the
	next step in the installation or upgrade process.  If you're
	installing OpenBSD from scratch, go to the section on preparing
	your hard disk, below.  If you're upgrading an existing
	installation, go directly to the section on upgrading.

To install OpenBSD using a remote partition, mounted via
NFS, you must do the following:

	NOTE:	This method of installation is recommended only for
		those already familiar with using BSD network
		configuration and management commands.  If you aren't,
		this documentation should help, but is not intended to
		be all-encompassing.

	Place the OpenBSD distribution sets you wish to install into a
	directory on an NFS server, and make that directory mountable
	by the machine on which you are installing or upgrading OpenBSD.
	This will probably require modifying the /etc/exports file on
	of the NFS server and resetting its mount daemon (mountd).
	(Both of these actions will probably require superuser
	privileges on the server.)

	You need to know the the numeric IP address of the NFS server,
	and, if the server is not on a network directly connected to
	the machine on which you're installing or upgrading OpenBSD,
	you need to know the numeric IP address of the router closest
	to the OpenBSD machine.  Finally, you need to know the numeric
	IP address of the OpenBSD machine itself.

	Once the NFS server is set up properly and you have the
	information mentioned above, you can proceed to the next step
	in the installation or upgrade process.  If you're installing
	OpenBSD from scratch, go to the section on preparing your hard
	disk, below.  If you're upgrading an existing installation, go
	directly to the section on upgrading.

If you are upgrading OpenBSD, you also have the option of installing
OpenBSD by putting the new distribution sets somewhere in your existing
file system, and using them from there.  To do that, you must do the
following:

	Place the distribution sets you wish to upgrade somewhere in
	your current file system tree.  At a bare minimum, you must
	upgrade the "base" binary distribution, and so must put the
	"base21" set somewhere in your file system.  If you wish,
	you can do the other sets, as well, but you should NOT upgrade
	the "etc" distribution; the "etc" distribution contains system
	configuration files that you should review and update by hand.

	Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next step in
	the upgrade process, actually upgrading your system.
