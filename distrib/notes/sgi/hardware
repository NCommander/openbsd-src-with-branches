OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on the following machines:
	O2 with the following CPU configurations:
		R5000, R52xx and RM7000 with any secondary/tertiary caches.
		R10000 and R12000 with secondary caches.

	On O2's with R10000 CPUs the Speculative Dirty problem is not
	handled in any special way. However, so far, we have not seen
	any problems from this behaviour.
