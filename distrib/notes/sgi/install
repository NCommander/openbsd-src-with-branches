There are several ways to install OpenBSD onto a disk. The easiest way
in terms of preliminary setup is to use the OpenBSD ramdisk kernel that
can be booted via BOOTP. The normal way is to use the bootable CD-ROM
mini image.

Booting over the network:
dnl XXX provide more details!!!

First, a bootp or dhcpd server needs to be set up. The bootpd(8) or
dhcpd(8) manual page on your server should provide detailed information
on how to set up the server.

The bootp or dhcp server needs to know the ethernet address of the
system. This address can be found by using the ``printenv'' command
in the Maintenance Console, looking for the ``eaddr'' variable.

The server should also provide a tftp location, where the bsd.rd file
should be available.

Once the server is set up, boot with the following command in the
Maintenance Console:

> bootp()/bsd.rd

Booting from CD-ROM installation media:

From the System Maintenance Menu, select '2' (or click on the
appropriate icon if in graphics console) to Install System Software.

If necessary, select the proper CD-ROM drive, and press enter to
confirm your choice.  Insert the installation CD-ROM (if you did not
do so already) and press enter to boot the system.

If the boot is successful, you will get a loader version message,
executable sizes, and then the kernel copyright and device probe
messages.  Boot failure modes are typically a lot of CD-ROM drive
activity, but no messages or complaints about magic numbers,
checksums or formats.

Installing the system:

OpenBSDInstallPart2

	Boot your machine from the installation media as described above.

	It will take a while to load the kernel especially from a slow
	network connection, most likely more than a minute.  If some action
	doesn't eventually happen, or the spinning cursor has stopped and
	nothing further has happened, either your boot media is bad, your
	diskless setup isn't correct, or you may have a hardware or
	configuration problem.

	You will next be asked for your terminal type.
dnl XXX needs extra text here once graphics console is available
	Just hit return to select the default (vt100).

	No partitions should overlap with the SGI Volume Header, which by
	default will use the first 3134 sectors. Additionally, the 'a'
	partition must be the first partition on the disk, immediately
	following the SGI Volume Header. If the default Volume Header size is
	used, the 'a' partition should be located at offset 3135. If the 'a'
	partition is not located immediately after the Volume Header the boot
	loader will not be able to locate and load the kernel.
