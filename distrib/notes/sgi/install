There are several ways to install OpenBSD onto a disk. The easiest way
in terms of preliminary setup is to use the OpenBSD ramdisk kernel that
can be booted via BOOTP. Booting from CD is not yet supported.

Booting over the network:
dnl XXX provide more details!!!

First, a bootp or dhcpd server needs to be set up. The bootpd(8) or
dhcpd(8) manual page on your server should provide detailed information
on how to set up the server.

The bootp or dhcp server needs to know the ethernet address of the
system. This address can be found by using the ``printenv'' command
in the Maintenance Console, looking for the ``eaddr'' variable.

The server should also provide a tftp location, where the bsd.rd file
should be available.

Once the server is set up, boot with the following command in the
Maintenance Console:

> boot bootp()/bsd.rd


Installing the system:

OpenBSDInstallPart2

	Boot your machine from the installation media as described above.

	It will take a while to load the kernel especially from a slow
	network connection, most likely more than a minute.  If some action
	doesn't eventually happen, or the spinning cursor has stopped and
	nothing further has happened, either your boot media is bad, your
	diskless setup isn't correct, or you may have a hardware or
	configuration problem.

OpenBSDBootMsgs

	You will next be asked for your terminal type.
dnl XXX needs extra text here once graphics console is available
	Just hit return to select the default (vt100).
