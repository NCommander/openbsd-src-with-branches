Before you start you should familiarize yourself with the ARCS setup
and how to run programs from the Command monitor prompt.

If you're installing OpenBSD/sgi for the first time it's a very good
idea to look at the partition sizes of disk you intend installing OpenBSD on.
Changing the size of partitions after you've installed is difficult. If
you do not have a spare bootable disk, it may be simpler to re-install
OpenBSD again from scratch.

Assuming a classic partition scheme with root (`/') and /usr filesystems,
a comfortable size for the OpenBSD root filesystem partition (a) is about
64Mb. The install will take ~30Mb of that. However it has shown that 256M
is not a bad choice when more packages are to be installed. A good initial
size for the swap (b) partition is twice the amount of physical memory in
your machine or at least 128M. A minimum /usr partition (e) is ~256M but
with that you will likely run into trouble later. A minimum size of 1G is
recommended. A full binary installation, without X11 or any other additional
software, takes about 170M in `/usr'.
