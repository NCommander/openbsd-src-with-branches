To be able to boot the OpenBSD/MACHINE installation program, you will
need to acquire some limited knowledge of ABLE Firmware, the low-level
process that controls the microprocessor after hardware initialization
and diagnostics are performed but before control is handed to the
operating system.

A complete documentation on the ABLE firmware is available from Simtec at
the following URL:
  http://www.simtec.co.uk/products/SWABLE/files/able-doc-allset/

For convenience, a few ABLE commands are described below:

boot (hd0)bsd
	boot the ELF file 'bsd' from the disk partition identified
	by firmware as hd0.

nvset variable value
	sets a firmware environment variable.

nvsave
	saves all variable changes to non-volatile memory.

nvclear
	restores environment variables defaults.

The following environment variables control the system startup:

boot.auto
	when set to "true" (which is its default value), the system will
	attempt to execute the command set in the "boot.cmd" variable
	after "boot.timeout" seconds.
boot.cmd
	command used to auto-boot, such as "boot (hd0)bsd" to boot the
	bsd kernel from the first hard disk drive.
boot.timeout
	delay until the system boots, in seconds
