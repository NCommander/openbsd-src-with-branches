As complete as your OpenBSD system is, you may want to add any of several
excellent third party software applications.  There are several ways to do
this.  You can:

1) Obtain the source code and build the application based
   upon whatever installation procedures are provided with the
   application.

2) Use the OpenBSD ``ports'' collection to automatically get any
   needed source file, apply any required patches, create the
   application, and install it for you.

3) Use the OpenBSD ``package'' collection to grab a pre-compiled
   and tested version of the application for your hardware.

If you purchased the OpenBSD CD-ROM you already have several popular
``packages'', and the ``ports'' collection.

Instructions for installing applications from the various sources using
the different installation methods follow.  If emacs is to be installed
it should be installed first as it creates the ``info'' directory file
that may be modified by other applications.

You should also refer to the packages(7) manual page.

Installing applications from the CD-ROM package collection:

	The OpenBSD CD-ROM ships with several applications pre-built
	for various hardware architectures.  The number of applications
	vary according to available disk space.  Check the directory
	OSREV/packages/MACHINE to see which packages are available for
	your hardware architecture.  That directory will be on the same
	CD-ROM containing the OS installation files for your architecture.

	To install one or more of these packages you must
	1) become the superuser (root)
	2) mount the appropriage CD-ROM
	3) use the ``pkg_add'' command to install the software

	Example (in which we use su(1) to get superuser privileges, thus
	you have to be in group "wheel", see the manual page for su(1)).

    $ su
    Password: <enter your root password>
    # mkdir -p /cdrom
    # mount /dev/cd0a /cdrom
    {:-#-:} pkg_add /cdrom/OSREV/packages/MACHINE/<package-name>
    # <add more packages if desired>
    # umount /cdrom
	
	Package names are usually the application name and version
	with .tgz appended, e.g. emacs-20.3.tgz

Installing applications from the ftp.openbsd.org package collection:

	All available packages for your architecture have been placed on
	ftp.openbsd.org in the directory pub/OpenBSD/OSREV/packages/MACHINE/
	You may want to peruse this to see what packages are available.  The
	packages are also on the OpenBSD FTP mirror sites.  See

		http://www.openbsd.org/ftp.html

	for a list of current ftp mirror sites.

	Installation of a package is very easy.
	1) become the superuser (root)
	2) use the ``pkg_add'' command to install the software

	``pkg_add'' is smart enough to know how to download the software
	from the OpenBSD ftp server.  Example:

    $ su
    Password: <enter your root password>
    {:-#-:} pkg_add ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/{:--:}OSREV/packages/MACHINE/emacs-20.3.tgz

	ftp.

Installing applications from the CD-ROM ports collection:

	The CD-ROM ``ports'' collection is a set of Makefiles, patches,
	and other files used to control the building and installation
	of an application from source files.  

	Creating an application from sources can require a lot of
	disk space, sometimes 50 megabytes or more.  The first step is
	to determine which of your disks has enough room.  Once you've
	made this determination read the file README.ports on CD-ROM 2
	to see how to copy or mount the ports directory.

	To build an application you must:

	1) become the superuser (root)
	2) have network access, or obtain the actual source files by
	   some other means.
	3) cd to the ports directory containing the port you wish
	   to build.  To build samba, for example, where you'd
	   previously copied the ports files into the /usr/ports
	   directory: cd /usr/ports/net/samba
	4) make
	5) make install
	6) make clean

Installing applications from the OpenBSD ports collection:

	See http://www.openbsd.org/ports.html for current instructions
	on obtaining and installing OpenBSD ports.

	You should also refer to the ports(7) manual page.

Installing other applications:

	If an OpenBSD package or port does not exist for an application
	you're pretty much on your own.  The first thing to do is ask
	ports@openbsd.org if anyone is working on a port -- there may
	be one in progress.  If no luck there you may try the FreeBSD
	ports or NetBSD package collection.  If you are on an i386 based
	machine it is quite possible that the FreeBSD port, if one exists,
	will work for you.

	If you can't find an existing port try to make your own and
	feed it back to OpenBSD.  That's how our ports collection grows.
	Some details can be found at http://www.openbsd.org/porting.html
	with more help coming from the mailing list, ports@openbsd.org.
