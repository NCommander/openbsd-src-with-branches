As complete as your OpenBSD system you still may want to add any of
several excellent third party software application.  There are several
ways to do this.  You can

1) Obtaining the source code and building the application based
   upon whatever installation procedures are provided with the
   application.

2) Use the OpenBSD ``ports'' collection to automatically get any
   needed source file, apply any required patches, create the
   application, and install it for you.

3) Use the OpenBSD ``package'' collection to grab a pre-compiled
   and tested version of the application for your hardware.

If you purchased the OpenBSD CD-ROM you already have several popular
``packages'', the ``ports'' collection, and most of the ``ports''
source file releases.

Instructions for installing applications from various sources using
the various methods follow.  If emacs is to be installed it should
be installed first as it creates the ``info'' directory file that
may be modified by other applications.

Installing applications from the the CD-ROM package collection:

	The OpenBSD CD-ROM ships with applications pre-built
	for various hardware architectures.  The applications
	and supported architectures are:

			i386	sparc	m68k	alpha	mips
	emacs-20.2	yes	yes	yes	yes	no
	bash-2.01.1	yes	yes	yes	yes	no
	tcsh-6.07.02	yes	yes	yes	yes	no
	pine-3.96	yes	yes	yes	yes	no

	To install one or more of these packages you must
	1) become the superuser (root)
	2) mount CD-ROM number 2
	3) use the ``pkg_add'' command to install the software

	Example:

    $ su
    Password: <enter your root password>
    # mkdir -p /cdrom
    # mount /dev/cd0a /cdrom
    # pkg_add /cdrom/packages/<arch>/<package-name>
    # <add more packages if desired>
    # umount /cdrom
	
	Your hardware architecture can be determined by issing
	the command ``arch''.  The response will be something like
	``OpenBSD.sparc''.  ``sparc'' is the architecture.

	Package names are usually the application name and version
	with .tgz appended, e.g. pine-3.96.tgz

Installing applications from the ftp.openbsd.org package collection:

	The above packages, and others, have been placed on
	ftp.openbsd.org in the directory pub/OpenBSD/2.3/packages/<arch>/
	where <arch> is the supported hardware architecture.  You may
	want to peruse the directory for your architecture to see what
	packages are available.

	Installation of a package is very easy.
	1) become the superuser (root)
	2) use the ``pkg_add'' command to install the software

	``pkg_add'' is smart enough to know how to download the software
	from the OpenBSD ftp server.  Example:

    $ su
    Password: <enter your root password>
    # pkg_add ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.3/packages/i386/emacs-20.2.tgz

	Note: there are both USA and INTERNATIONAL versoins of ssh and
	pgp on the ftp server.  Be sure to grab the correct version.
	The USA versions, ssh-usa-1.2.22.tgz and pgp-usa-2.6.3.tgz, use
	RSAREF, a legal requirement for use within the United States.

Installing applications from the CD-ROM ports collection:

	The CD-ROM ``ports'' collection is a set of Makefiles, patches,
	and other files used to control the building and installation
	of an application from source files.  The source files come
	from archives which are also, for the most part, on the
	OpenBSD CD-ROM.

Installing other applications:

	If an OpenBSD package or port does not exist for an application
	you're pretty much on your own.  The first thing to do is ask
	ports@openbsd.org if anyone is working on a port -- there may
	be one in progress.  If no luck there you may try the FreeBSD
	ports collection.  If you are on an i386 based machine it is
	quite possible that the FreeBSD port, if one exists, will work
	for you,

	If you can't find an existing port try to make your own and
	feed it back to OpenBSD.  That's how our ports collection grows.
	Some details can be found at http://www.openbsd.org/porting.html
	with more help coming from the mailing list, ports@openbsd.org.
