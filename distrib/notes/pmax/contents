		simpleroot*	pmax boot and installation
				simpleroot files; see below.

There is a pmax simpleroot image named simpleroot{:--:}OSrev.fs (it is usually
compressed using gzip - simpleroot{:--:}OSrev.fs.gz - so you need gunzip first
to uncompress it) subdirectory of the OpenBSD OSREV distribution.  This
file you can dump onto a disk and boot from it to start the installation
of OpenBSD/pmax. Also there is a simpleroot{:--:}OSrev.tar.gz file there.  It
can be used as root area on the NFS server if you plan to install via
network.
