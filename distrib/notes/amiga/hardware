OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on any amiga that has a 68020, 68030, 68040 or
68060 CPU with some form of FPU and MMU.  It should also run on
MacroSystem's DraCo computer.  The minimal configuration requires 4M of
RAM and about 55M of disk space.  To install the entire system requires
much more disk space, and to run X or compile the system, more RAM is
recommended.  (4M of RAM will actually allow you to compile, however it
won't be speedy.  X really isn't usable on a 4M system.)

Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
	partition:	advise,	with X,	needed,	with X
	root (/)	 30M	 30M	25M	 25M
	user (/usr)	210M    245M   140M     175M
	/usr/local      depends on what extra software you want
	swap		---- 1MB for every MB RAM ----
			-- but the sum of swap and ---
			- RAM should be at least 16 --

As you may note the recommended size of /usr is 70M greater than
needed. This is to leave room for a kernel source and compile tree
as you will probably want to compile your own kernel. (GENERIC is
large and bulky to accommodate all people).

Starting with OpenBSD 2.7, you should be able to leave /usr mounted ro
on production machines, and use a separate /usr/local partition for
packages.


If you only have 4M of fast memory, you should make your swap partition
larger, as your system will be doing much more swapping.
