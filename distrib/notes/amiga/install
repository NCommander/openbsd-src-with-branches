	If you have a small machine (less than 6MB of fast RAM) you'll
	have to setup a miniroot filesystem in the swap partition, as
	described in the "Preparing your System for OpenBSD Installation"
	section above.  If your machine has 6MB or more we strongly
	recommend using the ramdisk kernel instead.  This way you don't
	need to setup any root image beforehand.

	You need to have the "loadbsd" program in your command path.
	If AmigaDOS complains about loadbsd not being an executable file,
	be sure that the "Execute" protection bit is set.  If not, set it
	with the command:
		Protect loadbsd add e

	Next you need to get yourself into OpenBSD by loading the
	kernel from AmigaDOS with loadbsd like so:

		loadbsd bsd.rd

	or, if you are doing a miniroot install:

		loadbsd -b bsd


	If you have an AGA machine, and your monitor will handle
	the dblNTSC mode, you may also {:-include-:} the "-A" option to
	enable the dblNTSC display mode.

	If you are doing the miniroot install you will be prompted for a
	root device.  The name of your root disk is typically "sd0" for
	SCSI drives or the A4000 IDE drives or "wd0" for ISA-connected IDE
	drives.  Reply with the name of your disk, such as "sd0*", where
	"0" is the device which holds the miniroot-containing swap
	partition you created during the hard disk preparation.  If the
	system should hang after entering the root device, try again with

		loadbsd -I ff -b bsd

	This disables synchronous transfer on all SCSI devices.  For
	ramdisk installations this kind of hang might occur later during
	the install when accessing the SCSI disk for the first time.  If
	such a hang occurs, try again with:

		loadbsd -I ff bsd.rd

	You will be asked which terminal type to use, you should just
	hit return to select the default (vt220).

	The install program will then tell you which disks of that
	type it can install on, and ask you which it should use.  Reply
	with the name of your disk ("sd0" or "wd0").

	The install program will now ask which file systems should be
	created on which partitions.  It will automatically select the
	'a' partition to be the root file system. Next it will ask for
	which disk and partition you want a file system created on.
	This will be the same as the disk name (e.g. "sd0") with the
	letter identifying the partition (e.g. "d") appended (e.g.
	"sd0d").  Then it will ask where this partition is to be
	mounted, e.g. /usr.  This process will be repeated until you
	just hit return.

	At this point you will be asked to confirm that the file system
	information you have entered is correct, and given an opportunity
	to change the file system table.  Next it will create the new file
	systems as specified, OVERWRITING ANY EXISTING DATA.  This is the
	point of no return.

	The install program will now make the filesystems you specified.
	There should be only one error in this section of the installation.
	It will look like this:

		newfs: ioctl (WDINFO): Invalid argument
		newfs: /dev/rsd0a: can't rewrite disk label

	If there are any others, restart from the beginning of
	the installation process.  This error is ok as the Amiga
	does not write disklabels currently.  You should expect
	this error whenever using newfs.

OpenBSDInstallNet(linkflags)dnl
 The flags usually carry the following
	meaning:

		-link0 -link1	Use BNC (coaxial) port [default]
		link0 -link1	Use AUI port
		link0 link1	Use UTP (twisted pair) port
