Installation/upgrade miniroot file system:

	This file contains a BSD root file system setup to help
	you install or upgrade the rest of OpenBSD.  This includes
	formatting root and /usr partitions in the case of an install
	or converting existing ones if doing an upgrade (this conversion
	is only needed if you are coming from a real old NetBSD world),
	then mounting your root and /usr partitions and getting
	ready to extract (and possibly first fetching) the distribution
	sets.  There is enough on this file system to allow you to
	make a slip or ppp connection, configure an Ethernet, mount an
	NFS file system or ftp.  You can also load distribution sets from
	a SCSI tape or from one of your existing AmigaDOS partitions.

	This file is named "miniroot{:--:}OSrev.fs".
