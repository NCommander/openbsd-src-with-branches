Installation is supported from several media types, including:

	CD-ROM
	FFS partitions
	AmigaDOS Fast file system partitions
	Tape
	Remote NFS partition
	FTP
	HTTP

However, whichever method you choose, you need to transfer a OpenBSD
kernel binary to your AmigaDOS partition.  Optionally you must also get
the miniroot image there for later transfer to your swap partition as
explained earlier.
For ramdisk installs you need to get both the bsd and bsd.rd
kernel images, and for miniroot installs you need bsd and the
miniroot{:--:}OSrev.fs image.

To prepare for installing via an AmigaDOS partition:

	To install OpenBSD from an AmigaDOS partition, you need to
	get the OpenBSD distribution sets you wish to install
	on your system on to an AmigaDOS fast file system partition.
	All of the set_name{:--:}OSrev.tgz pieces can be placed in a single
	directory instead of separate ones for each distribution set.
	This will also simplify the installation work later on.

	Note where you place the files, you will need this later.
	Also, it might be a good idea to type down the AmigaDOS
	partition structure of the disk you put these files on.  In
	the context of the install program you will only be able to
	identify the partition by starting sector (block) number
	and/or size.  The partition names are *not* available.

	Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
	step in the installation process, preparing your hard disk.
