To do the upgrade, and if you are using the miniroot installation, you
must have the OpenBSD kernel on AmigaDOS and you must transfer the root
filesystem miniroot{:--:}OSrev.fs onto the swap partition of the OpenBSD hard disk.
If you are using the ramdisk installation, the bsd.rd kernel is enough.
You must also have at least the "base{:--:}OSrev" binary distribution set available,
so that you can upgrade with it, using one of the upgrade methods described
above.  Finally, you must have sufficient disk space available to install
the new binaries.  Since the old binaries are being overwritten in place,
you only need space for the new binaries, which weren't previously
on the system.  If you have a few megabytes free on each of your
root and /usr partitions, you should have enough space.

Since upgrading involves replacing the kernel, and most of the system
binaries, it has the potential to cause data loss.  You are strongly
advised to BACK UP ANY IMPORTANT DATA ON YOUR DISK, whether on the
OpenBSD partition or on another operating system's partition, before
beginning the upgrade process.

To upgrade your system, follow the following instructions:

	If you know you need an -I option to loadbsd, you should add it
	to the loadbsd invocation you'll use for the upgrade.

	Miniroot installation:

	Transfer the upgrade miniroot filesystem onto the hard disk
	partition used by OpenBSD for swapping, as described in the
	"Preparing your System for OpenBSD Installation" section above.

	Now boot up OpenBSD using the OSREV kernel using the loadbsd
	command:

		loadbsd -b bsd

	You should see the screen clear and some information about
	your system as the kernel configures the hardware.  Note which
	hard disk device is configured that contains your root and
	swap partition.  When prompted for the root device, type
	'sd0*' (replacing 0 with the disk number that OpenBSD used for
	your root/swap device).  The '*' character indicates that the
	root filesystem is contained on the swap partition.  Continue
	reading below the ramdisk installation description:

	Ramdisk installation:

	Now boot up OpenBSD using the OSREV kernel using the loadbsd
	command:

		loadbsd bsd.rd

	You should see the screen clear and some information about
	your system as the kernel configures the hardware.

	Common instructions for both miniroot/ramdisk installations:

	You will be asked which terminal type to use, you should just
	hit return to select the default (vt220).

	When prompted, select the (U)pgrade option rather than the
	(I)install option.

	The upgrade script will ask you for the existing root partition,
	and will use the existing filesystems defined in /etc/fstab to
	installe the new system in, and also preserve files en `/etc'
	which you are likely to have customized since a previous
	installation.
