Booting the installation media:

The easiest way to boot into the OpenBSD installer is to copy the bsd.rd
installation kernel to the main linux partition, and boot from it.

Assuming the installation kernel has been copied to /boot/bsd.rd on the
Linux system, at the PMON prompt, enter:

    PMON> boot /dev/fs/ext2@wd0/boot/bsd.rd

to boot the installation kernel.

Alternatively, if your particular PMON flavour supports `fat' filesystems,
you can boot the kernel from an usb key with:

dnl check syntax
    PMON> boot /dev/fs/msdos@usb0:/bsd.rd

	The fdisk(8) utility will be invoked to let you edit your MBR
	partitioning.  The current MBR partitions defined will be
	displayed and you will be allowed to modify them, and add new
	partitions.

	After your OpenBSD MBR partition has been setup, the real
	partition setup can follow.

OpenBSDInstallWrapup

	As the OpenBSD/MACHINE port is very new, there is not yet a proper
	bootloader. In addition to these steps, you will need, for the time
	being, to copy the kernel image to the Linux partition and boot
	from it. This annoyance is being worked on and should disappear
	very soon.

	After the installation is complete, you should add an OpenBSD
	entry to the boot menu to be able to boot OpenBSD more easily.

	The boot menu contents are found in /boot/boot.cfg on the Linux
	partition. To add an OpenBSD entry, simply add a new entry in the
	file, such as:

	title OpenBSD
		kernel /dev/fs/ext2@wd0/boot/bsd
		args ""

	In the example above, /dev/fs/ext2@wd0/boot/bsd is the PMON path
	to the kernel image.

	You may make OpenBSD the default option by changing the ``default''
	line near the top of the file. The value on this line is the index
	of the default entry, starting at zero. So if you added the OpenBSD
	entry as the fourth entry in the file, it would become the default
	choice with:

	default 3

	The timeout until the default choice is selected, in seconds, can be
	modified on the ``timeout'' line.
