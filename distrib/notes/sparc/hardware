OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on the following classes of machines:
    * sun4: the VME series
	- 4/100: Original SPARC with VME. Many hardware bugs.
	- 4/200: A fairly decent VME-only machine
	- 4/300: a 25MHz VME machine with many devices built onto the main
	  board. In other respects, it is quite similar to the SS1+.

    * sun4c:
    	- SS1: the original 20MHz sun4c. Hardware limitations prevent SBus
	  DMA peripherals from working in some of the slots.
	- SS1+: 25MHz version of the above. Hardware limitations prevent
	  SBus DMA peripherals from working in some of the slots.
	- IPC: SS1+ in a cube, with bwtwo graphics builtin
	- SLC: SS1+ built into a B&W monitor
	- SS2: 40MHz version of the SS1
	- IPX: SS2 in a cube, with cgsix graphics builtin
	- ELC: SS2-performance built into a B&W monitor

    * sun4e:
	- SPARCengine 1E: a 6U VME cross between a sun4 and a sun4c,
	  similar to a Sun 4/300 with an OpenPROM interface.

    * sun4m:
	- 600MP: The original Sun4m machine. This is an mbus machine with
	  SBus and VME busses.
	- LC: 50MHz MicroSPARC-1 based machines (aka Classic)
	- LX: LC with a few more devices
	- SS4: Reduced cost version of the SS5, available at 70MHz and
	  110MHz
	- SS5: MicroSPARC-2 based machines available in 60, 70, 85, and 110
	  MHz versions
	- SS5: TurboSPARC cpus in accelerated SS5 machines, running at
	  170MHz
	- SS10: Pizzabox mbus-based machine
	- SS20: Improved pizzabox mbus-based machine
	- Sun Voyager

	- SM40: 40 MHz SuperSPARC with no secondary cache
	- SM41: 40 MHz SuperSPARC with 1MB of secondary cache
	- SM50: 50 MHz SuperSPARC with no secondary cache
	- SM51: 50 MHz SuperSPARC with 1MB of secondary cache
	- SM51-2: 50 MHz SuperSPARC with 2MB of secondary cache

	- Ross HyperSPARC RT620/625 at 166 MHz, with 512KB of primary cache
	- Ross HyperSPARC RT620/625 at 180 MHz, with 512KB of primary cache

24MB of RAM should be sufficient to boot and a minimal system can probably
be squeezed onto a 250MB disk by installing only the `base' set.
However, a minimum of 32MB is recommended for serious usage of the system.
Note that until you have at least 32MB of RAM, getting more RAM is more
important than getting a faster CPU board.

OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV does NOT run on these machines (yet):
	- Sun 4/400
		Lacking support for the I/O cache, and related
		Ethernet problems.
	- sun4d -- SPARCcenter 2000, SPARCserver 1000
		XDBus and multiprocessor support issues.
	- sun4u (UltraSPARCs)
		These machines are supported by the OpenBSD/sparc64 port.
	- clones that are significantly different from the Sun systems
		(e.g. K-Bus based Solbourne)

The supplied GENERIC kernel is the best attempt at a configuration that
works on the widest range of machines (sun4, sun4c, sun4e and sun4m).
