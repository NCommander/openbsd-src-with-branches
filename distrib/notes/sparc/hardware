OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on the following classes of machines:
	- sun4  -- 4/100, 4/200, and 4/300.   (note that support
		   for the 4/400 processor is incomplete)
	- sun4c -- SS1, SS1+, SS2, IPC, ELC, IPX, and SLC
	- sun4m -- Sun Sparc Classic, LX, 4, 5, 10, 20, and 600MP
	- Tadpole SPARCbook 3GS, 3GX and 3XP
	- Force CPU5V
	- as well as faithful clones of the above Sun systems, such as:
		+ Aries Research Inc, Parrot II
		+ Axil 243, 245, 320 (and possibly other models)
		+ Opus 5000, 5250
		+ TWS,SuperCOMPstation-20S
		+ Tatung micro COMPstation 5, COMPstation LX
		+ RDI BrideLite and PowerLite
		+ DTKstation/Classic+
		+ Transtec SS5/170

For sun4m machines, the following Mbus CPU modules are supported:
	- SM30, SM40, SM41, SM50, SM51, SM51-2, SM61, SM61-2, SM71,
	  SM81, SM81-2
	- SM100
	- Ross RT620/RT625 at 90, 125, 150 or 166 MHz

OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV does NOT run on these machines (yet):
	- Sun 4/400
		Lacking support for the I/O cache, and related
		ethernet problems.
	- sun4d -- SPARCcenter 2000, SPARCserver 1000
		XDBus and multiprocessor support issues.
	- sun4u (Ultrasparcs)
		These machines are supported by the OpenBSD/sparc64 port.
	- clones that are significantly different from the Sun systems 
		(e.g. K-Bus based Solbourne)

The minimal configuration requires 4M of RAM and ~60M of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (OpenBSD with 4M of
RAM feels like Solaris with 4M of RAM.) Note that until you have
around 16M of RAM, getting more RAM is more important than getting a
faster CPU.)  Installation from "ramdisk" kernels requires 8M of RAM.

Hardware the we do NOT currently support, but get many questions about:
	Multiprocessor machines (Will not boot correctly on multiple CPU sun4m)
	Audio driver for some sun4m machines (LX,ZX,ss10,ss20)
	Floppy driver for sun4m (can boot/install from ramdisk floppies though)
	Interrupt driven SCSI driver for Sun 4/100's and 4/200's
        VME mti 16-port serial card
        VME alm2 16-port serial card

        SBus ZX framebuffer (aka Leo)
	Tadpole onboard PCMCIA and modem

The supplied GENERIC kernel is the best attempt at a configuration that
works on the widest range of machinery (sun4, sun4c, and sun4m).  
If you have problems with the OpenBSD OSREV kernel in this distribution, 
please visit the OpenBSD web page (http://www.openbsd.org) and the mailing 
lists to review the current status and check for updates and distribution
errata.

If you have Sparc hardware you can donate or make available at nominal
cost, please mention this on the lists, many things aren't being tested
or developed simply because developers usually have only a Sparcstation
at hand, not an array of systems.  Donation or mid/long term loan of
UltraSparc (sun4u) or HyperSparc (sun4m) systems would help ensure the
long-term viability of OpenBSD on Sparc based systems.

Your support in terms of documenting previously unknown problems with
OpenBSD/MACHINE, helping debug known problems, implementing missing pieces,
and testing OpenBSD on various architectures is actively encouraged.
The OpenBSD mailing lists, web-pages and sendbug utility are your best
tools for helping make OpenBSD/MACHINE a better release.
