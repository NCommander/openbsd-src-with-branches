OpenBSD/sparc 2.1 runs on the following classes of machines:
	- sun4c (e.g. the SS1, SS1+, SS2, IPC, ELC, IPX, and SLC)
	- sun4 (e.g. the 4/100, 4/200, and 4/300.   note that support
		for the 4/400 processor is incomplete)
	- sun4m (e.g. sparc classic, 4, 5, 10, and 20) *** See Notes Below

OpenBSD/sparc 2.1 does NOT run on these machines (yet):
	- Sun 4/400 (lacking support for the I/O cache, and has
			ethernet problems)
	- sun4d (e.g. sparc center 2000)
	- sun4u (e.g. Ultrasparcs)

The minimal configuration requires 4M of RAM and ~60M of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (OpenBSD with 4M of
RAM feels like Solaris with 4M of RAM.) Note that until you have
around 16M of RAM, getting more RAM is more important than getting a
faster CPU.)

Supported devices include:
	sun4c and sun4m SBus video: 
		cgsix, cgthree, and bwtwo frame buffers

	sun4 video (not thoroughly tested...): 
		P4  -- on-board bwtwo, cgfour, cgsix, cgeight
                VME -- cgtwo, cgthree, cgsix 

	serial ports: 
		ttya and ttyb (can be used as console if needed),
                ttyc and ttyd (Sun 4/300 only)

	ethernet: 
		on-board AMD Lance ethernet ("le0"), 
		SBus AMD Lance ethernet cards, 
		on-board Intel 82586 ethernet (ie0 on 4/100's and 4/200's), 
		VME Intel 82586 ethernet cards

	SCSI: 
		on-board "esp" SCSI controller (sun4c's, and the 4/300),
		SBus "esp" SCSI controller, 
		Sun "SUN-3"/"si" VME SCSI controller (polled mode only, slow),
		Sun "SCSI Weird"/"sw" on-board controller (4/110 only, polled)

	VME disks:
		Xylogics 7053 VME/SMD disk controller ("xd"),
		Xylogics 450/451 VME disk controller ("xy")
		[note: VME/IPI disks are not supported]

	Sun floppy disk drive on sun4c machines.

	Sun keyboard and mouse.

	sun4c audio.


Hardware the we do NOT currently support, but get many questions
about:
	multiprocessor machines (ignores other CPUs..)
	audio driver for sun4m machines
	floppy driver for sun4m (can boot/install from ramdisk floppies though)
	interrupt driven SCSI driver for Sun 4/100's and 4/200's
        VME mti 16-port serial card
        VME alm2 16-port serial card
        VME mcp 4-port serial card 
        VME IPI controller
        VME cgfive framebuffer
        VME cgnine framebuffer
        VME GP/GP2 Graphics Processor
        SBus cgeight framebuffers
        SBus GS framebuffer (aka cgtwelve)
        SBus GT framebuffer ("Graphics Tower")
        SS20 SX framebuffer (aka cgfourteen)
        SBus ZX framebuffer (aka Leo)
        S24 (ss5 only) framebuffer

*** Note: sun4m caveats
  There are some known difficulties with some configurations of 
sun4m machines.  While the details have not been worked out fully,
tests show that there are problems with some sun4m systems, depending
on memory configuration and other factors.  The supplied GENERIC kernel
is the best attempt at a configuration that works on the widest range of
machinery (sun4m and otherwise).  Custom kernel configurations for sun4m
may run into difficulties, GENERIC is your best bet for a stable sun4m. 
Stability of the sun4m support in OpenBSD is improving, if you have
problems with the kernel supplied in this OpenBSD 2.1 release, 
visit the OpenBSD web page (http://www.openbsd.org/), use sendbug,
and get on the openbsd mailing lists for current information.
