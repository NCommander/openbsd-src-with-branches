NetBSD/sparc 1.0 runs on Sun4c class machines only, which includes
the SS1, SS1+, SS2, IPC, ELC, IPX, and the SLC.  It does not run
on Sun4, Sun4m, or Sun4d machines.

The minimal configuration requires 4M of RAM and ~60M of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (NetBSD with 4M of
RAM feels like Solaris with 4M of RAM.) Note that until you have
around 16M of RAM, getting more RAM is more important than getting a
faster CPU.)

Supported devices include:
	Video: cgthree, cgsix, and bwtwo frame buffers
	Serial ports: ttya and ttyb
	On-board AMD Lance ethernet
	Some SCSI CD-ROM drives
	Sun keyboard and mouse

Hardware the we do NOT currently support, but get many questions
about:
	The floppy drive.

The next release will likely run on many more machines.  In
particular, some Sun4 support will be there, and perhaps even
Sun4m.
