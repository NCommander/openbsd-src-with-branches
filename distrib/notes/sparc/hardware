OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on the following classes of machines:
    * sun4: the VME series
	- 4/100: Original sparc with VME. Many hardware bugs.
	- 4/200: A fairly decent VME-only machine
	- 4/300: a 25MHz VME machine with many devices built onto the main
	  board. In other respects, it is quite similar to the SS1+.

    * sun4c:
    	- SS1: the original 20MHz sun4c. Hardware limitations prevent SBus
	  DMA peripherals from working in some of the slots.
	- SS1+: 25MHz version of the above. Hardware limitations prevent
	  SBus DMA peripherals from working in some of the slots.
	- IPC: SS1+ in a cube, with bwtwo graphics builtin
	- SLC: SS1+ built into a B&W monitor
	- SS2: 40MHz version of the SS1
	- IPX: SS2 in a cube, with cgsix graphics builtin
	- ELC: SS2-performance built into a B&W monitor

    * sun4m:
	- 600MP: The original Sun4m machine. This is an mbus machine with
	  SBus and VME busses.
	- LC: 50MHz MicroSPARC-1 based machines (aka Classic)
	- LX: LC with a few more devices
	- SS4: Reduced cost version of the SS5, available at 70MHz and
	  110MHz
	- SS5: MicroSPARC-2 based machines available in 60, 70, 85, and 110
	  MHz versions
	- SS5: TurboSPARC cpus in accelerated SS5 machines, running at
	  170MHz
	- SS10: Pizzabox mbus-based machine
	- SS20: Improved pizzabox mbus-based machine
	- Sun Voyager

    * As well as faithful clones of the above Sun systems, such as:
	- Aries Research Inc, Parrot II (SS2 clone)
	- Axil 243 and 245 (and possibly other models) (SS5 clones)
	- Axil 320 (SS20 clone)
	- Opus 5000 (SS1 clone)
	- Opus 5250 (SS1 clone)
	- SPARCbook 3, 3GS, 3GX, 3TX and 3XP by Tadpole (MicroSPARC-2)
	- CPU5V: VME card by Force Computer (sun4m)
	- TWS,SuperCOMPstation-20S (SS20 clone)
	- Tatung micro COMPstation 5 (SS5 clone)
	- Tatung micro COMPstation LX (LX clone)
	- RDI,PowerLite: sun4m models, available in 50, 85 and 110 MHz
	- RDI,BrideLite
	- DTKstation/Classic+
	- Transtec SS5/170

For sun4m machines, the following mbus CPU modules are supported:
	- SM30: 30 or 36 MHz SuperSPARC with no secondary cache
	- SM40: 40 MHz SuperSPARC with no secondary cache
	- SM41: 40 MHz SuperSPARC with 1MB of secondary cache
	- SM50: 50 MHz SuperSPARC with no secondary cache
	- SM51: 50 MHz SuperSPARC with 1MB of secondary cache
	- SM51-2: 50 MHz SuperSPARC with 2MB of secondary cache
	- SM61: 60 MHz SuperSPARC with 1MB of secondary cache
	- SM61-2: 60 MHz SuperSPARC with 2MB of secondary cache
	- SM71: 75 MHz SuperSPARC with 1MB of secondary cache
	- SM81: 85 MHz SuperSPARC with 1MB of secondary cache
	- SM81-2: 85 MHz SuperSPARC with 2MB of secondary cache
	- SM100: dual 40 MHz Cypress 7C601 with 64KB of primary cache
	- Ross HyperSparc RT620/625 at 90 MHz, with 256KB of primary cache
	- Ross HyperSparc RT620/625 at 125 MHz, with 256KB of primary cache
	- Ross HyperSparc RT620/625 at 150 MHz, with 512KB of primary cache
	- Ross HyperSparc RT620/625 at 166 MHz, with 512KB of primary cache
	- Ross HyperSparc RT620/625 at 180 MHz, with 512KB of primary cache

The minimal configuration requires 4M of RAM and ~60M of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (OpenBSD with 4M of
RAM feels like Solaris with 4M of RAM.) Note that until you have
around 16M of RAM, getting more RAM is more important than getting a
faster CPU.)  Installation from "ramdisk" kernels requires 8M of RAM.

    * Miscellaneous:
	- SBus Expansion Subsystem (SUNW,xbox) (xbox)
	- Force FGA5000 VME/SBus bridge (fga)
	- Force system configuration registers (scf)
	- Force flash memory (flash)
	- Tadpole microcontroller (power/system control) (tctrl)
	- Prestoserve NVRAM Sbus cards (limited support) (presto)

OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV does NOT run on these machines (yet):
	- Sun 4/400
		Lacking support for the I/O cache, and related
		Ethernet problems.
	- sun4d -- SPARCcenter 2000, SPARCserver 1000
		XDBus and multiprocessor support issues.
	- sun4u (UltraSPARCs)
		These machines are supported by the OpenBSD/sparc64 port.
	- clones that are significantly different from the Sun systems
		(e.g. K-Bus based Solbourne)

Hardware that we do NOT currently support, but get many questions about:
    * Serial Cards:
        - VME mti 16-port serial card
        - VME alm2 16-port serial card
        - VME mcp 4-port serial card (or is it 8-port)
    * Disk Controllers:
        - VME "sc" SCSI controller
        - VME IPI controller
    * Framebuffers:
        - VME cgfive, 8-bit color, 1-bit overlay, double-buffered,
	  unaccelerated without GP/GP2
        - VME cgnine, 24-bit color, 1-bit overlay, double-buffered,
	  unaccelerated without GP/GP2
        - VME GP/GP2 Graphics Processor (drives a cgfive or cgnine)
        - SBus cgeight, 24-bit color, unaccelerated
        - SBus GT, 24-bit color, 8-bit color, overlay planes,
	  double-buffered, 3-D acceleration (aka "Graphics Tower")
    * On-board Audio and ISDN
	This is present on some sun4m systems (LX, LC, SPARCstation 10/20)
    * Multiple Processors/Modules in sun4m systems
	OpenBSD will not currently boot on some machines with multiple
	processors. You must remove the extra CPUs.
    * SBus SUNW,bpp (parallel port)
    * SBus FAS SCSI controllers
	The FAS-only card is not supported. The HME+FAS card only supports
	the HME part of the card.
    * SBus FDDI cards

The supplied GENERIC kernel is the best attempt at a configuration that
works on the widest range of machines (sun4, sun4c, and sun4m).
