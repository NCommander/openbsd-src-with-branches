The sparc-specific portion of the OpenBSD 2.1 release is found in the
"sparc" subdirectory of the distribution.  That subdirectory is laid
out as follows:

.../2.1/sparc/
		INSTALL.sparc	Installation notes; this file

		floppy.fs	The sparc boot and installation
				floppy; see below.

                kc21.fs		The sparc boot floppy; see below.
		inst21.fs	The sparc installation floppy; see below.
		upgr21.fs	The sparc upgrade floppy; see below.
		miniroot21.fs	The sparc miniroot filesystem; see below.

		*.gz		sparc binary distribution sets;
				see below.

		bsd		A stock GENERIC kernel
                bsd.rd		A ramdisk kernel
		bsd.scsi3	A kernel with SCSI target 3 remapped as 0
				and 0 mapped as 3.

		bootxx		The OpenBSD/sparc boot block
		boot		The OpenBSD/sparc secondary boot loader

		X11		The X Windows distribution for OpenBSD/sparc


In summary, there is one bootable sparc floppy image called "kc21.fs".
This is a bootable install floppy which can be used in conjunction with
the "inst21.fs" or "upgr21.fs" floppy images to install or upgrade OpenBSD 
to the current version.  It is also useful for maintenance and disaster 
recovery.  The miniroot.fs may be loaded onto the swap partition of an
existing installation of OpenBSD, NetBSD, SunOS, or Solaris to allow
installation or upgrade over the existing system.

Bootable installation/upgrade floppies:
  
  kc21.fs
 	This disk is bootable, and only contains the boot loader and
        kernel.

  inst21.fs
	This disk contains an installation file system, and has enough 
	utilities on board to prepare your hard disk drive for OpenBSD.

  upgr21.fs
	This disk contains a file system, and has holds the utilities 
	needed in order to upgrade a system to OpenBSD 2.1
  
  miniroot21.fs
	This is a miniroot filesystem image which can be copied to the
	swap partition of an existing OpenBSD, NetBSD, SunOS, or Solaris
	installation to allow upgrading to OpenBSD 2.1

The OpenBSD/sparc binary distribution sets contain the binaries which
comprise the OpenBSD 2.1 release for the sparc.  There are seven binary
distribution sets, and the "security" distribution set.  The binary
distribution sets can be found in subdirectories of the "sparc/bins"
subdirectory of the OpenBSD 2.1 distribution tree, and are as follows:

	base21	The OpenBSD/sparc 2.1 base binary distribution.  You
		MUST install this distribution set.  It contains the
		base OpenBSD utilities that are necessary for the
		system to run and be minimally functional.  It
		includes shared library support, and excludes
		everything described below.
		[ 13.1M gzipped, 41.7M uncompressed ]

	comp21	The OpenBSD/sparc Compiler tools.  All of the tools
		relating to C, C++, and FORTRAN.
		This set includes the system include files
		(/usr/include), the linker, the compiler tool chain,
		and the various system libraries (except the shared
		libraries, which are included as part of the base
		set).  This set also includes the manual pages for all
		of the utilities it contains, as well as the system
		call and library manual pages.
		[ 8.7M gzipped, 28.8M uncompressed ]

	etc21	This distribution set contains the system
		configuration files that reside in /etc and in several
		other places.  This set MUST be installed if you are
		installing the system from scratch, but should NOT be
		used if you are upgrading.  (If you are upgrading,
		it's recommended that you get a copy of this set and
		CAREFULLY upgrade your configuration files by hand.)
		[ 95K gzipped, 460K uncompressed ]

	game21	This set includes the games and their manual pages.
		[ 2.9M gzipped, 7.3M uncompressed ]

	man21	This set includes all of the manual pages for the
		binaries and other software contained in the base set.
		Note that it does not include any of the manual pages
		that are included in the other sets.
		[ 2.5M gzipped, 9.4M uncompressed ]

	misc21	This set includes the system dictionaries (which are
		rather large), the typesettable document set, and
		man pages for other architectures which happen to be
		installed from the source tree by default.
		[ 1.8M gzipped, 6.2M uncompressed ]

	text21	This set includes OpenBSD's text processing tools,
		including groff, all related programs, and their
		manual pages.
		[ 1.0M gzipped, 3.9M uncompressed ]
