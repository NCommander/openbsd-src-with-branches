Please note that there are multiple bootable images and kernels, intended
to allow installing OpenBSD/MACHINE in a variety of situations without
requiring a pre-existing working operating system.

The kernel and boot images are provided for net booting installations.
While the OpenBSD bootblocks will work with the provided miniroot images,
Sun bootblocks require a separate kernel image and root filesystem.
