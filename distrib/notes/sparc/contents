		bsd.scsi3	A kernel with SCSI target 3 re-mapped as 0
				and 0 mapped as 3.

		installboot	The OpenBSD/sparc boot loader installation`
				program
		bootxx		The OpenBSD/sparc boot block
		boot		The OpenBSD/sparc secondary boot loader
		boot.net	The OpenBSD/sparc network boot loader


Please note that there are multiple bootable images and kernels, intended
to allow installing OpenBSD/sparc in a variety of situations without
requiring a pre-existing working operating system.

The "miniroot{:--:}OSrev.fs" is a small bootable root filesystem that can be used
for installation or upgrade where there is some means to copy the miniroot
image into a swap or unused partition on the system, and also for diskless
or net booting.  This can be convenient if you have a existing installation
of OpenBSD, NetBSD, SunOS, or Solaris and wish to test or upgrade the
existing system to OpenBSD.

The "floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs" is a bootable floppy image, with contents similar
to a miniroot stored in a compressed kernel with pre-loaded ramdisk.

These bootable images are also useful as "failsafe" boots for system
maintenance and disaster recovery.

The kernel and boot images are provided for net booting installations.
While the OpenBSD bootblocks will work with the provided miniroot images,
Sun bootblocks require a separate kernel image and root filesystem.


Bootable installation images:
  
  floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs
	This disk contains a compressed ramdisk filesystem, and holds
        all utilities needed to install OpenBSD OSREV
  
  miniroot{:--:}OSrev.fs
	This is a miniroot filesystem image which can be copied to the
	swap partition of an existing OpenBSD, NetBSD, Linux, SunOS, 
	or Solaris installation to allow upgrading to OpenBSD OSREV
