OpenBSDInstallPrelude

There are several ways to install OpenBSD onto a disk. The easiest way
in terms of preliminary setup is to use the OpenBSD miniroot that can
be booted off your local disk's swap partition.   The normal way is to
use the OpenBSD installation floppy, or an installation tape.

If your Sparc is hooked up in a network and you can find a server to
arrange for a diskless setup, which is a convenient way to install on a
machine whose disk does not currently hold a usable operating system.
This is difficult to get set up correctly the first time, but easy to
use afterwards.  (see ``Installing using a diskless setup'' below).

It is also possible to install OpenBSD "manually" from a running SunOS
system, using SunOS tools and gnu tar and gunzip (see ``Installing from
SunOS'' below).


Booting from the Installation Media:

Prior to attempting an installation, you should make sure that everything
of value on the target system has been backed up.  While installing OpenBSD
does not necessarily wipe out all the partitions on the hard disk, errors
during the install process can have unforeseen consequences and you will
probably render the system unbootable if you start, but do not complete
the installation.  Having the installation media for the prior installation,
be it a SunOS or OpenBSD CD-ROM or OpenBSD install diskettes is good
insurance if you want to be able to "go back" for some reason.

After taking care of all that, bring your system down gracefully using
the shutdown(8) and/or halt(8) commands.  This will get you to the monitor
prompt.  Sun PROM monitor commands and setup differ considerably depending
on the system architecture and age, you may needed to reference the PROM
monitor manual for your system for details.

There are four main cases:

	sun4 (older servers, deskside workstations):
		prompt is a ">", boot command is "b", uses sd(c,s,p) syntax
		with s defined as scsi-unit*8+lun in hex
	OpenBoot Version 1 (newer servers, desktop workstations):
		prompt is "ok", boot command is "boot" uses sd(c,s,p) syntax
		with s defined as scsi-unit.
	OpenBoot Version 2 (newer servers, desktop workstations):
		prompt is "ok", boot command is "boot" uses diskn:p syntax.
        OpenBoot Version 2 (certain newer desktop workstations):
		prompt is "ok", boot command is "boot" uses diskn syntax 
		unless booting from a non-standard partition, in which case:
		boot /sbus/esp/sd@t,0:p bsd  (where "t" is the scsi target, 
		and "p" is the partition.  examples would be t="3" and p="b")

	
If you expect your workstation to have an OpenBoot Prom but get a ">", 
enter then "n" command to enter the "new command mode".  You can set this
as the default by doing a "setenv sunmon-compat? false" command, followed
by a "reset" command.

Note that OpenBoot Proms also do the Sun SCSI-ID shuffle for disks, this
is described elsewhere in some detail.  For the purposes of this section,
drive 0 refers to the internal or first SCSI drive, which usually has a
SCSI-ID of 3.

 
Booting from Floppy Disk installation media:
 
        ok boot fd()bsd         # for version 1 OpenBOOT ROMs
        ok boot floppy bsd      # for version 2 OpenBOOT ROMs

This will cause the kernel contained in the floppy to be booted.

After the initial device probe messages you'll asked to start the
install or upgrade procedure. Proceed to the section ``Running the
installation scripts'' below.


Booting From CD-ROM installation media:

	> b sd(,30,0)OSREV/sparc/bsd.rd		# for Sun4 monitors*
						# (not working currently)
	ok boot sd(,6,0)OSREV/sparc/bsd.rd	# for version 1 OpenBOOT ROMs
	ok boot cdrom OSREV/sparc/bsd.rd	# for version 2 OpenBOOT ROMs

If the boot is successful, you will get a loader version message,
executable sizes and then the Kernel copyright and device probe
messages.  Boot failure modes are typically a lot of CD-ROM drive
activity, but no messages or complaints about magic numbers,
checksums or formats.

Not all sparc systems support bootable CDROMS and the current
boot image is only known to work on sun4c and sun4m architectures.
If it does not work, you'll have to create a boot floppy or bootable
hard disk using the instructions under preparing boot media.

After the initial device probe messages you'll asked to start the
install or upgrade procedure. Proceed to the section ``Running the
installation scripts'' below.


Booting from SCSI disk (miniroot or floppy image):

Boot the miniroot by typing the appropriate command at the PROM:

	> b sd(,,1)bsd 			# for sun4 monitors*
	ok boot sd(,,1)bsd 		# for version 1 OpenBOOT ROMs
	ok boot disk:b bsd 		# for version 2 OpenBOOT ROMs
	ok boot /sbus/esp/sd@3,0:b bsd  # for version 2 OpenBOOT ROMs 
					# that won't take disk:p syntax.

If you've loaded the miniroot onto some other disk than the default
drive 0, modify the boot specifier accordingly, keeping in mind the
drive vs. scsi-id shuffling and partition a=0, b=1... 

        > b sd(0,10,1)bsd       # example - scsi target 2 on sun4 monitors*
	ok boot sd(0,3,1)bsd	# example - scsi target 0 on v1 OpenBOOT ROM
	ok boot disk3:b bsd     # example - scsi target 0 on v2 OpenBOOT ROM
	ok boot /sbus/esp/sd@0,0:b bsd  # example - scsi target 0 on v2  
					# OpenBOOT ROM that won't take 
					# disk:p syntax.

(*) for sun4 this is scsi-target*8+scsi-lun (usually 0) expressed in hex...

This will cause the kernel contained in the miniroot to be booted.
After the initial device probe messages you'll asked to start the
install or upgrade procedure. Proceed to the section ``Running the
installation scripts'' below.


Booting from SCSI tape:

Boot the miniroot by typing the appropriate command at the PROM:

	> b st(,,1)			# for sun4 monitors
					# (not working currently)
	ok boot st(,,1)			# for version 1 OpenBOOT ROMs
	ok boot tape:1			# for version 2 OpenBOOT ROMs
	ok boot /sbus/esp/st@4,0:1	# for version 2 OpenBOOT ROMs
					# that won't take tape:n syntax.
	
The above instructions assume your tape drive is the default tape drive
using SCSI id 4. If your drive uses id 5, modify the boot command
accordingly:

	> b st(,28,1)		# example - 2nd tape drive on sun4 monitors
	ok boot st(,5,1)	# example - 2nd tape drive on v1 OpenBOOT ROM
	ok boot tape1:1		# example - 2nd tape drive on v2 OpenBOOT ROM
	ok boot /sbus/esp/st@5,0:1	# example - 2nd tape drive on v2
					# OpenBOOT ROM that won't take
					# tape:n syntax
	
This will cause the kernel contained in the miniroot to be booted.
After the initial device probe messages you'll be asked to start the
install or upgrade procedure. Proceed to the section ``Running the
installation scripts'' below.


Installing using a diskless setup:

First, you must setup a diskless client configuration on a server. If
you are using a OpenBSD system as the boot-server, have a look at the
diskless(8) manual page for guidelines on how to proceed with this.
If the server runs another operating system, you'll have to consult
documentation that came with it (on SunOS systems, add_client(8) and
the Sun System/Networks administrators guide constitute a good start).


Boot your workstation from the server by entering the appropriate `boot'
command at the monitor prompt. Depending on the PROM version in your machine,
this command takes one of the following forms:

	> b le()bsd.rd		# for sun4 monitors
	ok boot le()bsd.rd	# for version 1 OpenBOOT ROMs
	ok boot net bsd.rd	# for version 2 OpenBOOT ROMs

This will cause the kernel provided by the diskless setup to be booted.
After the initial probe messages you'll asked to start the install
or upgrade procedure. Proceed to the section ``Running the installation
scripts'' below.


Installing using the Floppy, CD-ROM, tape, miniroot or netboot procedure:

OpenBSDInstallPart2

	Boot your machine from the installation media as described above.

	It will take a while to load the kernel especially from a floppy
	or slow network connection, most likely more than a minute.  If
	some action doesn't eventually happen, or the spinning cursor has
	stopped and nothing further has happened, either your boot media
	is bad, your diskless setup isn't correct, or you may have
	a hardware or configuration problem.

OpenBSDBootMsgs

	While booting, you will probably see several warnings.  You
	may be warned that the kernel can't figure out what device
	it booted from and that no swap space is present.  Do not be
	alarmed, these are completely normal.  The first warning
	occurs because while OpenBSD/sparc can boot from the floppy
	drive, the kernel itself lacks a floppy driver for some
        architectures.

	Next there will be a prompt asking you for a shell name, just
	hit return to start executing the installation setup script.

	You will next be asked for your terminal type.  If you are
	installing from a keyboard/monitor console, the default of
	"sun" if correct.  If you are installing from a serial console
	you should choose the terminal type from amongst those listed.
	(If your terminal type is xterm, just use vt100).

	After entering the terminal type you will be greeted by a
	welcome message and asked if you really want to continue.
	Assuming you answered yes, the install program will then tell
	you which disks of that type it can install on, and ask you
	which it should use.  The name of the disk is typically "sd0".
	Reply with the name of your disk.

	Next you will have to edit or create a disklabel for the disk
	OpenBSD is being installed on.  The installation script will
	invoke the text editor allowing you to do this.  Note that
	partition 'c' inside this disk label should ALWAYS reflect the
	entire disk, including any non-OpenBSD portions.  The root file
	system should be in partition 'a', and swap is usually in partition
	'b'.  It is recommended that you create separate partitions for
	root and /usr, you may also want to specify /var and /home
	partitions.

	The swap partition (usually 'b') should have a type of "swap", all
	other native OpenBSD partitions should have a type of "4.2BSD".
	Block and fragment sizes are usually 8192 and 1024 bytes, but can
	also be 16384 and 2048 bytes.

	The install program will now label your disk and ask which file
	systems should be created on which partitions.  It will auto-
	matically select the 'a' partition to be the root file system.
	Next it will ask for which disk and partition you want a file
	system created on.  This will be the same as the disk name (e.g.
	"sd0") with the letter identifying the partition (e.g. "d")
	appended (e.g. "sd0d").  Then it will ask where this partition is
	to be mounted, e.g. /usr.  This process will be repeated until
	you type "done".

	At this point you will be asked to confirm that the file system
	information you have entered is correct, and given an opportunity
	to change the file system table.  Next it will create the new file
	systems as specified, OVERWRITING ANY EXISTING DATA.  This is the
	point of no return.

	After all your file systems have been created, the install program
	will give you an opportunity to configure the network.  The network
	configuration you enter (if any) can then be used to do the install
	from another system using NFS, HTTP or FTP, and will also be the
	configuration used by the system after the installation is complete.

	If you select to configure the network, the install program will
	ask you for a name of your system and the DNS domain name to use.
	Note that the host name should be without the domain part, and that
	the domain name should NOT {:-include-:} the host name part.

	Next the system will give you a list of network interfaces you can
	configure.  For each network interface you select to configure, it
	will ask for the IP address to use, the symbolic host name to use,
	the netmask to use and any media flags to set.  This is driver
	dependent, but for the sparc le(4) driver, the flags usually carry
	meaning:

		auto		Use existing setting (only setup by netboot)
		10baseT		Use UTP (twisted pair) port
		10base5 	Use AUI port

*** IMPORTANT - these are the correct setting for Sparc ethernet cards,
		the suggestions shown by the install script are generic
		and may or may not be correct...

	After all network interfaces have been configured the install pro-
	gram will ask for a default route and IP address of the primary
	name server to use.  You will also be presented with an opportunity
	to edit the host table.

	At this point you will be allowed to edit the file system table
	that will be used for the remainder of the installation and that
	will be used by the finished system, following which the new file
	systems will be mounted to complete the installation.

	After these preparatory steps has been completed, you will be
	able to extract the distribution sets onto your system.  There
	are several install methods supported; FTP, HTTP, tape, CD-ROM, NFS
	or a local disk partition.  To install from a tape, the distrib-
	ution sets must have been written to tape prior to running the
	installation program, either as tar images or as gzipped tar
	images.  Note that installation sets on multiple floppies is not
	currently supported.

After completing an installation:

Now try a reboot.  (If needed, swap your scsi id's first).  Initially
I'd suggest you "boot sd()bsd -bs", then try multiuser after that.
if you boot single-user the OpenBSD incantation to make the root
filesystem writable is

    OpenBSD# mount -u /dev/sd0a /

The Sun monitor normally tries to load a file called "vmunix".   
On OpenBOOT ROM systems you can change it to load OpenBSD instead using
the following commands:

On version 1 OpenBOOT ROMs:
    >n
    ok setenv boot-from sd(0,0,0)bsd
    ok

On version 2 OpenBOOT ROMs:
    ok setenv boot-file bsd
    ok setenv boot-device /sbus/esp/sd@0,0

On sun4 systems, you may not need to specify the boot file, as 
the OpenBSD boot blocks will look for "bsd" on the boot device by default.

OpenBSDCongratulations

If you will be running your OpenBSD system from a serial console, you may
need to edit /etc/ttys and change the terminal type, and getty method from
"sun" and "suncons" to "vt100" and "std.9600" or something similar.  Also
when running from a serial console, you may wish to adjust the eeprom
settings for input-device, output-device, screen-#columns, and screen-#rows
as appropriate.  

If you plan on using the extra serial ports on 4/300 systems, 
you'll need to make sure you have device nodes for them e.g.:
  mknod /dev/ttyc c 12 4
  mknod /dev/ttyd c 12 5
To use these ports for terminals etc, you will want to add them to
/etc/ttys.

In order to use 'tip' on OpenBSD/sparc, you'll need to edit /etc/ttys
and add "local" to the end of the tty configuration line, and run 
'ttyflags -a' to put your changes into effect.

If you are unfamiliar with UN*X-like system administration, 
it's recommended that you buy a book that discusses it.



Installing from SunOS.

You need a SunOS machine to install OpenBSD.  You also need at
least the following pieces:

    the *.tgz files you want to install (as a minimum, base{:--:}OSrev.tgz and
       etc{:--:}OSrev.tgz)
    gunzip (GNU gzip) SunOS binary
    gtar (GNU tar) SunOS binary
    a "/boot" file from a SunOS machine that matches your machine type
	(e.g. sun or sun4c)
    a kernel, most likely "/bsd"

All these pieces, except "/boot" and the GNU utilities are supplied in
the OpenBSD/sparc distribution.

You need to format and partition the disk using SunOS (since
OpenBSD/sparc uses SunOS disk labels.)  Give yourself adequate
partition sizes.  Here is an example layout:

    partition    size   offset	  will be..
    sd0a        80000        0	  /
    sd0b       256000    80000	  swap
    sd0c      4165271        0	  `whole disk'
    sd0d       100000   436000    /var
    sd0f       100000   336000    /tmp
    sd0g      3229271   936000    /usr
    sd0h       400000   536000    /var/tmp

Use SunOS to newfs the partitions which will have filesystems on them.
(OpenBSD's filesystem format is identical to SunOS).

    sunos# newfs /dev/rsd0a
    [... lots of output]
 
Repeat for any other partition (in this example, /dev/rsd0d, /dev/rsd0f,
/dev/rsd0g, /dev/rsd0h).

NOTE: If you are able to, there is a performance benefit from
newfs'ing using OpenBSD.  If you newfs using the OpenBSD newfs command,
be sure to use the -O flag for your / partition, so that newfs will
use the 4.3BSD filesystem format, rather than the new 4.4BSD filesystem
format.  If you forget, you will not be able to boot -- the SunOS boot
blocks do not understand the extended 4.4BSD filesystem format.

Mount those partitions in a tree formation, under /mnt; ie:

    sunos# df
    Filesystem            kbytes    used   avail capacity  Mounted on
    [...]
    /dev/sd0a              38427       0   38427     0%    /mnt
    /dev/sd0d              48249       0   48249     0%    /mnt/var
    /dev/sd0f              48249       0   48249     0%    /mnt/tmp
    /dev/sd0g            1564024       0 1564024     0%    /mnt/usr
    /dev/sd0h             193536       0  193536     0%    /mnt/var/tmp

Place a standard SunOS "boot" program in /mnt (your new root
partition), and use the SunOS command "installboot" to make it work.
The installboot man page says to do something like this:

    sunos# cp /usr/mdec/sdboot /mnt/boot
    sunos# sync; sync
    sunos# /usr/mdec/installboot -vlt /mnt/boot /usr/mdec/bootsd /dev/rsd2a

You can now extract the provided "*.tgz files onto your disk.

    sunos# ls -FC
    base{:--:}OSrev.tgz   comp{:--:}OSrev.tgz   man{:--:}OSrev.tgz       xfont{:--:}OSrev.tgz
    bsd             etc{:--:}OSrev.tgz    misc{:--:}OSrev.tgz      xserv{:--:}OSrev.tgz
    bsd.scsi3       game{:--:}OSrev.tgz   xbase{:--:}OSrev.tgz
    sunos{:-#-:} gunzip < base{:--:}OSrev.tgz | (cd /mnt; gtar xvpf -)
    [...] for each set

And finally copy an OpenBSD kernel (either bsd or bsd.scsi3) onto your disk.

    sunos# cp bsd.scsi3 /mnt/bsd

The GNU gunzip and gtar programs are not distributed as part of SunOS,
but may be present in your /usr/local/bin.  If not, you will need to
obtain them from a GNU archive and install before proceeding.  The
OpenBSD tar files are in the "new format" that includes directory
information, and the standard SunOS tar will not extract from them
successfully.

After the files have been extracted, setup /mnt/etc/fstab to match
your actual disk layout.  (Minus the "/mnt" component of each path, of
course :-)

Now proceed to reboot the machine and the customize your installation.


Net Boot or Diskless Setup Information:

The set up is similar to SunOS diskless setup, but not identical, because
the Sun setup assumes that the bootblocks load a kernel image, which then
uses NFS to access the exported root partition, while the OpenBSD bootblocks
use internal NFS routines to load the kernel image directly from the
exported root partition.

Please understand that no one gets this right the first try, since
there is a lot of setup and all the host daemons must be running and
configured correctly.  If you have problems, extract the diskless(8)
manpage, find someone who's been through it before and use the host
syslog and tcpdump(8) to get visibility of what's happening (or not).

Your Sparcstation expects to be able to download a second stage bootstrap
program via TFTP after having acquired its IP address through RevARP when
instructed to boot "over the net". It will look for a filename composed of
the machine's IP address followed by the machine's architecture, separated
by a period. For example, a sun4c machine which has been assigned IP
address 130.115.144.11, will make an TFTP request for `8273900B.SUN4C'.
Normally, this file is a symbolic link to an appropriate second-stage
boot program, which should be located in a place where the TFTP daemon
can find it (remember, many TFTP daemons run in a chroot'ed environment).

You can find the boot program in `/usr/mdec/boot' in the OpenBSD/sparc
distribution. Unfortunately, it is necessary to install this file
differently for sun4 and sun4c clients: the sun4 version needs to have its
`a.out' header stripped off (otherwise the machine will crash), while the
sun4c version must retain it (otherwise the PROM will complain).

Here's an example to illustrate this whole mess:

    server# cd /<client-root-dir>/usr/mdec
    if client is a sun4:
	server# set SKIP=1
	server# set KARCH=SUN4
    else
	server# set SKIP=0
	server# set KARCH=SUN4C
    server# dd if=boot of=/tftpboot/boot.sparc.OpenBSD.$KARCH skip=$SKIP bs=32
    server# cd /tftpboot
    server# ln -s boot.sparc.OpenBSD.$KARCH 8273900B.$KARCH


After the boot program has been loaded into memory and given control by
the PROM, it starts locating the machine's remote root directory through
the BOOTPARAM protocol. First a BOOTPARAM WHOAMI request is broadcast
on the local net. The answer to this request (if it comes in) contains
the client's name. This name is used in next step, a BOOTPARAM GETFILE
request -- sent to the server that responded to the WHOAMI request --
requesting the name and address of the machine that will serve the client's
root directory, as well as the path of the client's root on that server.

Finally, this information (if it comes in) is used to issue a REMOTE MOUNT
request to the client's root filesystem server, asking for an NFS file
handle corresponding to the root filesystem. If successful, the boot
program starts reading from the remote root filesystem in search of the
kernel which is then read into memory.

You will want export the miniroot{:--:}OSrev.fs filesystem to the client.  You
can dd this filesystem image to some spare partition, mount and export
that partition or use tar to copy the contents to a more convenient spot.

Alternatively you can build a bootable partition from the distribution sets
as follows:

Unpack `base{:--:}OSrev.tgz' and `etc{:--:}OSrev.tgz' on the server in the root directory
for your target machine. If you elect to use a separately NFS-mounted
filesystem for `/usr' with your diskless setup, make sure the "./usr" base
files in base{:--:}OSrev.tgz end up in the correct location. One way to do this is
to temporarily use a loopback mount on the server, re-routing <root>/usr to
your server's exported OpenBSD "/usr" directory. Also put the kernel and
the install/upgrade scripts into the root directory.

A few configuration files need to be edited:

	<root>/etc/hosts
		Add the IP addresses of both server and client.

	<root>/etc/myname
		This files contains the client's hostname; use the same
		name as in <root>/etc/hosts.

	<root>/etc/fstab
		Enter the entries for the remotely mounted filesystems.
		For example:
			server:/export/root/client       /     nfs  rw 0 0
			server:/export/exec/sun4.OpenBSD /usr  nfs  rw 0 0

Now you must populate the the `/dev' directory for your client. If you server
runs SunOS 4.x, you can simply change your working directory to `<root>/dev'
and run the MAKEDEV script: `sh MAKEDEV all'.

On SunOS 5.x systems, MAKEDEV can also be used, but there'll be error
messages about unknown user and groups. These errors are inconsequential
for the purpose of installing OpenBSD. However, you may want to correct them
if you plan to the diskless setup regularly. In that case, you may re-run
MAKEDEV on your OpenBSD machine once it has booted.
