OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV should work on all Athlon 64-based and
compatible designs.

OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV supports most SMP (Symmetrical MultiProcessor)
systems.  To support SMP operation, a separate SMP kernel (bsd.mp)
is included with the installation file sets.

OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV supports both UEFI/GPT booting and BIOS/MBR
booting.

Please refer to the website for a full list of supported hardware.
