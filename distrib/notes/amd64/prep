First and foremost, before beginning the installation process, MAKE
SURE YOU HAVE A RELIABLE BACKUP of any data on your hard disk that you
wish to keep.  Repartitioning your hard disk is an excellent way to
destroy important data.

If you plan to dual boot, use the other operating system's "fdisk" program
or partition editor to create at least one of the partitions to be used for
that operating system.  If that operating system is already set up to use the
entire disk, you will have to back it up, remove and recreate a smaller
partition for it, and then restore the data from that partition.  You do not
have to create an OpenBSD partition at this time, the OpenBSD installation
will give you an opportunity to create the partition needed for OpenBSD.

Your hard disk is now prepared to have OpenBSD installed on it, and
you should proceed with the installation instructions.
