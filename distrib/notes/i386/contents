	cdbr		First-stage CD bootstrap (boot sector), which loads
			the cdboot second-stage bootstrap.  This file is
			included in the cd{:--:}OSrev.iso image, and is provided as
			a convenience, but will rarely be needed.

	cdboot		Second-stage CD bootstrap loader for non-emulation
			OpenBSD El Torito CD-ROMs. It processes boot.conf
			then loads the bsd.rd installation ramdisk kernel.
			This file is included in the cd{:--:}OSrev.iso image, and is
			provided as a convenience, but will rarely be needed.

	cdemu{:--:}OSrev.iso	Another bootable CD-ROM image, for older systems
			where the BIOS only supports the ``large floppy
			emulation'' mode for bootable CD-ROMs, and which
			are therefore unable to boot cd{:--:}OSrev.iso.  This image
			is provided as a convenience, but should rarely be
			needed.
