OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV works across a broad range of standard PCs and
clones, with a wide variety of processors and I/O bus architectures.  It
can be expected to install and run with minimal difficulties on most
current products.  The cases where problems may be encountered are
typically older proprietary PCs, laptops, or specialized server boxes
that rely on a custom BIOS to paper over implementation differences.

OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV supports most SMP (Symmetrical MultiProcessor)
systems.  To support SMP operation, a separate SMP kernel (bsd.mp)
is included with the installation file sets.

The minimal configuration to install the system is 32MB of RAM and
at least 200MB of disk space to accomodate the `base' and `etc' sets.
To install the entire system, at least 600MB of disk are required,
and to run X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.

Please refer to the website for a full list of support hardware.

To be detected by the distributed kernels, some ISA devices must
be configured with specific settings.  Here's their list:
