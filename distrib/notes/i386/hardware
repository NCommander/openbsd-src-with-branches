OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on ISA (AT-Bus), EISA, PCI, and VL-bus systems
with 386-family processors, with or without math coprocessors.  It
does NOT support MCA systems, such as some IBM PS/2 systems.  The
minimal configuration is said to require 4M of RAM and 50M of disk space,
though we do not know of anyone running with a system quite this minimal today.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run X
or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (4M of RAM will
actually allow you to run X and/or compile, but it won't be speedy.
Note that until you have around 16M of RAM, getting more RAM is more
important than getting a faster CPU.)

Supported devices {:-include-:}:
	Floppy controllers.

Drivers for hardware marked with "[*]" are NOT included on the
distribution floppies.  Except as noted above, all other drivers are
present on install floppy.  Also, at the present time, the
distributed kernels support only one SCSI host adapter per machine.
OpenBSD normally allows more, though, so if you have more than one, you
can use all of them by compiling a custom kernel once OpenBSD is
installed.

Support for devices marked with "[+]" IS included in the "generic" kernels,
although it is not in the kernel on the installation floppy.


Hardware the we do NOT currently support, but get many questions
about:
	NCR 5380-based SCSI host adapters.
	QIC-40 and QIC-80 tape drives.  (Those are the tape drives
		that connect to the floppy disk controller.)
	Multiprocessor Pentium and Pentium Pro systems.  (Though they should
		run fine using one processor only.)

We are planning future support for many of these devices.

To be detected by the distributed kernels, the devices must
be configured as follows:

SPECIAL CARE FOR SMC ULTRA ELITE
--------------------------------


Note for SMC Elite Ultra ethernet card users:  The Elite Ultra is very
sensitive to how its I/O port is treated.  Mistreating it can cause
a number of effects -- everything from the card not responding when the
kernel probes, or the soft configuration being corrupted or wiped completely.

By default, the kernel ships with device we1 configured for the 'default'
Elite Ultra locations, comprising of port 0x300, irq 10, and memory location
0xcc000.  This matches a hard coded jumper on the board as well a common
soft config setting.

Unfortunately, the kernel's autconfiguration process (specifically, some
of the devices it probes for) cause conflicts with the SMC Elite Ultra, and
very often cause it to lose its configuration and fail its own probe.
If this happens, you must boot the computer into DOS, and run the EzSetup
program from SMC (if you do not have a copy on the floppy
accompanying your board, the complete URL to download the program is 
ftp://ftp.smc.com/pub/nics/ethernet/elite_ultra/gez122.exe).  This program
will allow you to reconfigure and recover a card that has lost its
configuration with a minimum of hassle.

In order to avoid blowing away the card, one *must* use the run-time kernel
configuration system when booting the Install kernel.  This is done by
giving the -c flag to the initial boot request.  Following the loading of
the kernel, the user is presented with a

UKC>

prompt.  At this prompt, as variety of commands may be issued, but the
relevant one to getting the SMC Elite Ultra running is 'disable'.  The
wt0, el0, and ie1 devices all need to be disabled.  This is done by typing
'disable' followed by the name of the device, i.e., 'disable wt0', and
pressing return.

If, for some reason, your Elite Ultra is not configured at the 'default'
location the kernel is expecting it, you may also use the 'change' command
in the UKC system to modify where the kernel will look for it.  Typing
'change we1' will allow you to modify those settings.  Note that running the
card at an i/o port of anything other then 0x300 at this point is not
recommended, and is beyond the scope of this document-- by doing so you
risk other device probes wreaking the havoc we are trying to avoid.

When all three extra devices are disabled and any changes made, the
'quit' command will exit the UKC.  The kernel should then boot, and find
your Elite Ultra on device we1.

SPECIAL CARE FOR NEWER NOTEBOOK COMPUTERS AND PCMCIA

There is a problem on some newer notebooks with OpenBSD's autoconfiguration
not YET finding the PCI<-->PCMCIA bridge, and therefore not finding any of the
PCMCIA cards, which can be a nuisance if you're trying to install over
an Ethernet LAN.

The symptoms:
1) No probe messages indicating any PCMCIA response or any probe response
   for any PCMCIA cards, and
2) A probe message like this:
	Cirrus Logic CL-GD6729 (class bridge, subclass PCMCIA, revision 0xfe)
	at pci0 dev 4 function 0 not configured
   The details will vary; the important parts are 
	class bridge, subclass PCMCIA, ... at pci* ... not configured

Finding the Bridge Address

Bear in mind that both ISA and PCI are just different ways of electrically
connecting an adaptor into the PC's memory space. PCI merely provides
convenient iterators for finding everything on it, which is easier than
it is on ISA. This is why you get the "not configured" message above.
But once a device is connected in there, the driver only needs to know its 
memory mapped address. Now we don't know its address on YOUR brand of PC,
but we can help you find it out. Someday our software will do this for you,
of course, but it doesn't as of today.

Your first try should be 0x3000, which seems to be used on several notebooks.
If this fails, you need to do some nosing around.

The easiest way is to boot up Windows '95, if you have it on a hard disk.
Right-click on the "My Computer" Icon, select Properties, select the
Device Manager tab, and double click on PCMCIA Socket, then on the Bridge
that is listed under this heading. Select Properties at the bottom of
the window, and click on Resources. Finally you will see an address range,
in Hex. On my Dell Latitude LM, for example, the range was FCFC-FCFF.

If you don't have Windows '95 on a hard disk, there are several possibilities:
1) But you do have Windows'95 setup floppies? Then look through them for
the ".INF" files, and rummage around in them until you find it.
2) You have a friend, or the dealer, who has a similar Notebook PC with
Windows '95 installed? Proceed as above.
3) Call Customer Support at the manufacturer, tell them you're having
a setup problem, and need to know the memory address to set for the
PCI to PCMCIA bridge. Oh, take a few cans of Jolt and a good book to read
while waiting on the line.

Fixing it - temporarily

OK, now you have the address and size of the memory window for the PCMCIA
bridge. Or so you think. To try it out, use the UKC, as described earlier
(under SMC Elite, above). Basically you use "boot -c" to get into UKC.
Give the command "change pcicmaster0", and to set the address and iosize
to the values you found above. Then type "quit", and the boot should
continue, and you should find your PCMCIA cards.

Note that if the card is an "ep0" (3c589 on PCMCIA) AND you are using
UTP, you must give the arguments "link0 link1" on the ifconfig command.
The autoconfig message
	ep0 at pcmcia0 port 0x300-0x30f irq 10: ep0: address nn:nn:nn:nn:nn:nn,
		utp/aui/bnc (default utp)
implies that the default is UTP and you can omit the link* arguments, but
in fact you cannot!

Fixing it - configuring a new kernel

Follow the normal steps for building a new kernel documented elsewhere.
For my system I changed the original pcicmaster0 line as follows:

#pcicmaster0	at isa? port 0x3E0 size 2
#hack for CL PCIC on Dell Lattitude LM; really on PCI, but...
pcicmaster0	at isa? port 0xFCFC size 4

IRQ's: You probably do NOT have to worry about the IRQ's appearing
different than what Windows'95 claims. Trust me, and try it.

Fixing it for good

OK, this is the tough part. Somebody has to wade in and rewrite the
OpenBSD PCMCIA subsystem to support multiple adapters on multiple busses.
Nobody's done this yet. You have the source, so you truly can
"Use The Source, Luke."
