OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV works across a broad range of standard PCs and
clones, with a wide variety of processors and I/O bus architectures.  It
can be expected to install and run with minimal difficulties on most
current products.  The cases where problems may be encountered are
typically older proprietary PCs, laptops, or specialized server boxes
that rely on a custom BIOS to paper over implementation differences.

OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV supports most SMP (Symmetrical MultiProcessor)
systems.  To support SMP operation, a separate SMP kernel (bsd.mp)
is included with the installation file sets.

The minimal configuration to install the system is 12MB or 16MB of RAM and
perhaps 100MB of disk space.  A custom kernel might be able to run with only
8MB.  To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (16MB of RAM will actually
allow you to run X and/or compile but it won't be speedy. Note that until
you have around 32MB of RAM, getting more RAM is more important than getting
a faster CPU.)

Supported hardware {:-include-:}:
	Processors
		All CPU chips compatible with the Intel 80386 (MACHINE)
		architecture:
			386/486 (SX/DX/DX2/DX4, an FPU is required)
			Intel Pentium/Pentium-MMX
			Intel Pentium Pro/II/III/Celeron/Xeon
			Intel Pentium IV
			AMD 6x86
			AMD K5/K6/K6-2/K6-3
			AMD Athlon/Duron
			Cyrix MediaGX/M1/M2

			IDT WinChip
			NexGen 586
			NS Geode GX1
			Transmeta TMS3200, TMS5400, TMS5600
		Everything that is a clone of the 386 or up should work
		fine. The only CPU that is known to work poorly (due to
		flawed motherboard designs) is the Cyrix 386DLC.
	Buses

		including:

			 they are the hardest to support)
		Both 16-bit PCMCIA Cards and newer 32-bit CardBus
		support
		Universal Serial Bus (USB)
		Inter IC (I2C) bus
		The MCA bus found in various IBM PS/2 machines is not

Drivers for hardware marked with [G] are only included in the GENERIC
kernels, but are NOT included on the various distribution floppies
(including the CD-ROM boot image).
Drivers for hardware marked with [A] are not included in floppy A.
Drivers for hardware marked with [B] are not included in floppy B.
Drivers for hardware marked with [C] are not included in floppy C.
Support for devices marked with [*] is not included in the GENERIC kernel,
and will require you to compile a custom kernel to enable it.


Hardware that we do NOT currently support, but get many questions
about:
	The "Micro Channel" MCA bus used in many IBM PS/2 models
	NCR 5380-based and 53400-based SCSI host adapters
	QIC-40 and QIC-80 tape drives (these are the tape drives
		that connect to the floppy disk controller)
	Multiprocessor motherboards (though they will run fine using
		one processor only)
	Sony and Panasonic proprietary CD-ROM interfaces
	Parallel-port ZIP drives (SCSI and ATAPI ZIP drives work fine)
	Intel i82556 (EtherExpress PRO/100A) and i82596 (EtherExpress
		PRO/10 PCI) Ethernet adapters
	Hewlett-Packard PC-LAN+ (HP27xxx) Ethernet adapters
	Aureal Vortex sound cards
	Winmodems
	Infrared devices, such as commonly found on laptops
	Firewire
	Mylex and Intel RAID controllers
	PCMCIA:
		Memory cards
		Most multifunction cards

We are planning future support for many of these devices.

To be detected by the distributed kernels, some devices must
be configured with specific settings.  Here's their list:

PCI Ethernet boards need to have an interrupt, either assigned in your
PCI BIOS, or autoconfigured.

Hardware not listed in the above table doesn't need any specific
configuration.


Special care for PCI BIOS:

	As with all BIOS implementations and subsystems this one has bugs
	too.
	Sometimes specifications are unclear about interfaces and/or data
	validation.
	These all cause our driver for PCI BIOS to misbehave in more or
	less fatal ways, such as panics on pcibios0 configuration or PCI
	device attachments, or unconfigured PCI devices due to IRQ and/or
	I/O address misconfiguration.

	Fast workaround

	Boot by giving the -c flag to the initial boot request.
	Following the loading of the kernel, the user is presented with a

	UKC>

	Then type the following commands:

	UKC> change bios0
	165 bios0 at mainbus0 bus -1 flags 0x0
	change [n] y
	bus [-1] ? <enter>
	flags [0] ? 3
	165 bios0 changed
	165 bios0 at mainbus0 bus -1 flags 0x3
	UKC> quit

	This will disable the pcibios0 attachment.
	Sometimes, especially when hangs occur on particular PCI device
	attachments, moving PCI cards into a different slot helps.

	Fixing for good

	Try to gather dmesg output from the failing configuration, for
	example by using a serial console (see boot(8)), and send it to
	<mickey@OpenBSD.org> along with descriptions of your hardware setup.
	Alternatively, dig in the code and fix problems.
