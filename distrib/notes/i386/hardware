OpenBSD/i386 2.2 runs on ISA (AT-Bus), EISA, PCI, and VL-bus systems
with 386-family processors, with or without math coprocessors.  It
does NOT support MCA systems, such as some IBM PS/2 systems.  The
minimal configuration is said to require 4M of RAM and 50M of disk space,
though we do not know of anyone running with a system quite this minimal today.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run X
or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (4M of RAM will
actually allow you to run X and/or compile, but it won't be speedy.
Note that until you have around 16M of RAM, getting more RAM is more
important than getting a faster CPU.)

Supported devices include:
	Floppy controllers.
	MFM, ESDI, IDE, and RLL hard disk controllers.
	SCSI host adapters:
		Adaptec AHA-154xA, -B, -C, and -CF 
		Adaptec AHA-174x
		Adaptec AIC-6260 and AIC-6360 based boards, including
			the Adaptec AHA-152x and the SoundBlaster SCSI
			host adapter.  (Note that you cannot boot from
			these boards if they do not have a boot ROM;
			only the AHA-152x and motherboards using this chip
			are likely to be bootable, consequently.)
		Adaptec AHA-294x[W] cards and some onboard PCI designs using
			the AIC7870 chip.  The 2940AU is known not to perform
			very well with this driver.
		Adaptec AHA-394x[W] cards; two AIC7870 chips with an on-board
			PCI to PCI bridge.
		Adaptec AIC-7770-based SCSI host adapters (including the
			Adaptec AHA-274x, AHA-284x families).
		WD-7000 SCSI host adapters.
		Buslogic 54x (Adaptec AHA-154x clones; driver on kcadp floppy)
		BusLogic 445, 74x, 9xx  (But not the new "FlashPoint" series
			of BusLogic SCSI adapters)
		Symbios Logic (NCR) 53C8xx-based PCI SCSI host adapters
		Ultrastor 14f, 34f, and (possibly) 24f
		Seagate/Future Domain ISA SCSI adapter cards, including
			ST01/02
			Future Domain TMC-885
			Future Domain TMC-950
	MDA, CGA, VGA, SVGA, and HGC Display Adapters.  (Note that not
		all of the display adapters OpenBSD/i386 can work with
		are supported by X.  See the XFree86 FAQ for more

Drivers for hardware marked with "[*]" are NOT included on the
distribution floppies.  Except as noted above, all other drivers are
present on install floppy.  Also, at the present time, the
distributed kernels support only one SCSI host adapter per machine.
OpenBSD normally allows more, though, so if you have more than one, you
can use all of them by compiling a custom kernel once OpenBSD is
installed.

Support for devices marked with "[+]" IS included in the "generic" kernels,
although it is not in the kernel on the installation floppy.


Hardware the we do NOT currently support, but get many questions
about:
	NCR 5380-based SCSI host adapters.
	QIC-40 and QIC-80 tape drives.  (Those are the tape drives
		that connect to the floppy disk controller.)
	Multiprocessor Pentium and Pentium Pro systems.  (Though they should
		run fine using one processor only.)

We are planning future support for many of these devices.

To be detected by the distributed kernels, the devices must
be configured as follows:

SPECIAL CARE FOR SMC ULTRA ELITE
--------------------------------


Note for SMC Elite Ultra ethernet card users:  The Elite Ultra is very
sensitive to how it's i/o port is treated.  Mistreating it can cause
a number of effects -- everything from the card not responding when the
kernel probes, or the soft configuration being corrupted or wiped completely.

By default, the kernel ships with device ed2 configured for the 'default'
Elite Ultra locations, comprising of port 0x300, irq 10, and memory location
0xcc000.  This matches a hard coded jumper on the board as well a common
soft config setting.

Unfortunately, the kernel's autconfiguration process (specifically, some
of the devices it probes for) cause conflicts with the SMC Elite Ultra, and
very often cause it to lose it's configuration and fail it's own probe.
If thise happens, you must boot the computer into DOS, and run the EzSetup
program available from SMC.  The complete URL of which is 
ftp://ftp.smc.com/pub/nics/ethernet/elite_ultra/gez122.exe.  This program
will allow you to reconfigure and recover a card that has lost it's
configuration with a minimum of hassle.

In order to avoid blowing away the card, one *must* use the run-time kernel
configuration system when booting the Install kernel.  This is done by
giving the -c flag to the initial boot request.  Following the loading of
the kernel, the user is presented with a

UKC>

prompt.  At this prompt, as variety of commands may be issued, but the
relevant one to getting the SMC Elite Ultra running is 'disable'.  The
wt0, el0, and ie1 devices all need to be disabled.  This is done by typing
'disable' followed by the name of the device, i.e., 'disable wt0', and
pressing return.

If, for some reason, your Elite Ultra is not configured at the 'default'
location the kernel is expecting it, you may also use the 'change' command
in the UKC system to modify where the kernel will look for it.  Typing
'change ed2' will allow you to modify those settings.  Note that running the
card at an i/o port of anything other then 0x300 at this point is not
recommended, and is beyond the scope of this document-- by doing so you
risk other device probes wreaking the havoc we are trying to avoid.

When all three extra devices are disabled and any changes made, the
'quit' command will exit the UKC.  The kernel should then boot, and find
your Elite Ultra on device ed2.
