OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV works across a broad range of standard PC's and
clones, with a wide variety of processors and I/O bus architectures.  It
can be expected to install and run with minimal difficulties on most
current products.  The cases where problems may be encountered are
typically older proprietary PC's, Laptops or specialized server boxes
that rely on a custom BIOS to paper over implementation differences.

OpenBSD does not currently support multiple processors (SMP), but will
run using one processor on a multi-processor system board.

The minimal configuration to install the system is 6M or 8M of RAM and
perhaps 60M of disk space.  A custom kernel might be able to run
with only 4MB, though we do not know of anyone running with a system
quite this minimal today.  To install the entire system requires
much more disk space, and to run X or compile the system, more RAM
is recommended.  (8M of RAM will actually allow you to run X and/or
compile but it won't be speedy.  Note that until you have around 16M
of RAM, getting more RAM is more important than getting a faster CPU.)
 
Supported hardware {:-include-:}:
	Processors
		All CPU chips compatible with the Intel 80386 (i386)
		architecture:

			 they are the hardest to support))
		Both 16-bit PCMCIA Cards and newer 32-bit CardBus
		support
		Universal Serial Bus (USB)
		The MCA bus found in various IBM PS/2 machines is not
		supported.
	Bus Interfaces

Drivers for hardware marked with "[*]" are NOT included on the
distribution floppies.  Except as noted above, all other drivers are
present on install floppy.  Also, at the present time, the
distributed kernels support only one SCSI host adapter per machine.
OpenBSD normally allows more, though, so if you have more than one, you
can use all of them by compiling a custom kernel once OpenBSD is
installed.

Support for devices marked with "[+]" IS included in the "generic" kernels,
although it is not in the kernel on the installation floppy.


Hardware the we do NOT currently support, but get many questions
about:
	The "Micro Channel" MCA bus used in many IBM PS/2 models
	NCR 5380-based and 53400-based SCSI host adapters
	QIC-40 and QIC-80 tape drives (these are the tape drives
		that connect to the floppy disk controller)
	Multiprocessor motherboards (though they will run fine using
		one processor only)
	Sony and Panasonic proprietary CD-ROM interfaces
	Parallel-port ZIP drives (SCSI and ATAPI ZIP drives work fine)
	Intel i82556 (EtherExpress PRO/100A) and i82596 (EtherExpress
		PRO/10 PCI) Ethernet adapters
	Hewlett-Packard PC-LAN+ (HP27xxx) Ethernet adapters
	SoundBlaster Live! (EMU10k1) sound devices
	Aureal Vortex sound cards
	Winmodems
	Infrared devices, such as commonly found on laptops
	Firewire
	Mylex and Intel RAID controllers
	PCMCIA:
		Memory cards
		Most multifunction cards

We are planning future support for many of these devices.

To be detected by the distributed kernels, some devices must
be configured with specific settings.  Here's their list:

PCI ethernet boards need to have an interrupt, either assigned in your
PCI BIOS, or autoconfigured.

Hardware not listed in the above table doesn't need any specific
configuration.


SPECIAL CARE FOR SMC ULTRA ELITE
--------------------------------


Note for SMC Elite Ultra ethernet card users:  The Elite Ultra is very
sensitive to how its I/O port is treated.  Mistreating it can cause
a number of effects -- everything from the card not responding when the
kernel probes, or the soft configuration being corrupted or wiped completely.

By default, the kernel ships with device we1 configured for the 'default'
Elite Ultra locations, comprising of port 0x300, irq 10, and memory location
0xcc000.  This matches a hard coded jumper on the board as well a common
soft config setting.

Unfortunately, the kernel's autoconfiguration process (specifically, some
of the devices it probes for) cause conflicts with the SMC Elite Ultra, and
very often cause it to lose its configuration and fail its own probe.
If this happens, you must boot the computer into DOS, and run the EzSetup
program from SMC (if you do not have a copy on the floppy
accompanying your board, the complete URL to download the program is 
ftp://ftp.smc.com/pub/nics/ethernet/elite_ultra/gez122.exe).  This program
will allow you to reconfigure and recover a card that has lost its
configuration with a minimum of hassle.

In order to avoid blowing away the card, one *must* use the run-time kernel
configuration system when booting the Install kernel.  This is done by
giving the -c flag to the initial boot request.  Following the loading of
the kernel, the user is presented with a

UKC>

prompt.  At this prompt, a variety of commands may be issued, but the
relevant one to getting the SMC Elite Ultra running is 'disable'.  The
wt0, el0, and ie1 devices all need to be disabled.  This is done by typing
'disable' followed by the name of the device, i.e., 'disable wt0', and
pressing return.

If, for some reason, your Elite Ultra is not configured at the 'default'
location the kernel is expecting it, you may also use the 'change' command
in the UKC system to modify where the kernel will look for it.  Typing
'change we1' will allow you to modify those settings.  Note that running the
card at an i/o port of anything other then 0x300 at this point is not
recommended, and is beyond the scope of this document-- by doing so you
risk other device probes wreaking the havoc we are trying to avoid.

When all three extra devices are disabled and any changes made, the
'quit' command will exit the UKC.  The kernel should then boot, and find
your Elite Ultra on device we1.

SPECIAL CARE FOR PCI BIOS
 
As all BIOS implementations and subsystems this one has bugs too.
Sometimes specifications are unclear about interfaces and/or
data validation.
These all cause our driver for PCI BIOS to misbehave in more or
less fatal ways, such as panics on pcibios0 configuration or
pci device attachments, or unconfigured pci devices due to
irq and/or I/O address misconfiguration.

Fast workaround

Boot by giving the -c flag to the initial boot request.
Following the loading of the kernel, the user is presented with a

UKC>

Then type the following commands:

UKC> change bios0
165 bios0 at mainbus0 bus -1 flags 0x0
change [n] y
bus [-1] ? <enter>
flags [0] ? 3
165 bios0 changed
165 bios0 at mainbus0 bus -1 flags 0x3
UKC> quit

This will disable the pcibios0 attachment.
Sometimes, especially when hangs occur on particular pci device
attachments, moving pci cards into a different slot helps.

Fixing for good

Try to gather dmesg output from the failing configuration, for
example by using serial console (see boot(8)) and send it to
mickey@openbsd.org along with descriptions of your hardware setup.
Dig in the code and fix problems.
