Installation is supported from several media types, including:

	DOS partitions
	FFS partitions
	EXT2 partitions
	Tape
	FTP
	HTTP

If you can't (or don't want to) boot off the CD-ROM, you'll need to have
a floppy disk (1.44MB required).

The floppy installation allows installing OpenBSD directly from FTP
mirror sites over the internet, however you must consider the speed and
reliability of your internet connection for this option.  It may save
much time and frustration to use ftp get/reget to transfer the
distribution sets to a local server or disk and perform the installation
from there, rather than directly from the internet.


Creating a bootable floppy disk using DOS/Windows:

	First you need to get access to the OpenBSD bootable floppy
	images. If you can access the distribution from the CD-ROM under 
	DOS, you will find the bootable disks in the OSREV/MACHINE 
	directory. Otherwise, you will have to download them from one of 
	the OpenBSD ftp or http mirror sites, using an ftp client or a web 
	browser. In either case, take care to do "binary" transfers, since 
	these are images files and any DOS cr/lf translations or control/z 
	EOF interpretations will result in corrupted transfers.
	
	You will also need to go to the "tools" directory and grab a
	copy of the rawrite.exe utility and its documentation.  This
	program is needed to correctly copy the bootable filesystem
	image to the floppy, since it's an image of a unix partition
	containing a ffs filesystem, not a MSDOS format diskette.

	Once you have installed rawrite.exe, just run it and specify the
	name of the bootable image, such as "floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs" and the name of
	the floppy drive, such as "a:".  Be sure to use good quality HD
	(1.44MB) floppies, formatted on the system you're using.  The
	image copy and boot process is not especially tolerant of read
	errors. 

	Note that if you are using NT to write the images to disk, you
	will need to use ntrw.exe instead.  It is also available in the
	"tools" directory.  Grab it and run in with the correct 
	arguments like this "ntrw <image> <drive>:"

	Note that, when installing, the boot floppy can be write-protected
	(i.e.  read-only).


Creating a bootable floppy disk using SunOS or other Un*x-like system:

	First, you will need obtain a local copy of the bootable filesystem
	image as described above.  If possible use the cksum(1) or md5(1) 
	commands to verify the checksums of the images vs. the values in 
	the CKSUM or MD5 files on the mirror site.

	Next, use the dd(1) utility to copy the file to the floppy drive.
	Under SunOS, the command would be:

		dd if=floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs of=/dev/rfd0c bs=36b

	If you are using something other than SunOS, you may have to adapt
	this to conform to local naming conventions for the floppy and
	options suitable for copying to a "raw" floppy image.  The key
	issue is that the device name used for the floppy *must* be one
	that refers to the correct block device, not a partition or
	compatibility mode, and the copy command needs to be compatible
	with the requirement that writes to a raw device must be in
	multiples of 512-byte blocks.  The variations are endless and
	beyond the scope of this document.

	If you're doing this on the system you intend to boot the floppy on,
	copying the floppy back to a file and doing a compare or checksum
	is a good way to verify that the floppy is readable and free of
	read/write errors.


Creating an installation tape:

	While you won't be able to boot OpenBSD from a tape, you can use
	one to provide the installation sets.  To do so, you need to make
	a tape that contains the distribution set files, each in "tar"
	format or in "gzipped tar format".  First you will need to
	transfer the distribution sets to your local system, using ftp or
	by mounting the CD-ROM containing the release.  Then you need to
	make a tape containing the files.

	If you're making the tape on a UN*X-like system, the easiest way
	to do so is make a shell script along the following lines, call it
	"/tmp/maketape".

	#! /bin/sh
	tape=/dev/nrst0
	mt -f ${tape} rewind
	for file in base etc comp game man misc xbase xfont xlink xserv xshare
	do
		dd if=${file}OSrev.tgz of=${tape} obs=8k conv=sync
	done
	tar cf ${tape} bsd
	mt -f ${tape} offline
	# end of script


	And then:

	cd .../OSREV/MACHINE
	sh -x /tmp/maketape

	
	If you're using a system other than OpenBSD or SunOS, the tape
	name and other requirements may change.


If you are upgrading OpenBSD, you also have the option of installing
OpenBSD by putting the new distribution sets somewhere in your existing
file system, and using them from there.  To do that, you must do the
following:

	Place the distribution sets you wish to upgrade somewhere in
	your current file system tree.  At a bare minimum, you must
	upgrade the "base" binary distribution, and so must put the
	"base{:--:}OSrev" set somewhere in your file system.  If you wish,
	you can do the other sets, as well, but you should NOT upgrade
	the "etc" distribution; the "etc" distribution contains system
	configuration files that you should review and update by hand.

	Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next step in
	the upgrade process, actually upgrading your system.
