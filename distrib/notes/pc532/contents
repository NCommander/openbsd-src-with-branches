The binary distribution consists of the following files:

	base.tar.gz
		The NetBSD/pc532 1.0 base binary distribution.  You
		MUST install this distribution set.  It contains the
		base NetBSD utilities that are necessary for the
		system to run and be minimally functional.  It
		excludes everything described below.
		[ 15.1M gzipped ]

	comp.tar.gz
		The NetBSD/pc532 Compiler tools.  All of the tools
		relating to C, C++, and FORTRAN (yes, there are two!).
		This set includes the system include files
		(/usr/include), the linker, the compiler tool chain,
		and the various system libraries.  This set also includes
		the manual pages for all the utilities it contains, as well
		as the system call and library manual pages.
		[ 4.2M gzipped ]

	etc.tar.gz
		This distribution set contains the system
		configuration files that reside in /etc and in several
		other places.  This set MUST be installed if you are
		installing the system from scratch, but should NOT be
		used if you are upgrading.  (If you are upgrading,
		it's recommended that you get a copy of this set and
		CAREFULLY upgrade your configuration files by hand.)
		[ 50K gzipped ]

	games.tar.gz
		This set includes the games and their manual pages.
		[ 2.4M gzipped ]

	man.tar.gz
		This set includes all of the manual pages for the
		binaries and other software contained in the base set.
		Note that it does not include any of the manual pages
		that are included in the other sets.
		[ 0.7M gzipped ]

	misc.tar.gz
		This set includes the system dictionaries (which are
		rather large), the typesettable document set, and
		man pages for other architectures which happen to be
		installed from the source tree by default.
		[ 1.7M gzipped, 5.6M uncompressed ]

	text.tar.gz
		This set includes NetBSD's text processing tools,
		including groff, all related programs, and their
		manual pages.
		[ 1.1M gzipped ]

The pc532 distribution set does not include a security distribution.
If you are in the US and want the security distribution you must
get the security source distribution and recompile libcrypt.a and
recompile the following programs:
	ed, ftpd, makekey, rexecd, uucpd, init, lock, login, passwd,
	skeyinit, su, tn3270, pppd


The initial installation process on a pc532 without NetBSD/pc532
is supported by the following files:

	Initial kernels to loaded into memory and run:

	  netbsd.rd.9600.gz	"ram disk" root kernel, 9600 baud
	  netbsd.rd.19200.gz	"ram disk" root kernel, 19200 baud

	The initial root file system for the above kernels

	  ram.root.gz		Ram root disk

	Utility programs for helping with the install after a
	mini-root has been built on a hard disk

	  util.tar.gz		things to help the install

	Bootable kernels for placement in the file system to boot
	from hard disk.
