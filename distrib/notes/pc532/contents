The initial installation process on a pc532 without OpenBSD/pc532
is supported by the following files:

	Initial file system used via SCSI floppy or downloaded into 
	memory:

	inst-OSrev.fs	-- file system containing boot loader 
			   and install kernel with 2MB
			   ram root file system.

	download.c	-- source for the program to download
			   inst-23.fs into memory via the
			   pc532 ROM monitor.


The upgrade process is supported by having a copy of a 2. kernel
available.  This file is:

	bsd.default.gz		-- a kernel produced from the DEFAULT
				   configuration file in pc532/conf.
