The pc532-specific portion of the OpenBSD 2.0 release is found in the
"pc532" subdirectory of the distribution.  That subdirectory contains
the files as follows:

.../2.0/pc532/

	INSTALL.pc532		Installation notes; this file.
	inst-20.fs.gz		Installation file system.
	download.c.gz		Source for a pc532 ROM compat download pgm
	bsd.default.gz		Upgrade kernel
	base.tar.gz		base distribution
	comp.tar.gz		compiler tools & libraries
	etc.tar.gz		files for /etc
	games.tar.gz		/usr/games and friends
	man.tar.gz		/usr/man
	misc.tar.gz		various
	text.tar.gz		groff and friends


The binary distribution consists of the following files:

	base.tar.gz
		The OpenBSD/pc532 2.0 base binary distribution.  You
		MUST install this distribution set.  It contains the
		base OpenBSD utilities that are necessary for the
		system to run and be minimally functional.  It
		excludes everything described below.
		[ 6.8M gzipped ]

	comp.tar.gz
		The OpenBSD/pc532 Compiler tools.  All of the tools
		relating to C, C++, and FORTRAN (yes, there are two!).
		This set includes the system include files
		(/usr/include), the linker, the compiler tool chain,
		and the various system libraries.  This set also includes
		the manual pages for all the utilities it contains, as well
		as the system call and library manual pages.
		[ 4.7M gzipped ]

	etc.tar.gz
		This distribution set contains the system
		configuration files that reside in /etc and in several
		other places.  This set MUST be installed if you are
		installing the system from scratch, but should NOT be
		used if you are upgrading.  (If you are upgrading,
		it's recommended that you get a copy of this set and
		CAREFULLY upgrade your configuration files by hand.)
		[ 63K gzipped ]

	games.tar.gz
		This set includes the games and their manual pages.
		[ 2.8M gzipped ]

	man.tar.gz
		This set includes all of the manual pages for the
		binaries and other software contained in the base set.
		Note that it does not include any of the manual pages
		that are included in the other sets.
		[ 0.8M gzipped ]

	misc.tar.gz
		This set includes the system dictionaries (which are
		rather large), the typesettable document set, and
		man pages for other architectures which happen to be
		installed from the source tree by default.
		[ 1.9M gzipped ]

	text.tar.gz
		This set includes OpenBSD's text processing tools,
		including groff, all related programs, and their
		manual pages.
		[ 0.8M gzipped ]


The initial installation process on a pc532 without OpenBSD/pc532
is supported by the following files:

	Initial file system used via SCSI floppy or downloaded into 
	memory:

	inst-20.fs	-- file system containing boot loader 
			   and install kernel with 2MB
			   ram root file system.

	download.c	-- source for the program to download
			   inst-20.fs into memory via the
			   pc532 ROM monitor.


The upgrade process is supported by having a copy of a 2.0 kernel
available.  This file is:

	bsd.default.gz		-- a kernel produced from the DEFAULT
				   configuration file in pc532/conf.
