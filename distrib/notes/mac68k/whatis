OpenBSD 2.3 is the third release of OpenBSD for Macintosh
computers.  As always, there is much to be done on this 
architecture, and help is very much appreciated.  However,
a wide variety of hardware and software is completely
functional making the system an excellent answer to the question
of a UN*X-like operating system for the Mac 680x0 line of
computers.
