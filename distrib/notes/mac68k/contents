		bsd.tgz		The OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV kernel binary.
				You MUST install either this file or
				bsd-sbc.tgz below. It is the kernel
				that you need to boot the system.

		bsd-sbc.tgz	Another OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV kernel binary.
				This is identical in every way to
				bsd.tgz except that it enables a
				different SCSI driver which may allow
				some otherwise incompatible SCSI disks to
				function with OpenBSD/MACHINE.  You must
				install either this or bsd.tgz.

		utils/		The MACHINE installation utilities for MacOS.

The directory '../OSREV/MACHINE/utils' contains a number of utilities for the
MacOS to aid the installation and configuration of OpenBSD.  The files are
distributed in Macintosh BinHex format, which is used to make SEA (Self-
Extracting Archive) files, which are then used to make the executables.  The
files in this directory are as follows:

	Booter1.11.3.sea.hqx
		 This MacOS program is used to load the OpenBSD kernel and
		 start the operating system.  In all cases, you will need to
		 download this file.

	Installer_1.3.sea.hqx
		 This is the MacOS program used to install downloaded sets
		 (such as those from the bins directory) onto a BSD partition.
		 It is necessary in either the case of a fresh install or an
		 upgrade.

	Mkfs_1.47.sea.hqx
		 A MacOS program to build BSD filesystems on various
		 partitions you have created (see below).  You will need this
		 if you are performing a new installation.
