OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on several of the older Macintosh computers.
8MB of RAM should be sufficient to boot and a minimal system can probably
be squeezed onto a 120MB partition by installing just the minimum sets.
To actually do much compiling or anything more interesting than
booting, more RAM and disk space is highly recommended. About 250MB will be
necessary to install all of the OpenBSD OSREV binary distribution (note that
this does not count swap space!).

A Mac OS partition is also required to install OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV and boot it,
see below.

OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV now runs on most 680x0 MacIntosh's.  Specifically, it
should work on:
	68020 with 68851 PMMU and 68881 FPU
	68030 with 68882 FPU (many Macs do not have this)
	68040 (not including the 68LC040)

The following Macintosh models are "fully" supported.  This means that at
least the SCSI controller, ADB (keyboard and mouse), and some sort of
display will function on these models.  On some of these machines, a PMMU
and/or FPU are required if they are not provided by default with the
machine.
	Mac II, Mac IIx, Mac IIcx, Mac IIci, Mac SE/30,
	Mac IIsi, Mac IIvx, Mac IIvi, Performa 600, Centris 650,
	Color Classic, Classic II, LC520, LC550, Performa 4xx,  LCII,
	LCIII, MacTV, Quadra 610, Quadra 700, Quadra 650, Quadra 800,
	Quadra 840AV, some Duo Series,
	PowerBook 180 and 180c, PB140, PB145, PB145B, PB160, PB170, PB165,
	PB165c


Supported devices on all of the above systems {:-include-:}:
	Internal SCSI bus and most SCSI tapes, hard drives, and CD-ROM
	  drives
	Internal sound -- enough to beep on some machines, anyway
	Most NuBus video cards (there have been some
	  problems with some 24-bit color cards)
	Both internal serial ports
	ADB keyboards and mice
	Ethernet cards based on the Natl. Semiconductor 8390
	  (Asante, Apple, and a few others)
	Some Ethernet cards based on the SONIC chip including internal
	  Ethernet on many of Apple's non-AV Quadras/Centrises and
	  PowerBook 500 series.
	
Some systems will boot and are usable from an external terminal
(serial tty or SL/IP):
	LC475, Performa 475, Quadra 605, Quadra 950
	Possibly others

Some systems are reportedly almost supported:
	LC/Performa575 (if 68LC040 replaced with a 68040)
	LC/Performa630 (if 68LC040 replaced with a 68040, and booted from an
	  external SCSI drive)
	PowerBook 550c (but the internal SCSI drive is not supported yet)

What isn't supported, but often asked about:
	PowerPC-based Macs.  Newer Mac PPC systems are supported by the
	  OpenBSD/macppc port.
dnl XXX I think IIfx work now...
	Machines based on Apple's IOP technology including the Mac IIfx.
	Machines based on the 68LC040 processor.  Unfortunately, the chip
	  itself contains a major bug for which no workaround is available
	  in OpenBSD.
	LCPDS Ethernet cards.
	Apple Communication Slot (CS) Ethernet cards.
	Quadra/Centris AV series' onboard MACE Ethernet.
	Floppy drive.
