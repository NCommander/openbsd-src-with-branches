	Double-click on the BSD/Mac68k Booter icon on the desktop to
	start the application.  Go to the "Booting..." entry in the
	"Options" menu, and make it point to the bsd.rd kernel on your
	Mac OS filesystem. For the Quadra 605, LC 475, Performa 475 and
	Performa 476 models it is also necessary to activate the video address
	hack. Now boot the kernel.

	You will next be asked for your terminal type.  If you are
	installing from a non-serial console, the default of "vt220"
	is correct.  If you are installing from a serial console
	you should choose the terminal type from amongst those listed.
	(If your terminal type is xterm, just use vt220.)

	Next you will have to edit or create a disk label for the disk
	OpenBSD is being installed on.  You will first be given an
	opportunity to run pdisk and create OpenBSD partitions.

	You will be issued a command prompt allowing you to modify the
	partition table.  The most common operation, and the example presented
	here, deals with the creation of partitions for OpenBSD.

	Before editing, the partition table may look like the following:

	 #:                type name              length   base     ( size )
 	 1: Apple_partition_map Apple                 63 @ 1
 	 2:      Apple_Driver43*Macintosh             54 @ 64
 	 3:      Apple_Driver43*Macintosh             74 @ 118
 	 4:       Apple_Patches Patch Partition      512 @ 192
 	 5:           Apple_HFS untitled           61440 @ 704      ( 30.0M)
 	 6:          Apple_Free Extra           17711380 @ 62144    (  8.4G)

	After editing the table, it should look like:
	 #:                type name              length   base     ( size )^M
 	 1: Apple_partition_map Apple                 63 @ 1
 	 2:      Apple_Driver43*Macintosh             54 @ 64
 	 3:      Apple_Driver43*Macintosh             74 @ 118
	 4:       Apple_Patches Patch Partition      512 @ 192
 	 5:           Apple_HFS untitled           61440 @ 704      ( 30.0M)
 	 6:     Apple_UNIX_SVR2 OpenBSD_Root     2097152 @ 62144    (  1.0G) S0 RUFS k0 /
 	 7:     Apple_UNIX_SVR2 OpenBSD_Swap      262144 @ 2159296  (128.0M) S1  SFS k0 (swap)
 	 8:     Apple_UNIX_SVR2 OpenBSD_Usr      8388608 @ 2421440  (  4.0G) S2  UFS k0 /usr
 	 9:     Apple_UNIX_SVR2 OpenBSD_Tmp      2097152 @ 10810048 (  1.0G) S2  UFS k0
	 10:     Apple_UNIX_SVR2 OpenBSD_Var      4866323 @ 12907200 (  2.3G) S2  UFS k0

	This will likely be different based on the number of partitions
	created on the disk by the Apple partition editor.
	It is _VERY_ important to not change the start, sizes, or types of
	partitions other than the ones that are to be used by OpenBSD,
	including the Apple_Driver.* and Apple_partition_map.  The pdisk
	tool will automatically adjust the Apple_Free partition.

	---
	Command (? for help): c
	First block: 62144
	Length in blocks: 2097152
	Name of partition: OpenBSD_Root
	Available partition slices for Apple_UNIX_SVR2:
  	  a   root partition
  	  b   swap partition
  	  c   do not set any bzb bits
	  g   user partition
	Other lettered values will create user partitions
	Select a slice for default bzb values: a
	---

	For the OpenBSD_Root slice, chose a bzb value of 'a', for
	OpenBSD_Swap 'b'.  For any other slice do not set any bzb value ('c')
	except for OpenBSD_Usr, which can be set to 'g'.

	OpenBSD/MACHINE can share a disk with Mac OS by using
	an HFS partitioned disk. For proper layout, the disk should be
	partitioned with Mac OS first with unused space where OpenBSD can
	be installed.

Once the installation is complete, reboot into Mac OS, and start the
BSD/Mac68k Booter again. This time, point to the OpenBSD kernel location
on its own partition. You will have to change the kernel name to "bsd"
or "bsdsbc", depending which one you have installed. Be sure to check that
the SCSI ID is correct as well.

Note that by setting the BSD/Mac68k Booter to boot automatically
after starting, and by placing an alias to the booter in the "Startup Items"
folder, one can make the Mac68k autoload OpenBSD upon startup.
