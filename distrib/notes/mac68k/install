	Double-click on the BSD/Mac68k Booter icon on the desktop to
	start the application.  Go to the "Booting..." entry in the
	"Options" menu, and make it point to the bsd.rd kernel on your
	Mac OS filesystem. For the Quadra 605, LC 475, Performa 475 and
	Performa 476 models it is also necessary to activate the video address
	hack. Now boot the kernel.

Once the installation is complete, reboot into Mac OS, and start the
BSD/Mac68k Booter again. This time, point to the OpenBSD kernel location
on its own partition. You will have to change the kernel name to "bsd"
or "bsdsbc", depending which one you have installed. Be sure to check that
the SCSI ID is correct as well.

If you wish to save your preferences, choose the "Save Preferences"
option in the "File" menu, then quit the application and restart.  Due
to a long-standing bug, the preferences will not be saved unless you
quit.  Note that by setting the BSD/Mac68k Booter to boot automatically
after starting, and by placing an alias to the booter in the "Startup Items"
folder, one can make the Mac68k autoload OpenBSD upon startup.

Before attempting to boot a kernel on machines based on the Apple's IOP
technology (i.e. Quadra 900, 950), make sure that the serial switch option
in the Control Panel is set to "off". This allows OpenBSD to use the
serial lines on these machines.
