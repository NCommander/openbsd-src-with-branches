OpenBSD/sun3 OSREV runs on most Sun3 machines, including:
		3/50, 3/60, 3/110
		3/75, 3/140, 3/150, 3/160, 3/180
		3/260, 3/280

OpenBSD/sun3 OSREV does not run on the Sun3/80  and Sun3/4x0 (sun3x
class) because the sun3x MMU and other devices are very different.

The minimal configuration requires 4M of RAM and ~80MB of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space (approx.
100MB additional space is necessary for full sources).  To run X
or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  Good performance
requires 8MB of RAM, or 16 MB when running the X Window System.

The following Sun3 hardware is supported:

	Serial ports (RS232):
		built-in ttya, ttyb

	Video adapters:
		bwtwo, cgtwo, cgfour

	Network interfaces:
		On-board Lance Ethernet (le)
		On-board or VME Intel Ethernet (ie)

	SCSI:  (Most SCSI disks, tapes, CD-ROMs, etc.)
		On-board "si" (SCSI-3)
		VME "si" (SCSI-3) board

	SMD Disks:  (the big, heavy ones)
		Xylogics 450/451
		Xylogics 753/7053

	Input devices:
		Sun keyboard and mouse

	Miscellaneous:
		Battery-backed real-time clock.

If it's not on this list, there is no support for it in this release.
