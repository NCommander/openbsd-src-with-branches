OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on most MACHINE machines, including:
		3/50
		3/60, 3/60LE
		3/75, 3/110, 3/1[4568]0
		3/2[68]0

OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV does not run on the Sun 3/80 and Sun 3/4x0 (sun3x
class) because the sun3x MMU and other devices are very different.

The minimal configuration requires 4M of RAM and ~80MB of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space (at least
200MB is recommended, without counting the additional space necessary
for sources or packages). To run X or compile the system, more memory
is recommended. Acceptable performance requires 8MB of RAM, or 16 MB
when running the X Window System.

	Serial ports (RS232):
		built-in ttya, ttyb

	Video adapters:
		bwtwo, cgtwo, cgfour
