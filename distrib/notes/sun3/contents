		install/	Boot programs, a GENERIC kernel,
				a stand-alone RAMDISK kernel,
				and a miniroot filesystem image.
				see below.

		binary/		sun3 binary distribution sets;
				see below.


The OpenBSD/sun3 "install" distribution contains files that can be
used to install OpenBSD onto a completely "bare" sun3.  The files
in the `.../install' directory are described below:

	miniroot.gz	A gzipped copy of the miniroot filesystem.
			This image is to be un-gzipped and copied
			into the swap area of a disk.

	bsd-rd.gz	A gzipped copy of the "RAMDISK kernel"
			for installing the miniroot filesystem.

	bsd-gen.gz	A gzipped GENERIC kernel (for upgrade)

	netboot		A copy of the network boot program.
			This is useful if you are installing
			a diskless OpenBSD/sun3 system.

	tapeboot	A copy of the tape boot program, used
			as the first segment of a boot tape.

These files can be used to make a boot tape suitable for installing
OpenBSD/sun3.  These files can also be used to configure an NFS server
to support installation "over the network".  See the section "Getting
the OpenBSD System onto Useful Media" for instructions on either method.
