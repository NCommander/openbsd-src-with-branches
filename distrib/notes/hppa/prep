The MACHINE computers do not generally need any specific preparation.

You might want to check that the console ``path'' in the PDC firmware
points to the device you plan to use, and change it if necessary. Most
models will allow to select console path from BOOT_ADMIN> prompt. To get
to the prompt -- terminate the autoboot process and if prompted so select
"Enter Boot Administration mode."

To select first serial port as console type:

	BOOT_ADMIN> path console rs232_a.9600.8.none

or to select graphics as console:

	BOOT_ADMIN> path console graphics
	BOOT_ADMIN> path keyboard hil
or
	BOOT_ADMIN> path console graphics
	BOOT_ADMIN> path keyboard ps2

On some models, such as 712, PDC firmware does not allow changing the
console path. In this case boot into the boot> prompt (assuming booting
from bootp/tftp or otherwise substitute your boot device for lan):

	BOOT_ADMIN> boot lan isl

and then at the boot> prompt:

	boot> machine console rs232.9600.8.none

WARNING!
Make sure you have typed the console path correctly or 712 can
go comatose and will require a special "dagger" board to be revived.

After changing the console path machine has to be power cycled
for changes to take effect.

In most case the primary boot device path is already set to the right
value. In those cases it has to be changed use:

	BOOT_ADMIN> search

to display the list of all bootable devices and then:

	BOOT_ADMIN> path primary SCSI.TARGET.LUN

Substitute FWSCSI or SESCSI for SCSI if it is displayed so in the path list
above and use TARGET and LUN of the device listed or just simply copy
over the string.

Also consult the boot(8) page for more information on boot commands.
