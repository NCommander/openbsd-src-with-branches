At the moment, the only way to install OpenBSD is to use a diskless setup.
No installation media is provided.


Diskless Setup Configuration:

In order to bootstrap via the network, you must provide a second system to
act as a boot server. It is convenient if this is a second OpenBSD machine
as the necessary services are already installed, although source code for
such programs as mopd can be found in OpenBSD's source tree, and should be
reasonably portable to other UN*X-like operating systems. More information
on diskless booting can be found in the OpenBSD diskless(8) manual page.

Your MACHINE expects to be able to download a so-called LIF (``Logical
Interchange Format'') image, containing both the boot code and the kernel,
via the HP rboot protocol, for older firmware, or via bootp or dhcp, for
more recent firmware.


Old firmware operation

PDC ROM v1.4 and below are easily recognizable, as they will start with a
text banner. There are two levels of interactive commands in this version.
The first level is a short menu:

	b)   Boot from specified device
	s)   Search for bootable device
	a)   Enter Boot Administration mode
	x)   Exit and continue boot sequence

	Select from menu:

In this case, you will need to setup rbootd on the server. Start by creating
an /etc/rbootd.conf file on the bootserver. The format of this file is the
ethernet address followed by the LIF filename. Here is an example:

	08:00:09:70:c4:11		boot.lif

Then start rbootd (or configure /etc/rc.conf to always start rbootd). Once
rbootd is running, the server name will then appear on the MACHINE as part of
the possible boot choices in a boot device search (``s'' command).


Modern firmware operation

PDC ROM 1.5 and above will start with a small graphics window at the screen
center (unless you are using a serial console). There is only one interactive
mode, with a BOOT_ADMIN> prompt, which provides both boot settings and
commands.

In this case, you will need to setup either bootpd or dhcpd on the server.
Assuming a bootp setup, start by editing the /etc/bootptab on the bootserver,
and declare an information block. Here is an example:

	boron:\
		ha=08000970c411:\
		bf=boot.lif:\
		hd=:\
		ht=ethernet:\
		ip=10.42.42.42:\
		rp=/export/MACHINE:\
		sm=255.0.0.0:\
		td=/tftpboot:

Do not forget to enable bootpd, either as a standalone process, or via inetd.

You will also need to enable tftpd, for the MACHINE to download its boot.lif
(bf entry) image from the server in the /tftpboot (td entry) directory.


Common operation

Next you need to export a directory for your new machine to mount over
NFS. This is accomplished by adding an entry to /etc/exports such as:

	/export/MACHINE -maproot=root snake

where ``snake'' is the hostname of your MACHINE.

Finally, you need to add an entry for your MACHINE in /etc/bootparams.
For example:

	snake		root=myserver:/export/MACHINE

Enable rpc.bootparamd either by turning it on in /etc/rc.conf and rebooting,
or by running it manually.

Unpack at least `base{:--:}OSrev.tgz' and `etc{:--:}OSrev.tgz' sets on the server in the
root directory for your target machine, `/export/MACHINE' in this example. If
you elect to use a separately NFS-mounted filesystem for `/usr' with your
diskless setup, make sure the "./usr" base files in base{:--:}OSrev.tgz end
up in the correct location. One way to do this is to temporarily use a
loopback mount on the server, re-routing <root>/usr to your server's exported
OpenBSD "/usr" directory.

A few configuration files in <root>/etc need to be edited:

	dhclient.conf
		DHCP client information, if necessary, check dhclient.conf(5)
		for the syntax.
	fstab
		Enter the entries for the remotely mounted filesystems.
		For example:
		  server:/export/root/client       /     nfs  rw 0 0
		  server:/export/exec/MACHINE.OpenBSD /usr  nfs  rw 0 0
		Be sure to add the server swap space, such as:
		  server:/export/swap/client none swap sw,nfsmntpt=/swap 0 0
		after creating the `<root>/swap' directory.
	hostname.if (likely, hostname.ie0)
		Configuration of the host adapter, check hostname.if(5)
		for the syntax.
	hosts
		Add the IP addresses of both server and client.
	mygate
		This file contains the IP address of the default gateway.
	myname
		This file contains the client's hostname, with a
		fully-qualified domain name.
	resolv.conf
		Name server configuration, check resolv.conf(5) for the
		syntax.

Now you must populate the `/dev' directory for your client. After
changing your working directory to `<root>/dev', run the MAKEDEV script.
Depending on your host operating system, you may get error messages about
unknown users and groups. These errors are inconsequential for the purpose
of installing OpenBSD.  However, you will want to correct them after
booting your machine. To do so, simply re-run MAKEDEV on your OpenBSD
machine once it has booted.

Once these files are configured, your system should be able to behave like
any other OpenBSD system once booted. On your MACHINE, escape to a prompt and
boot from the network by entering ``boot lan isl''. On old PDC firmware, you
will need to enter administration mode first.

dnl this is a bit hypocritical. Oh well.
