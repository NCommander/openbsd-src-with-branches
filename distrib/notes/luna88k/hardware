OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on the OMRON Luna-88K workstations family.

The minimal configuration requires 16MB of RAM and ~250MB of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to
compile the system, more RAM is recommended.

Supported devices:

	On-board console serial port (siotty)
	On-board LANCE Ethernet interface (le)
	On-board SCSI controllers (spc)
	LCD display on front panel (not user-controllable)
	Keyboard, mouse and frame buffer (suitable as a console too)

Devices not listed above are not supported by this release.
