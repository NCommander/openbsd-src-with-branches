OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on the OMRON LUNA-88K workstations family.

16MB of RAM should be sufficient to boot and a minimal system can probably
be squeezed onto a 250MB disk by installing only the `base' and `etc' sets.
However, a minimum of 32MB is recommended for serious usage of the system.

Supported devices:

	On-board console serial port (siotty)
	On-board LANCE Ethernet interface (le)
	On-board SCSI controllers (spc)
	LCD display on front panel (lcd)
	Keyboard, mouse and frame buffer (suitable as a console too)
