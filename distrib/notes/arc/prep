Before you start you should familiarize yourself with the BIOS setup
and how to run programs from the BIOS screen.

You should also examine the guide on the OpenBSD/arc web site, which
will hopefully soon have more complete and more up-to-date
instructions than are given in the install document.

If you're installing OpenBSD/arc for the first time it's a very good idea
to look at the partition sizes of disk you intend installing OpenBSD on.
Changing the size of partitions after you've installed is difficult.
If you do not have a spare bootable disk, it may be simpler to  re-install
OpenBSD again from scratch.

Asumming a classic partition scheme with root (`/') and /usr filesystems,
a comfortable size for the OpenBSD root filesystem partition is about 32M.
Hovever it has shown that 64M is not a bad choise when more packages are
to be installed. A good initial size for the swap partition is twice the
amount of physical memory in your machine or at least 64M. A minimum /usr
partition is ~150M but with that you will run into trouble later. A minimum
size of 350M is recommended. A full binary installation, without X11 or
other additional software, takes about 130MB in `/usr'.
