Installation is supported from several media types, including:

	CD-ROM
	FFS partitions
	DOS (FAT) partitions
	EXT2 partitions
	HTTP

Although you can access the distribution sets directly from one of the
OpenBSD mirrors over the internet, you may wish to transfer the sets to
a local HTTP server, or copy them to a partition on the target system's
disk (for upgrades only).
