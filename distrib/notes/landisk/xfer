Installation is supported from several media types, including:

	CD-ROM
	FFS partitions
	DOS (FAT) partitions
	EXT2 partitions
	HTTP

Although you can access the distribution sets directly from the CD-ROM or
from one of the OpenBSD mirrors over the internet, you may wish to transfer
the sets to a local HTTP server, or copy them to a partition on the target
system's disk (for upgrades only).
