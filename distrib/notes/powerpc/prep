OpenBSD/MACHINE is now capable of booting either from a dedicated
disk using a MBR partitioned disk or sharing a disk with MacOS.

If the disk is to be shared between MacOS and OpenBSD, it is necessary
to reformat and install the MacOS partitions first, using the MacOS tools,
leaving space on the disk as an "Unused" partition or as another partition
that is reused for OpenBSD.

For dedicated disks, MACHINE port boots off a boot program in
an MSDOS filesystem. This is now set up by the install program
and no special setup is required.
