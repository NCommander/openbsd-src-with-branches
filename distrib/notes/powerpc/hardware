OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on iMac and possibly some other G3 and
first generation G4 Macintosh systems. Older Adb based system are
unlikely to work. This is partially firmware issues and partially
driver issues.

Has been tested on iMac Rev A 233Mhz and Rev C 333Mhz machines, and on
450MHz mono-processor G4 machines.  Some success has been reported on
a PowerBook, however this is not well supported.

This version will likely not work on any of the B&W G3 or newer G4
machines (bi-processor and Cube).  Some code has been rewritten to
work better on the B&W G3, but never has been retested. Hardware
availability is currently limiting development on those systems.
