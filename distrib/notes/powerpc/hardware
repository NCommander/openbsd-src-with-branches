OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on ISA (AT-Bus), and PCI buses
with 603, 603e, 604, 604e processors.
Only systems with openfirmware are supported.
Has been tested on various Motorola (MCG) boards:
	VME16xx, Ultra, Pro2000,
	Pro3000, Series E and Series DT.
Also tested on a V-I Power-3 vme board.

The minimal configuration is said to require 8M of RAM and 150M of
disk space, though we do not know of anyone running with a system
quite this minimal today.  To install the entire system requires much
more disk space,
