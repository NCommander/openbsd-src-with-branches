OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on iMac and possibly some other G3 and G4 Power
Macintosh systems.  Older ADB-based systems are unlikely to work.  This is
partially due to firmware issues and partially drive issues.

Has been tested on iMac Rev A/233MHz and Rev C/333MHz machines as well as
several Power Macintosh G4 systems (single and dual processor).  Some
success has been reported on a PowerBook, however this is not well
supported.

Some code has been written to work better on the B&W G3, but has never
been retested.  Hardware availability is currently limiting development on
these systems.
