OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on iMac and possibly some other G3 Macintosh 
systems. Older Adb based system are unlikely to work. This is partially
firmware issues and partially driver issues.

Has been tested on iMac  Rev A 233Mhz and Rev C 333Mhz machines,
Some success has been reported on a PowerBook, however this is
not well supported.

This version will likely not work on any of the B&W G3 or any G4 machines.
Some code has been rewritten to work better on the B&W G3, but never
has been retested. Hardware availability is currently limiting development
on those systems.
