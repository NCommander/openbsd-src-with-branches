OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on ISA (AT-Bus), and PCI buses
with 603, 603e, 604, 604e processors.
Only systems with openfirmware are supported.
The V-I Power-4e vme board.
Has been tested on various Motorola (MCG) boards:
	Pro3000, Series E and Series DT.
	VME16xx, Ultra have not been tested, but should work.
	Pro4000 may not work due to irq problem with onboard ethernet.

MCG 603 machines will not work with later firmware. A firmware
incompatibility exists that has not yet been fixed. Some versions
of earlier openfirmware work fine with 603 family machines.

The minimal configuration is said to require 8M of RAM and 380M of
disk space, though we do not know of anyone running with a system
quite this minimal today.  To install the entire system requires much
more disk space,
