OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on iMac, G4 Power Macintosh, G4 Cube as well
as possibly some other G3 Macintosh systems.  Older ADB-based systems
will not work, only USB keyboard is supported.

Has been tested on iMac Rev A/233MHz and Rev C/333MHz machines, several
Power Macintosh G4 systems (single and dual processor), as well as the
G4 Cube.  Some success has been reported on a PowerBook, however this
is not well supported.

Some code has been written to work better on the B&W G3, but has never
been retested.  Hardware availability is currently limiting development on
these systems.
