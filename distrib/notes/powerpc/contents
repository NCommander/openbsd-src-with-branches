There are several ways to boot a supported PowerPC Macintosh system into
the OpenBSD installer.  Unfortunately they all currently require some
limited knowledge of Open Firmware commands.  Examples are provided below
for common configurations.

To access Open Firmware:
Upon booting, simultaneously hold down the Command, Option, O and F
keys until you are presented with a > prompt at which you can enter
commands, such as the "boot" command or others that allow you to view the
structure of the device tree. (cd /devalias, .properties)

Typical boot commands can be used by entering them at the Open Firmware
prompt and pressing enter/return.

To netboot from a pre-configured bootp/tftp/nfs server containing the
"ofwboot" and "bsd.rd" files at the root directory of the tftp server:

	boot enet:,ofwboot /bsd.rd

To boot from a HFS formatted CD containing the "ofwboot", "bsd.rd" and all
other installation files at the root directory of the CD:

	boot cd:,ofwboot /OSREV/powerpc/bsd.rd

Post-install, you will need to boot into OpenBSD from a hard drive, and
may need to reboot to Mac OS if you have it installed on another drive
connected to the system.  Typical commands for this are as follows:

To boot to an OpenBSD system installed on an ATA drive configured 
as a slave and connected to the same bus as the CD/DVD drive on a Power
Macintosh G4 (Tower):
	
	boot ide1:,ofwboot /bsd

To reboot to Mac OS:

	boot boot hd:,\\:tbxi

Typically, substituting the device alias (devalias) will allow for easy to
understand device selection.  Typical examples from a Power Macintosh G4
(Tower):

ultra0 = hd = master device, primary ATA bus (factory-installed drive)
ultra1 = slave device, primary ATA bus
ide0 = cd = master device, secondary ATA bus (CD/DVD drive)
ide1 = slave device, secondary ATA bus (Zip drive, if installed)
enet = motherboard ethernet device

NOTE:
The powerpc port does not currently support sharing the disk with MacOS
This is an important fact on the iMac which does not support more than
one disk.
