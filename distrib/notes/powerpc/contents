There are several ways to boot a supported PowerPC Macintosh system into
the OpenBSD installer.  Unfortunately they all currently require some
limited knowledge of Open Firmware, the low-level process that controls
the microprocessor after hardware initialization and diagnostics are
performed but before control is handed to the operating system.

To access Open Firmware you should simultaneously hold down the
Command, Option, O and F keys immediately upon booting.  You will
be presented with information and a ">" prompt that will look something
like this (example taken from a Power Macintosh G4):

To continue booting, type "mac-boot" and press return
To shut down, type "shut-down" and press return

Important Open Firmware command examples:
-----------------------------------------

boot cd:,ofwboot /OSREV/MACHINE/bsd.rd

		(boot from an appropriately prepared
		OpenBSD CD in the CD/DVD drive)

boot enet:,ofwboot /bsd.rd

		(netboot from a pre-configured bootp/tftp/nfs
		server containing the "ofwboot" and "bsd.rd"
		files at the root directory of the tftp server)

boot ide1:,ofwboot /bsd

		(After installation, boot /bsd from the slave
		 device on the second ATA bus)

mac-boot	(boot into MacOS)
reset-all	(reboot the machine)
shut-down	(halt the machine; shutdown)
printenv	(print current machine variables)
setenv		(set a machine variable)
devalias	(list device aliases; useful for locating other
		devices in the machine such as hard drives etc)

As seen above, device aliases typically take the form of "ide", "cd"
etc.  To boot to an alternative device you may substitute them
with entries from this list (example devices taken from a Power
Macintosh G4):

ultra0 = hd = master device, primary ATA bus (factory-installed drive)
ultra1 =      slave device, primary ATA bus
ide0   = cd = master device, secondary ATA bus (CD/DVD drive)
ide1   =      slave device, secondary ATA bus (Zip drive, if installed)
enet   =      motherboard ethernet device

Other Open Firmware command examples:
-------------------------------------

setenv auto-boot? false

		(force the machine to wait at Open Firmware
		for user input at next reboot; options are true/false)

setenv boot-device ide:,ofwboot /bsd

		(force the machine to boot into OpenBSD
		automatically at next reboot)

dev /		(change to root level of the device tree)
pwd		(show current location in the device tree)
ls		(show items at current location in the device tree)
words		(show methods of items at current location in the device tree)
.properties	(show properties of items at current location in the device tree)


NOTES:
	The powerpc port does not currently support sharing the disk with MacOS
	This is an important fact on the iMac which does not support more than
	one disk.

	The powerpc port does not currently support booting from the Zip drive,
	if installed.

	To reset a Power Macintosh to the factory-configure Open Firmware
	settings, simultaneously hold down the Command, Option, P, R keys
	immediately upon booting.  Typically the machine will then attempt to
	load Mac OS, if available.
