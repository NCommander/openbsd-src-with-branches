Instead of the single floppy, currently multiple floppies for different
systems exist. boot.fs is for VI vme board machines, and Motorola Powerstack
(and possibly other machines) and bootofw.fs is generic and should run on
any system with openfirmware because it only uses openfirmware for device
drivers (not recommended for general use).
This is a bootable install floppy which can be used both to install and to
upgrade OpenBSD to the current version.  It is also useful for maintenance
and disaster recovery.  In addition, the "tools/" directory contains some
utilities that might be useful for the installation.

Bootable installation/upgrade floppy:

	This disk contains a file system, is bootable, and has
	enough utilities on board to prepare your hard disk drive
	for OpenBSD and to install the OpenBSD distribution.

	It also holds the utilities needed in order to upgrade a
	system to the current version of OpenBSD.
