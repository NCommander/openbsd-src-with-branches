For the imac systems, no floppy image is available, for now it
is necessary to bootstrap the system from an existing BSD or unix system.

At this time the bootloader and kernel must initally be loaded from
the network.  To load the network bootloader and install kernel from
the openfirmware prompt type "boot enet:,ofwboot /bsd.rd".  This
assumes that that a machine is configured with bootp/tftp/nfs to make
the kernel and bootloader available.

To boot from CD, use "boot cd:,ofwboot /OSREV/powerpc/bsd.rd"

NOTE:
The powerpc port does not currently support sharing the disk with MacOS
This is an important fact on the imac which does not support more than
one disk.
