OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on iMac, G4 Power Macintosh, G4 Cube as well
as PowerBook and iBook machines.

Machines with older firmware: 6xxx, 7xxx 8xxx, and 9xxx machines are
not supported.  PowerMac G3 Beige status is unknown.

OpenBSD/MACHINE has been tested on iMac Revs A-C as well as on iMac DV(+)
machines, Power Macintosh G4 systems (single and dual processor), as well as
the G4 Cube. B&W G3 and LCD iMac support has been added in 3.1.

For portables, PowerBook G3, PowerBook G4, iBook and iBook2 have been
tested.  Note that power saving features on portables are very limited,
no power management features are available, suspend/sleep is not supported.
However battery level and status charging/AC connected/AC disconnected
is supported via an APM emulation layer.
