For MACHINE, OpenBSD OSREV adds support for more machines, PowerBook G3,
PowerBook G4, iBooks and newer iMac systems. System stability is greatly
improved. Sharing of disks between OpenBSD/MACHINE and MacOS is supported.
Booting OpenBSD from CD and automatically rebooting into OpenBSD is now
supported, with proper Open Firmware settings.
