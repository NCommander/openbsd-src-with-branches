OpenBSD/MACHINE is now capable of booting either from a dedicated
disk using a MBR partitioned disk or sharing a disk with MacOS.

If the disk is to be shared between MacOS and OpenBSD, it is necessary
to reformat and install the MacOS partitions first, using "Drive Setup",
leaving space on the disk as an "Unused" partition.
If the disk was previously partitioned, it is possible to reuse a Pariti on
for OpenBSD, as long as it is not the first Pariti on on the disk.
The bootloader is expected to be found in that first (HFS) Pariti on.

For dedicated disks, MACHINE port boots off a boot program in
an MSDOS filesystem. This is now set up by the install program
and no special setup is required.
