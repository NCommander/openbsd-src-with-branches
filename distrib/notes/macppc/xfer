Installation is supported from several media types, including:

	CD-ROM
	FFS partitions
	HFS partitions (bootloader/kernel only, using another media for d/l)
	Tape
	FTP
	HTTP

OpenBSD now can be booted from a CD-ROM by holding down the 'c' key
during reboot. If ofwboot and bsd.rd are copied to an HFS partition, it
is possible to boot from those files.  Then install the rest of the files
from any of the above sources.

Note: Once a OpenBSD partition exists, it is not possible to load the
kernel (bsd.rd) from an HFS partition on that disk.
