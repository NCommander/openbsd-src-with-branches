OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV is a port to the UltraSPARC processor-based machines,
such as the workstations manufactured by Sun Microsystems.

Since the previous release, device support still has improved a lot (new
models and on-board devices support), and stability has improved.
More applications from the ports collection have been compiled and tested on
this platform as well.
