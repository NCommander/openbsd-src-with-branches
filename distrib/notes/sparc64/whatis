OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV is a port to the UltraSPARC processor-based machines,
such as the workstations manufactured by Sun Microsystems.

Since the previous release, device support has improved a lot (new models
supported, X Window support), and stability has improved.
More applications from the ports collection have been compiled and tested on
this platform as well.
