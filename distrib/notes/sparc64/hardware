OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on the following classes of machines:
	- SBUS based workstations:
		Ultra 1
		Ultra 1E (Creator)
		Ultra 2
	- PCI based workstations:
		Blade 100 (onboard ethernet has issues)
		Enterprise 250
		Netra X1
		Ultra 5
		Ultra 10
		Ultra 30
dnl XXX uncomment machine entries as they become supported
dnl		Ultra 60 / Enterprise 220R
dnl		Ultra 80 / Enterprise 420R
dnl		Ultra 450 / Enterprise 450
		SPARCengineUltra AX
		SPARCengineUltra AXi
	- faithful clones of the above Sun systems.

If your machine is not listed above, it is very likely that OpenBSD/MACHINE
does not work on it (yet).

The minimal configuration requires 32M of RAM and ~160M of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.

At the moment, the X window system is not available.

Hardware the we do NOT currently support, but get many questions about:

	Framebuffers (these will work as PROM console output and raster
	  console, but X Window support yet).
	Keyboards (these will work as PROM console input, but no X Window
	  support yet).
	Mice (no X Window support yet).
	Multiprocessor machines.
	Floppy driver (except for booting).
	SBUS and PCI cards other than those listed above.
