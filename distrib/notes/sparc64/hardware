OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on the following classes of machines:
	- SBUS based workstations:
		Ultra 1
		Ultra 1/Creator (should work, but has not been tested)
		Ultra 2 (should work, but could not be tested)
	- PCI based workstations:
		Blade 100 (onboard ethernet has issues)
		Enterprise 250
		Ultra 5
		Ultra 10
		Ultra 30
		SPARCengineUltra AX
		SPARCengineUltra AXi
	- faithful clones of the above Sun systems.

If your machine is not listed above, it is very likely that OpenBSD/MACHINE
does not work on it (yet).

The minimal configuration requires 32M of RAM and ~160M of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.

At the moment, the X window system is not available.

Supported devices {:-include-:}:
	serial ports: 
		Zilog ttya and ttyb (can be used as console if needed),

	ethernet: 
		on-board AMD Lance ethernet ("le0")
		SBus AMD Lance ethernet cards
		PCI/SBus SunSwift and Quad FastEthernet cards (hme, qfe)
		SBus FastEthernet cards (qec+be)
		SBus QuadEthernet cards (qec+qe)

	SCSI: 
		on-board "esp" SCSI controller
		SBus "esp" SCSI controller (including 3rd party compatibles)

	framebuffers:
		on-board framebuffers,
		(but the kernel will use the OpenPROM console still).


Hardware the we do NOT currently support, but get many questions about:
	Multiprocessor machines
	Audio drivers
	Floppy driver (except for booting)
	FFB (Creator), PGX and AFB (Elite 3D) framebuffers
        SBus ZX framebuffer (aka Leo)
	other PCI and SBus cards have not been tested yet.
