OpenBSD/sparc64 OSREV runs on the following classes of machines:
	- SBUS based workstations:
		Ultra 1
	- PCI based workstations:
		Ultra 5
	- faithful clones of the above Sun systems.

OpenBSD/sparc64 OSREV does NOT run on these machines (yet):
	- Sun Blade 100

The minimal configuration requires 32M of RAM and ~120M of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.

Supported devices {:-include-:}:
	serial ports: 
		Zilog ttya and ttyb (can be used as console if needed),

	ethernet: 
		on-board AMD Lance ethernet ("le0"), 
		SBus AMD Lance ethernet cards, 
		PCI/SBus SunSwift and Quad FastEthernet cards (hme, qfe)
		SBus FastEthernet cards (qec+be)
		SBus QuadEthernet cards (qec+qe)

	SCSI: 
		on-board "esp" SCSI controller
		SBus "esp" SCSI controller (including 3rd party compatibles), 

Hardware the we do NOT currently support, but get many questions about:
	Multiprocessor machines
	Audio drivers
	Floppy driver
        SBus cgeight framebuffers
        SBus GS framebuffer (aka cgtwelve)
        SBus GT framebuffer ("Graphics Tower")
        SBus ZX framebuffer (aka Leo)
