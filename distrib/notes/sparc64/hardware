OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on the following classes of machines:
	- SBUS based workstations:
		Ultra 1
		Ultra 2 (should work, but could not be tested)
	- PCI based workstations:
		Ultra 5
		Ultra 10
	- faithful clones of the above Sun systems.

OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV does NOT run on these machines (yet):
	- Sun Blade 100 (onboard ethernet has issues)
	- Ultra 30 (onboard scsi has issues)
	- other, unlisted, UltraSPARC machines.

The minimal configuration requires 32M of RAM and ~160M of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.

At the moment, the X window system is not available.

Supported devices {:-include-:}:
	serial ports: 
		Zilog ttya and ttyb (can be used as console if needed),

	ethernet: 
		on-board AMD Lance ethernet ("le0"), 
		SBus AMD Lance ethernet cards, 
		PCI/SBus SunSwift and Quad FastEthernet cards (hme, qfe)
		SBus FastEthernet cards (qec+be)
		SBus QuadEthernet cards (qec+qe)

	SCSI: 
		on-board "esp" SCSI controller
		SBus "esp" SCSI controller (including 3rd party compatibles), 

	framebuffers:
		on-board framebuffer, as text console only

Hardware the we do NOT currently support, but get many questions about:
	Multiprocessor machines
	Audio drivers
	Floppy driver
        SBus cgeight framebuffers
        SBus GS framebuffer (aka cgtwelve)
        SBus GT framebuffer ("Graphics Tower")
        SBus ZX framebuffer (aka Leo)
	other PCI and SBus cards have not been tested yet.
