				program
		bootblk		The OpenBSD/MACHINE boot block
		ofwboot		The OpenBSD/MACHINE secondary boot loader
		ofwboot.net	The OpenBSD/MACHINE network boot loader


Please note that there are multiple bootable images and kernels, intended
to allow installing OpenBSD/MACHINE in a variety of situations without
requiring a pre-existing working operating system.

dnl The "miniroot{:--:}OSrev.fs" is a small bootable root filesystem that can be used
dnl for installation or upgrade where there is some means to copy the miniroot
dnl image into a swap or unused partition on the system, and also for diskless
dnl or net booting.  This can be convenient if you have a existing installation
dnl of OpenBSD, NetBSD, or Solaris and wish to test or upgrade the existing
dnl system to OpenBSD.

These bootable images are also useful as "failsafe" boots for system
maintenance and disaster recovery.

The kernel and boot images are provided for net booting installations.
