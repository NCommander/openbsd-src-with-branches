		installboot	The OpenBSD/sparc64 boot loader installation

		bootblk		The OpenBSD/sparc64 boot block
		ofwboot		The OpenBSD/sparc64 secondary boot loader
		ofwboot.net	The OpenBSD/sparc64 network boot loader


Please note that there are multiple bootable images and kernels, intended
to allow installing OpenBSD/sparc64 in a variety of situations without
requiring a pre-existing working operating system.

The "miniroot{:--:}OSrev.fs" is a small bootable root filesystem that can be used
for installation or upgrade where there is some means to copy the miniroot
image into a swap or unused partition on the system, and also for diskless
or net booting.  This can be convenient if you have a existing installation
of OpenBSD, NetBSD, or Solaris and wish to test or upgrade the existing
system to OpenBSD.

These bootable images are also useful as "failsafe" boots for system
maintenance and disaster recovery.

The kernel and boot images are provided for net booting installations.
While the OpenBSD bootblocks will work with the provided miniroot images,
Sun bootblocks require a separate kernel image and root filesystem.
