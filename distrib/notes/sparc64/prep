Your OpenBOOT ROM may need some setup.  You cannot use the security modes
of the OpenBOOT ROM.  Make sure that the ROM security modes are disabled:

    ok setenv security-mode none


Please note that while OpenBSD and Solaris have a reasonable degree of
compatibility between disk labels and filesystems there are some problems
to watch out for during initial installation or when trying to maintain
both OpenBSD and Solaris environments on the same system.

    If the OpenBSD fsck(8) utility is used on a Solaris filesystem, it will
    set OpenBSD "clean flags" and BSD4.4 summary fields in the superblock.
    Solaris does *not* like this and you will have to do a "fsck -b 32" under
    Solaris to access an alternate superblock to repair the filesystem.  You
    should always specify Solaris filesystem with a "pass number" of 0 in
    their /etc/fstab entry to prevent this, and preferably mount them "RO".

    If Solaris fsck is used on an OpenBSD filesystem in the default OpenBSD
    (4.4BSD) format, it will first complain about the superblock and then
    about missing . and .. entries.  Do *not* try to "correct" these
    problems, as attempting to do so will completely trash the filesystem.

    You should avoid using soft updates (option softdep in /etc/fstab)
    on your shared filesystems.  Although untested, it is likely that
    Solaris would be confused by a filesystem with soft update flags
    enabled.

The OpenBSD "Sun Compatible" disklabel have been extended to support 16
partitions, which may be compatible with Solaris, but the Solaris
format(1M) utility only sees the first 8 partitions and may "lose"
information about the extended partitions.

Use Solaris format(1M) only with *extreme* caution on drives that contain
OpenBSD partitions.


OpenBSD and Sun bootblocks are similar in concept, though implemented
differently.  The OpenBSD bootblocks are architecture independent and also
understand the extended disklabels with 16 partitions.  You can use Solaris
bootblocks, but remember that OpenBSD bootblocks must be installed with
OpenBSD installboot and Solaris bootblocks with Solaris installboot.

Most of new Ultras shipped by Sun with a preinstalled Solaris have an
initial specific factory setup of the boot ROM, in order to start up
Solaris WebStart at the first boot; the boot-device variable is set to
disk:f.  Make sure you reset the boot device to its default value:

    ok set-default boot-device

will work for most systems. This can be adapted if you've multiple
systems installed and know what you're doing.
