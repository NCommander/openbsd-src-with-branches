OpenBSD/mvme88k 2.3 was written because the MVME187 existed in a computer 
company basement.  Nivas Madhur started the port.  Steve Murphree, Jr. 
finished the port in December 1998.  Code by Dale Rahn, Theo de Raadt, 
and Chuck Cranor was used as a starting point. Currently this port runs 
on MVME187 and perhaps other models also.
