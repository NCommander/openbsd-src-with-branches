OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on the following MVME boards:

	- MVME187 (Single board computer with 88100 processor)
	- MVME188 (HYPERmodule-based systems with up to 4 88100 processors)

OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV also runs on the Motorola M8120 system, which is a
non-expandable MVME187.

The minimal configuration requires 16MB of RAM and ~250M of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to
compile the system, more RAM is recommended.

Supported HYPERmodules: (for MVME188 systems)
	2P64 (2 88100 processors, 4 88200 CMMUs)
	2P256 (2 88100 processors, 4 88204 CMMUs)
	4P128 (4 88100 processors, 8 88200 CMMUs)
	4P512 (4 88100 processors, 8 88204 CMMUs)

The 1P64, 1P128, 2P128 and 2P512 HYPERmodules are not currently supported.
