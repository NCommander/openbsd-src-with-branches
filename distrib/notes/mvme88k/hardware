OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on the systems built around the following
MVME boards:

	- MVME187 (Single board computer with 88100 processor)
	- MVME188 (HYPERmodule-based systems with up to 4 88100 processors)

Besides various Motorola complete systems (M8120, MVME187-based series
900, etc), OpenBSD/MACHINE also runs on the MVME187-based Triton Dolphin
System 100.

The minimal configuration requires 16MB of RAM and ~250MB of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to
compile the system, more RAM is recommended.

Supported HYPERmodules: (for MVME188 systems)

	2P64 (2 88100 processors, 4 88200 CMMUs)
	2P256 (2 88100 processors, 4 88204 CMMUs)
	4P128 (4 88100 processors, 8 88200 CMMUs)
	4P512 (4 88100 processors, 8 88204 CMMUs)

	The 1P64, 1P128, 2P128 and 2P512 HYPERmodules are not
	currently supported.

Supported devices:

	Cirrus Logic CD2401 serial ports, tty00-tty03/tty07(M8120) (cl)
	Intel 82596CA Ethernet (ie)
	NCR53c710 SCSI Controller (ssh)
	128KB SRAM (/dev/sram0)
	8KB NVRAM (/dev/nvram0)

MVME188 on-board devices:
