Before installing OpenBSD on your machine, you will want to check your
machine's NVRAM settings.

The defaults settings are usually suitable for OpenBSD; make sure the
environment is configured in BUG mode. You can check and change this with
the ENV command.

Be sure to use the SET command to set the date before trying to use the
ethernet support in the 187-Bug.

If you plan to boot from the network, make sure your ENV settings match
the following setup:

Network Auto Boot Enable [Y/N]   = N? y
Network Auto Boot at power-up only [Y/N] = Y? n
Network Auto Boot Abort Delay    = 5? 2
Network Auto Boot Configuration Parameters Pointer (NVRAM) = 00000000? fffc0080
