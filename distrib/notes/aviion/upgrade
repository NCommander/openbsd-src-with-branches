To upgrade your OpenBSD installation, simply extract the new sets on
the diskless server.

It is strongly advised that you unpack the etc{:--:}OSrev.tgz set in
a temporary directory and merge changes by hand, since some components of
your system may not function correctly until your files in `/etc' are
updated.
