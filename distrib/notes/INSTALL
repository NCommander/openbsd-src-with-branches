INSTALLATION NOTES for OpenBSD/MACHINE 2.1


What is OpenBSD?
----------------

OpenBSD is a Berkeley Networking Release 2 (Net/2) and 4.4BSD-Lite
-derived Operating System.  It is a fully functional UN*X-like system
which runs on many architectures and is being ported to more.

Continuing the multi-platform tradition, OpenBSD has added ports to
mvme68k, powerpc and arc machines.  Kernel interfaces have continued to
be refined, and now several subsystems and device drivers are shared
among the different ports.  You can look for this trend to continue.

Security of the system as a whole has been significantly
improved. Source code for all critical system components has been
checked for remote-access, local-access, denial-of-service, data
destruction, or information-gathering problems.

OpenBSD 2.1 has significantly enhanced the binary emulation subsystem 
(which includes iBCS2, Linux, OSF/1, SunOS, SVR4, Solaris and Ultrix
compatibility) and several kernel subsystems have been generalized
to support this more readily.  The binary emulation strategy is 
aimed at making the emulation as accurate as possible.

Cryptography components are part of OpenBSD. OpenBSD is from Canada,
and export of these pieces (such as kerberosIV) to the world is not
restricted. Note that it can not be re-exported from the US once it
has entered US.

Many new user programs have been added in OpenBSD 2.1, as well,
bringing it closer to our goal of supplying a complete UN*X-like
environment. Tools like perl and ksh are standard, as are numerous
other useful tools.

OpenBSD 2.1 Release Contents:
-----------------------------

The OpenBSD 2.1 release is organized in the following way:

.../2.1/
		src/			Source distribution sets; see
					below.

In addition to the files and directories listed above, there is one
directory per architecture, for each of the architectures that OpenBSD
2.1 has a binary distribution for.  (That is described further along in
this document).

The source distribution sets can be found in subdirectories of the
"source" subdirectory of the distribution tree.  They contain the 
complete sources to the system.  The source distribution sets 
are as follows:

	gsrc21	This set contains the "gnu" sources, including
		the source for the compiler, assembler, groff,
		and the other GNU utilities in the binary distribution
		sets.
		[ 7.1M gzipped, 30.4M uncompressed ]

	ksrc21	This set contains the sources to the OpenBSD 2.1
		kernel, config(8), config.old(8) and dbsym(8).
		[ 6.0M gzipped, 27.0M uncompressed ]

	ssrc21	This set contains the "share" sources, which include
		the sources for the man pages not associated with
		any particular program, the sources for the
		typesettable document set, the dictionaries, and more.
		[ 2.4M gzipped, 8.9M uncompressed ]

	src21	This set contains all of the OpenBSD 2.1 sources which
		are not mentioned above.
		[ 9.3M gzipped, 41.6M uncompressed ]

It is worth noting that unless all of the source distribution sets
are installed (except the domestic set), you can't rebuild and install
the system from scratch, straight out of the box.  However, all that is
required to rebuild the system in that case is a trivial modification 
to one Makefile.

The source distribution sets are distributed as groups of files named
"set_name.xx" where "set_name" is the distribution set name, and "xx"
is the sequence number of the file, starting with "aa" for the first
file in the distribution set, then "ab" for the next, and so on.  All
of these files except the last one of each set should be exactly
240,640 bytes long.  (The last file is just long enough to contain the
remainder of the data for that distribution set.)

Catted together, the files belonging to a source distribution set 
comprise a gzipped tar file.  If you want to look at list of the files
contained in the set, you could use the command:

	cd /usr/src; cat set_name.?? | tar tvfz -

or to actually extract the files contained in the set:

	cd /usr/src; cat set_name.?? | tar xfpz -

In each of the source distribution set directories, there are two
files named "CKSUMS" and "MD5" which contain the checksums of the
files in that directory, as generated by the cksum(1) and md5(1)
utilities respectively.  If you suspect that one of the files is
corrupt and have access to a cksum or md5 binary, you can compare
their output to the "CKSUMS" or "MD5" file.

OpenBSD System Requirements and Supported Devices:
--------------------------------------------------

#include "hardware"

Getting the OpenBSD System on to Useful Media:
----------------------------------------------

#include "xfer"

Preparing your System for OpenBSD Installation:

#include "prep"

Installing the OpenBSD System:
------------------------------

#include "install"

Upgrading a previously-installed OpenBSD System:
------------------------------------------------

#include "upgrade"

Using online OpenBSD documentation:
-----------------------------------

Documentation is available if you first install the manual
distribution set.  Traditionally, the UN*X "man pages" (documentation)
are denoted by 'name(section)'.  Some examples of this are

	intro(1),
	man(1),
	apropros(1),
	passwd(1), and
	passwd(5).

The section numbers group the topics into several categories, but three
are of primary interest:  user commands are in section 1, file formats
are in section 5, and administrative information is in section 8.

The 'man' command is used to view the documentation on a topic, and is
started by entering 'man [section] topic'.  The brackets [] around the
section should not be entered, but rather indicate that the section is
optional.  If you don't ask for a particular section, the topic with the
least-numbered section name will be displayed.  For instance, after
logging in, enter 

	man passwd

to read the documentation for passwd(1).  To view the documentation for
passwd(5), enter

	man 5 passwd

instead.

If you are unsure of what man page you are looking for, enter

	apropos subject-word

where "subject-word" is your topic of interest; a list of possibly 
related man pages will be displayed.


Administrivia:
--------------

There are various mailing lists available via the mailing list
server at <majordomo@OpenBSD.ORG>.  To get help on using the mailing
list server, send mail to that address with an empty body, and it will
reply with instructions.

To report bugs, use the 'sendbug' command shipped with OpenBSD,
and fill in as much information about the problem as you can.  Good
bug reports include lots of details.  Additionally, bug reports can
be sent by mail to:

	bugs@OpenBSD.ORG

Use of 'sendbug' is encouraged, however, because bugs reported with it
are entered into the OpenBSD bugs database, and thus can't slip through
the cracks.

As a favor, please avoid mailing huge documents or files to the
mailing lists.  Instead, put the material you would have sent up
for FTP somewhere, then mail the appropriate list about it, or, if
you'd rather not do that, mail the list saying you'll send the data
to those who want it.
