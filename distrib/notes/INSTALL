INSTALLATION NOTES for OpenBSD/MACHINE 2.1


What is OpenBSD?
----------------

OpenBSD is a Berkeley Networking Release 2 (Net/2) and 4.4BSD-Lite
-derived Operating System.  It is a fully functional UN*X-like system
which runs on many architectures and is being ported to more.

Continuing the multi-platform tradition, OpenBSD has added ports to
mvme68k, powerpc and arc machines.  Kernel interfaces have continued
to be refined, and now several subsystems and device drivers are
shared among the different ports.  You can look for this trend to
continue.

Security of the system as a whole has been significantly improved.
Source code for all critical system components has been checked for
remote-access, local-access, denial-of-service, data destruction, or
information-gathering problems.  Tools like ipf, ipnat, and nc have
been added to the tree because security conscious people often need
them.

OpenBSD 2.1 has significantly enhanced the binary emulation subsystem
(which includes iBCS2, Linux, OSF/1, SunOS, SVR4, Solaris and Ultrix
compatibility) and several kernel subsystems have been generalized to
support this more readily.  The binary emulation strategy is aimed at
making the emulation as accurate as possible.

Cryptography components are part of OpenBSD.  OpenBSD is from Canada,
and export of these pieces (such as kerberosIV) to the world is not
restricted.  Note that it can not be re-exported from the US once it
has entered US.  Because of this, take care NOT to get the distrib-
ution from an FTP server in the US if you are outside of Canada and
the US.

Many new user programs have been added in OpenBSD 2.1, as well,
bringing it closer to our goal of supplying a complete and modern
UN*X-like environment.  Tools like perl and ksh are standard, as are
numerous other useful tools.

OpenBSD 2.1 Release Contents:
-----------------------------

The OpenBSD 2.1 release is organized in the following way.  In the
.../2.1 directory, there is one sub-directory per architecture, for
each of the architectures that OpenBSD 2.1 has a binary distribution
for.  That is described further along in this document).

#include "contents"

OpenBSD System Requirements and Supported Devices:
--------------------------------------------------

#include "hardware"

Getting the OpenBSD System onto Useful Media:
---------------------------------------------

#include "xfer"

Preparing your System for OpenBSD Installation:
-----------------------------------------------

#include "prep"

Installing the OpenBSD System:
------------------------------

#include "install"

Upgrading a previously-installed OpenBSD System:
------------------------------------------------

#include "upgrade"

Getting source code for your OpenBSD System:
--------------------------------------------

Now that your OpenBSD system is up and running, you probably want to get
access to source code so that you can recompile pieces of the system.

A few methods are provided.  If you have an OpenBSD CD, the source code
is provided.  Otherwise, you can get the pieces over the Internet using
ANONCVS, CTM or FTP.  For more information, see

	http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html
	http://www.openbsd.org/ctm.html
	http://www.openbsd.org/ftp.html

Using online OpenBSD documentation:
-----------------------------------

Documentation is available if you first install the manual
distribution set.  Traditionally, the UN*X "man pages" (documentation)
are denoted by 'name(section)'.  Some examples of this are

	intro(1),
	man(1),
	apropos(1),
	passwd(1), and
	passwd(5).

The section numbers group the topics into several categories, but three
are of primary interest:  user commands are in section 1, file formats
are in section 5, and administrative information is in section 8.

The 'man' command is used to view the documentation on a topic, and is
started by entering 'man [section] topic'.  The brackets [] around the
section should not be entered, but rather indicate that the section is
optional.  If you don't ask for a particular section, the topic with the
least-numbered section name will be displayed.  For instance, after
logging in, enter 

	man passwd

to read the documentation for passwd(1).  To view the documentation for
passwd(5), enter

	man 5 passwd

instead.

If you are unsure of what man page you are looking for, enter

	apropos subject-word

where "subject-word" is your topic of interest; a list of possibly 
related man pages will be displayed.


Administrivia:
--------------

There are various mailing lists available via the mailing list
server at <majordomo@OpenBSD.ORG>.  To get help on using the mailing
list server, send mail to that address with an empty body, and it will
reply with instructions.  There are also two OpenBSD Usenet newsgroups,
comp.unix.bsd.openbsd.announce for important announcements and
comp.unix.bsd.openbsd.misc for general OpenBSD discussion.

To report bugs, use the 'sendbug' command shipped with OpenBSD,
and fill in as much information about the problem as you can.  Good
bug reports include lots of details.  Additionally, bug reports can
be sent by mail to:

	bugs@OpenBSD.ORG

Use of 'sendbug' is encouraged, however, because bugs reported with it
are entered into the OpenBSD bugs database, and thus can't slip through
the cracks.

As a favor, please avoid mailing huge documents or files to the
mailing lists.  Instead, put the material you would have sent up
for FTP somewhere, then mail the appropriate list about it, or, if
you'd rather not do that, mail the list saying you'll send the data
to those who want it.
