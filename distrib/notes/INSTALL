INSTALLATION NOTES for OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV


What is OpenBSD?
----------------

OpenBSD is a fully functional, multi-platform UN*X-like Operating
System based on Berkeley Networking Release 2 (Net/2) and 4.4BSD-Lite.
There are several operating systems in this family, but OpenBSD
differentiates itself by putting security and correctness first. The
OpenBSD team strives to achieve what is called 'a secure by default'
status.  This means that an OpenBSD user should feel safe that their
newly installed machine will not be compromised.  This 'secure by
default' goal is achieved by taking a proactive stance on security.

Since security flaws are esentially mistakes in design or implement-
ation, the OpenBSD team puts as much importance on finding and fixing
existing design flaws and implementation bugs as it does writing new
code.  This means that an OpenBSD system will not only be more secure,
but it will be more stable.  The source code for all critical system
components has been checked for remote-access, local-access, denial-
of-service, data destruction, and information-gathering problems.

In addition to bug fixing, OpenBSD has integrated strong cryptography
into the base system.  A fully functional IPSEC implementation is
provided as well as support for common protocols such as SSL and SSH.
Network filtering and monitoring tools such as ipf, ipnat, and
bridging are also standard.  For high performance demands, support for
hardware cryptography has also been added to the base system.  Because
security is often seen as a tradeoff with useability, OpenBSD provides
as many security options as possible to allow the user to enjoy secure
computing without feeling burdened by it.

Though security is the primary goal, OpenBSD continues the multi-
platform tradition.  Ports to mvme68k, powerpc and arc machines have
been added to the system.  To further this work, kernel interfaces
have continued to be refined and several subsystems and device drivers
are shared in a machine independent fashion among the different ports.
You can look for this trend to continue as newer architectures become
available.

To integrate more smoothly in other environments, OpenBSD OSREV has
significantly enhanced the binary emulation subsystem (which includes
iBCS2, Linux, OSF/1, SunOS, SVR4, Solaris and Ultrix compatibility)
and several kernel subsystems have been generalized to support this
more readily.  The binary emulation strategy is aimed at making the
emulation as accurate as possible so that it is transparent to the
user.

Many new user programs have been added in OpenBSD OSREV, as well,
bringing it closer to our goal of supplying a complete and modern
UN*X-like environment.  Tools like perl and ksh are standard, as are
numerous other useful tools.

Because OpenBSD is from Canada, the export of Cryptography pieces
(such as SSH, IPSEC, and kerberosIV) to the world is not restricted.

(NOTE: OpenBSD can not be re-exported from the US once it has entered
the US.  Because of this, take care NOT to get the distribution from
an FTP server in the US if you are outside of Canada and the US.)

OpenBSD OSREV Release Contents:
-----------------------------

The OpenBSD OSREV release is organized in the following way.  In the
.../OSREV directory, for each of the architectures having an OpenBSD OSREV
binary distribution, there is a sub-directory.

Getting source code for your OpenBSD System:
--------------------------------------------

Now that your OpenBSD system is up and running, you probably want to get
access to source code so that you can recompile pieces of the system.

A few methods are provided.  If you have an OpenBSD CD, the source code
is provided.  Otherwise, you can get the pieces over the Internet using
ANONCVS, CTM or FTP.  For more information, see

	http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html
	http://www.openbsd.org/ctm.html
	http://www.openbsd.org/ftp.html

Using online OpenBSD documentation:
-----------------------------------

Documentation is available if you first install the manual
distribution set.  Traditionally, the UN*X "man pages" (documentation)
are denoted by 'name(section)'.  Some examples of this are

	intro(1),
	man(1),
	apropos(1),
	passwd(1), and
	passwd(5).

The section numbers group the topics into several categories, but three
are of primary interest:  user commands are in section 1, file formats
are in section 5, and administrative information is in section 8.

The 'man' command is used to view the documentation on a topic, and is
started by entering 'man [section] topic'.  The brackets [] around the
section should not be entered, but rather indicate that the section is
optional.  If you don't ask for a particular section, the topic with the
least-numbered section name will be displayed.  For instance, after
logging in, enter 

	man passwd

to read the documentation for passwd(1).  To view the documentation for
passwd(5), enter

	man 5 passwd

instead.

If you are unsure of what man page you are looking for, enter

	apropos subject-word

where "subject-word" is your topic of interest; a list of possibly 
related man pages will be displayed.

Adding third party software; ``packages'' and ``ports'':

Administrivia:
--------------

There are various mailing lists available via the mailing list
server at <majordomo@OpenBSD.ORG>.  To get help on using the mailing
list server, send mail to that address with an empty body, and it will
reply with instructions.  There are also two OpenBSD Usenet newsgroups,
comp.unix.bsd.openbsd.announce for important announcements and
comp.unix.bsd.openbsd.misc for general OpenBSD discussion.

To report bugs, use the 'sendbug' command shipped with OpenBSD,
and fill in as much information about the problem as you can.  Good
bug reports {:-include-:} lots of details.  Additionally, bug reports can
be sent by mail to:

	bugs@OpenBSD.ORG

Use of 'sendbug' is encouraged, however, because bugs reported with it
are entered into the OpenBSD bugs database, and thus can't slip through
the cracks.

As a favor, please avoid mailing huge documents or files to the
mailing lists.  Instead, put the material you would have sent up
for FTP somewhere, then mail the appropriate list about it, or, if
you'd rather not do that, mail the list saying you'll send the data
to those who want it.
