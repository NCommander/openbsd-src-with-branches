	The fdisk(8) utility will be invoked to let you edit your MBR
	partitioning.  The current MBR partitions defined will be
	displayed and you will be allowed to modify them, and add new
	partitions.

	The setup will need two partitions, one 'OpenBSD' for the
	OpenBSD/MACHINE installation, and one 'MSDOS' for the
	U-Boot scripts/bootloader.

	If you use the whole disk option, the install script
	will create a small 'MSDOS' partition and use the rest of
	the disk for the OpenBSD installation.

	After your OpenBSD MBR partition has been setup, the real
	partition setup can follow.

	Installation set selection:
		A list of available distribution sets found on the
		given location will be listed.

		You may individually select distribution sets to install,
		by entering their name, or wildcards (e.g. `*.tgz' or
		`base*|comp*', or `all' to select all the sets (which
		is what most users will want to do).
		You may also enter `abort' to deselect everything and
		restart the selection from scratch, or unselect sets
		by entering their name prefixed with `-' (e.g. `-x*').

		It is also possible to enter an arbitrary filename and
		have it treated as a file set.

		Currently the comp set must be installed for the installer to
		work correctly.

		When you are done selecting distribution sets, enter
		`done'.  The files will begin to extract.
