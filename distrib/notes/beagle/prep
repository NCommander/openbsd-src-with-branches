Please be aware that OpenBSD support for this platform is far from
complete and that these instructions may still be rough.

If you are using a BeagleBoard xM you can use the following script to
create a bootable SD card:

#!/bin/sh
#
# Written by Dale Rahn <drahn@openbsd.org>, 2011.
#
# Create a bootable partition on ${DRIVE} for use with BeagleBoard xM.

echo $#
if (( $# < 3 ))
then
	echo fail
	exit 4
fi

DRIVE=$1
MLO=$2
UBOOT=$3

echo DRIVE ${DRIVE}
echo MLO ${MLO}
echo UBOOT ${UBOOT}

SIZE=$(fdisk ${DRIVE} | grep Disk | awk '{ print $5 }' | sed -e 's/\[//')

echo size ${SIZE}

CYL=$(echo ${SIZE}/255/63|bc)
echo cyl ${CYL}

MAXCYL=$(echo  ${CYL} - 1 | bc)

echo MAXCYL ${MAXCYL}

CHS="-c ${CYL} -h 255 -s 63"

echo CHS ${CHS}

dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/r${DRIVE}c bs=1m count=1 2>/dev/null

fdisk ${CHS} -yi ${DRIVE} >/dev/null

fdisk ${CHS} -e ${DRIVE} >/dev/null << DONE

# if msdos partition is > 32MB make this FAT32, not FAT16
newfs_msdos -F 16 -L boot /dev/r${DRIVE}i >/dev/null

You can download the signed U-Boot image here: http://humppa.nl/xM/MLO .
The U-boot binary can be downloaded here: http://humppa.nl/xM/u-boot.bin .

Insert the card into your computer and call the script like:

	# sh beagle_fmt_sd sd1 ./MLO ./u-boot.bin

When you have connected the BeagleBoard to you computer, a command such
as "tip -115200 tty00" (assuming tty00 is your serial port device) should
connect you to the board's console.
