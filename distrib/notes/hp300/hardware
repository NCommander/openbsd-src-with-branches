NetBSD/hp300 1.0 will run on most HP 9000/300 series machines.
The lowest amount of RAM that has been tested is 7.5M, though it
may run with less.  Certainly, if you wish to run X, more RAM is
recommended.  Until you reach 16M, more RAM is more important than
a faster CPU.

Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
	partition:	advise	needed
	root (/)	15M	15M	(see note below)
	user (/usr)	80M	45M
	swap		----- 2M for every 1M of RAM -----
	local (/local)	up to you

NOTE:  Because of the nature of the hp300 bootstrap procedure, the root
filesystem is a _fixed_size_!  You may want to consider placing /var and
/tmp on their own partitions.  This, of course is up to you and your
judgement.  Also, note that the recommended size of /usr is 15M greater
than the needed size.  This is to allow room for kernel source and
compile areas, as you may want to compile your own kernel.
