The hp300-specific portion of the OpenBSD 2.2 release is found in the
"hp300" subdirectory of the distribution.  That subdirectory is laid
out as follows:

.../2.2/hp300/
		INSTALL.hp300	Installation notes; this file.

		CKSUM		Output of the cksum(1) and md5(1) programs
		MD5		usable for verification of the correctness
				of downloaded files.

		*.tar.gz	hp300 binary distribution sets;
				see below.

		bsd		A stock GENERIC kernel.

		bsd-dl		A GENERIC kernel without any support for
				disk devices.

		bsd-rd		A compressed RAMDISK kernel; the embedded
				filesystem contains the installation tools.

		SYS_UBOOT	Unified boot file, used for booting from
				the network.

		HP-IB.geometry	A file containing geometry for some HP-IB
				disk drives.

		uboot.raw	Raw boot file, used internally for booting
				from the CDROM.

The OpenBSD/hp300 binary distribution sets contain the binaries which
comprise the OpenBSD 2.2 release for the hp300.  There are seven binary
distribution tar sets.  They may be found in the top of the "hp300"
subdirectory of the OpenBSD 2.2 distribution tree, and are as follows:

	base22	The OpenBSD/hp300 2.2 base binary distribution.  You
		MUST install this distribution set.  It contains the
		base OpenBSD utilities that are necessary for the
		system to run and be minimally functional.  It
		includes shared library support, and excludes
		everything described below.
		[ 11.2M gzipped, 33.9M uncompressed ]

	comp22	The OpenBSD/hp300 Compiler tools.  All of the tools
		relating to C and C++.  This set includes the system
		include files (/usr/include), the linker, the compiler
		tool chain, and the various system libraries (except
		the shared libraries, which are included as part of the
		base set).  This set also includes the manual pages for
		all of the utilities it contains, as well as the system
		call and library manual pages.
		[ 7.0M gzipped, 22.5M uncompressed ]

	etc22	This distribution set contains the system configuration
		files that reside in /etc and in several other places.
		This set MUST be installed if you are installing the
		system from scratch, but should NOT be used if you are
		upgrading.  (If you are upgrading, it's recommended that
		you get a copy of this set and CAREFULLY upgrade your
		configuration files by hand.)
		[ 94K gzipped, 500K uncompressed ]

	games22	This set includes the games and their manual pages.
		[ 2.7M gzipped, 6.7M uncompressed ]

	man22	This set includes all of the manual pages for the
		binaries and other software contained in the base set.
		Note that it does not include any of the manual pages
		that are included in the other sets.
		[ 2.4M gzipped, 9.2M uncompressed ]

	misc22	This set includes the system dictionaries (which are
		rather large), the typesettable document set, and
		man pages for other architectures which happen to be
		installed from the source tree by default.
		[ 1.7M gzipped, 5.8M uncompressed ]

	text22	This set includes OpenBSD's text processing tools,
		including groff, all related programs, and their
		manual pages.
		[ 945.9K gzipped, 3.5M uncompressed ]
