**** NOTE ****

A valid MBR for an OpenBSD bootable disk must contain at least:

a) One OpenBSD (id 'A6') partition.

Current partition information is:

$(fdisk $_disk)

Here is the MBR configuration you chose:

$(fdisk $_disk)

Please take note of the offsets and sizes of any DOS partitions, the OpenBSD
partition, and any other partitions you want to access from OpenBSD. You may
need this information to fill in the OpenBSD disklabel.
