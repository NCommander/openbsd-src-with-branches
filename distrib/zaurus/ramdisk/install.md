$_disk must be partitioned using an BSD or an MBR partition table.

BSD partition table or MBR partition tables can be created by openbsd.
It is more a question of firmware compatiblity disk portability.

No special setup should be required to label using BSD disklabel.
however if the disk has previously been partitioned in another
manner, it may be necessary to wipe existing partition tables
before proceeding.

You *MUST* setup the OpenBSD disklabel to include the MSDOS-formatted boot
partition as the 'i' partition. If the 'i' partition is missing or not the
MSDOS-formatted boot partition, then the kernel required to boot
OpenBSD cannot be installed.
