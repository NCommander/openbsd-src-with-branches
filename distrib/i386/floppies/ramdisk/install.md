A single OpenBSD partition with id "A6" should exist in the MBR.
It should be the only partition marked as active.  Furthermore, the
partitions must NOT overlap each others.  fdisk will be started in
edit mode, and you will be able to add this information as needed.
If you make a mistake, exit fdisk without storing the new information,
and you will be allowed to start over.

Here is an example of what the partition information will look like once
you have entered the disklabel editor. Disk partition sizes and offsets
are in sector (most likely 512 bytes) units. Make sure these size/offset
pairs are on cylinder boundaries (the number of sector per cylinder is
given in the `sectors/cylinder' entry, which is not shown here).

Also, if this disk is shared with other operating systems and have a BIOS
partition table, make sure all file systems reserved for OpenBSD are within
the offset and size specified in the BIOS partition table.

Do not change any parameters except the partition layout and the label name.

[Example]
16 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize   cpg]
  a:    50176        0    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl.    0 - 111)
  b:    64512    50176      swap                        # (Cyl.  112 - 255)
  c:   640192        0   unknown                        # (Cyl.    0 - 1428)
  d:   525504   114688    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl.  256 - 1428)

This program is designed to help you put OpenBSD on your disk,
in a simple and rational way.  You'll be asked several questions,
and it would probably be useful to have your disk's hardware
manual, the installation notes, and a calculator handy.
__welcome_banner_1

	else
		echo ""
		echo "Welcome to the OpenBSD/i386 ${VERSION} upgrade program."
		cat << \__welcome_banner_2

This program is designed to help you upgrade your OpenBSD system in a
simple and rational way.

As a reminder, installing the `etc' binary set is NOT recommended.
Once the rest of your system has been upgraded, you should manually
merge any changes to files in the `etc' set into those files which
already exist on your system.

cat << \__welcome_banner_3

As with anything which modifies your disk's contents, this
program can cause SIGNIFICANT data loss, and you are advised
to make sure your data is backed up before beginning the
installation process.

Default answers are displayed in brackets after the questions.
You can hit Control-C at any time to quit, but if you do so at a
prompt, you may have to hit return.  Also, quitting in the middle of
installation may leave your system in an inconsistent state.

OK, then.  Enter `halt' at the prompt to halt the machine.  Once the
machine has halted, power-cycle the system to load new boot code.

CONGRATULATIONS!  You have successfully $what OpenBSD!
To boot the installed system, enter halt at the command prompt. Once the
system has halted, reset the machine and boot from the disk.
