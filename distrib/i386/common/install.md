A single OpenBSD partition with id 'A6' ('OpenBSD') should exist in the MBR.
All of your OpenBSD partitions will be contained _within_ this partition,
including your swap space.  In the normal case it should be the only partition
marked as active.  (Unless you are using a multiple-OS booter, but you can
adjust that later.)  Furthermore, the MBR partitions must NOT overlap each
other.  [If this is a new install, you are most likely going to want to type
the following fdisk commands: reinit, update, write, quit. Use the 'manual'
command to read a full description.]  The current partition information is:

Inside the BIOS 'A6' ('OpenBSD') partition you just created, there resides an
OpenBSD partition table which defines how this BIOS partition is to be split
up. This table declares the offsets and sizes of your / partition, your swap
space, and any other partitions you might create.  (NOTE: The OpenBSD disk
label offsets are absolute, ie. relative to the start of the disk... NOT
relative to the start of the BIOS 'A6' partition).

	# display example
	cat << __EOT
If this disk is shared with other operating systems, those operating systems
should have a BIOS partition entry that spans the space they occupy completely.
For safety, also make sure all OpenBSD file systems are within the offset and
size specified in the 'A6' BIOS partition table.  (By default, the disklabel
editor will try to enforce this).  If you are unsure of how to use multiple
partitions properly (ie. separating /,  /usr, /tmp, /var, /usr/local, and other
things) just split the space into a root and swap partition for now.
