If you are unsure of how to use multiple partitions properly
(ie. separating /, /usr, /tmp, /var, /usr/local, and other things)
just split the space into a root and swap partition for now.

rational way.

		cat << \__welcome_banner_2

This program is designed to help you upgrade your OpenBSD system in a
simple and rational way.

As a reminder, installing the `etc' binary set is NOT recommended.
Once the rest of your system has been upgraded, you should manually
merge any changes to files in the `etc' set into those files which
already exist on your system.

cat << \__welcome_banner_3

As with anything which modifies your disk's contents, this program can
cause SIGNIFICANT data loss, and you are advised to make sure your
data is backed up before beginning the installation process.

Default answers are displayed in brackets after the questions.  You
can hit Control-C at any time to quit, but if you do so at a prompt,
you may have to hit return.  Also, quitting in the middle of
installation may leave your system in an inconsistent state.

machine has halted, power-cycle the system to load new boot code.

has halted, reset the machine and boot from the disk.
