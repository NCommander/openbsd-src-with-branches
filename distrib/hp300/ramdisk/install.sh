You will now have the opportunity to enter filesystem information.
You will be prompted for device name and mount point (full path,
including the prepending '/' character).

Note that these do not have to be in any particular order.  You will
be given the opportunity to edit the resulting 'fstab' file before
any of the filesystems are mounted.  At that time you will be able
to resolve any filesystem order dependencies.

# Get network configuration information, and store it for placement in the
# root filesystem later.
cat << \__network_config_1

You will now be given the opportunity to configure the network.  This will
be useful if you need to transfer the installation sets via FTP or NFS.
Even if you choose not to transfer installation sets that way, this
information will be preserved and copied into the new root filesystem.

Note, enter all symbolic host names WITHOUT the domain name appended.
I.e. use 'hostname' NOT 'hostname.domain.name'.

You will now be given the opportunity to escape to the command shell to
do any additional network configuration you may need.  This may include
adding additional routes, if needed.  In addition, you might take this
opportunity to redo the default route in the event that it failed above.
If you do change the default route, and wish for that change to carry over
to the installed system, execute the following command at the shell
prompt:

	echo <ip_address_of_gateway> > /tmp/mygate

where <ip_address_of_gateway> is the IP address of the default router.

You may wish to edit the fstab.  For example, you may need to resolve
dependencies in the order which the filesystems are mounted.  You may
also wish to take this opportunity to place NFS mounts in the fstab.
This would be especially useful if you plan to keep '/usr' on an NFS
server.
