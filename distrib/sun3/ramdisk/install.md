You will need to provide some information about your disk's geometry.
Geometry info for SCSI disks was printed at boot time.  If that information
is not available, use the information provided in your disk's manual.
Please note that the geometry printed at boot time is preferred.

IMPORTANT NOTE: due to a limitation in the disklabel(8) program, the
number of cylinders on the disk will be increased by 1 so that the initial
label can be placed on disk for editing.  When the disklabel editor appears,
make absolutely certain you subtract 1 from the total number of cylinders,
and adjust the size of partition 'c' such that:

	size = (sectors per track) * (tracks per cyl) * (total cylinders)

Note that the disklabel editor will be run twice; once to set the size of
partition 'c' and correct the geometry, and again so that you may correctly
edit the partition map.  This is to work around the afore mentioned
limitation in disklabel(8).  Apologies offered in advance.

	# `c' come out to (ncyl * ntracks_per_cyl * nsec_per_track).
	# After that's done, we re-open `c' and let the user actually
	# edit the partition table.  It's horrible, I know.  Bleh.

As with anything which modifies your disk's contents, this program can
cause SIGNIFICANT data loss, and you are advised to make sure your
data is backed up before beginning the installation process.

Default answers are displayed in brackets after the questions.  You
can hit Control-C at any time to quit, but if you do so at a prompt,
you may have to hit return.  Also, quitting in the middle of
installation may leave your system in an inconsistent state.
