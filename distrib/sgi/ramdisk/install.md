You will now create an OpenBSD disklabel. The disklabel must have an
'a' partition, being the space available for OpenBSD's root file system.
The 'p' partition must be retained since it contains the SGI Volume Header;
this in turn contains the boot loader. No other partitions should overlap
with the SGI Volume Header, which by default will use the first 3134 sectors.

Additionally, the 'a' partition must be the first partition on the disk,
immediately following the SGI Volume Header. If the default SGI Volume Header
size is used, the 'a' partition should be located at offset 3135. If the
'a' partition is not located immediately after the SGI Volume Header the
boot loader will not be able to locate and load the kernel.

Do not change any parameters except the partition layout and the label name.
