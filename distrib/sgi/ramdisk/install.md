A SGI Volume Header was found on the disk. Normally you want to replace it
with a new Volume Header suitable for installing OpenBSD. Doing this will
of course delete all data currently on the disk.

If the Volume Header was installed by a previous OpenBSD install keeping
it is OK as long as the Volume Header has room for the 'boot' program.
If you are trying to keep an old IRIX Volume Header, OpenBSD install will
use the 'a' partition on the disk for the install and any data in that
partition will be lost.

You will now create an OpenBSD disklabel. The default disklabel must have
an 'a' partition which is the space available for OpenBSD.
The 'i' partition must be retained since it contains the Volume Header and
the boot loader.

Do not change any parameters except the partition layout and the label name.
Also, don't change the 'i' partition or start any other partition below the
end of the 'i' partition. This is the Volume Header and destroying it will
render the disk useless.

Your machine is now set up to boot OpenBSD. Normally the ARCS PROM will
set up the system to boot from the first disk found with a valid Volume
Header. If the 'OSLoader' environment variable already is set to 'boot'
nothing in the firmware setup should need to be changed. To set up booting
refer to the install document.

To reboot the system, just enter 'reboot' at the shell prompt.
