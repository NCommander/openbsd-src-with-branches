.\"{{{  Description
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsh\fP is a reimplementation of the Bourne shell, a command
interpreter for both interactive and script use.
.\"{{{  Shell Startup
.SS "Shell Startup"
The following options can be specified only on the command line:
.IP "\fB\-c\fP \fIcommand-string\fP"
the shell executes the command(s) contained in \fIcommand-string\fP
.IP \fB\-i\fP
interactive mode \(em see below
.IP \fB\-l\fP
login shell \(em see below
interactive mode \(em see below
.IP \fB\-s\fP
the shell reads commands from standard input; all non-option arguments
are positional parameters
.IP \fB\-r\fP
restricted mode \(em see below
.PP
In addition to the above, the options described in the \fBset\fP built-in
command can also be used on the command line.
.PP
If neither the \fB\-c\fP nor the \fB\-s\fP options are specified, the
first non-option argument specifies the name of a file the shell reads
commands from; if there are no non-option arguments, the shell reads
commands from standard input.
The name of the shell (\fIi.e.\fP, the contents of the \fB$0\fP) parameter
is determined as follows: if the \fB\-c\fP option is used and there is
a non-option argument, it is used as the name; if commands are being
read from a file, the file is used as the name; otherwise the name
the shell was called with (\fIi.e.\fP, argv[0]) is used.
.PP
A shell is \fBinteractive\fP if the \fB\-i\fP option is used or
if both standard input and standard error are attached to a tty.
An interactive shell has job control enabled (if available),
ignores the INT, QUIT and TERM signals, and prints prompts before
reading input (see \fBPS1\fP and \fBPS2\fP parameters).
For non-interactive shells, the \fBtrackall\fP option is on by default
(see \fBset\fP command below).
.PP
A shell is \fBrestricted\fP if the \fB\-r\fP option is used or if either
the basename of the name the shell is invoked with or the \fBSHELL\fP
parameter match the pattern *r*sh (\fIe.g.\fP, rsh, rksh, rpdksh, \fIetc.\fP).
The following restrictions come into effect after the shell processes
any profile and \fB$ENV\fP files:
.nr P2 \n(PD
.nr PD 0
.IP \ \ \(bu
the \fBcd\fP command is disabled
.IP \ \ \(bu
the \fBSHELL\fP, \fBENV\fP and \fBPATH\fP parameters can't be changed
.IP \ \ \(bu
command names can't be specified with absolute or relative paths
.IP \ \ \(bu
the \fB\-p\fP option of the \fBcommand\fP built-in can't be used
.IP \ \ \(bu
redirections that create files can't be used (\fIi.e.\fP, \fB>\fP,
\fB>|\fP, \fB>>\fP, \fB<>\fP)
.nr PD \n(P2
.PP
A shell is \fBprivileged\fP if the \fB\-p\fP option is used or if
the real user-id or group-id does not match the effective user-id
or group-id (see \fIgetuid\fP(2), \fIgetgid\fP(2)).
A privileged shell does not process $HOME/.profile nor the \fBENV\fP
parameter (see below), instead the file /etc/suid_profile is processed.
Clearing the privileged option causes the shell to set its effective
user-id (group-id) to its real user-id (group-id).
.PP
If the basename of the name the shell is called with (\fIi.e.\fP, argv[0])
starts with \fB\-\fP or if the \fB\-l\fP option is used, the shell is assumed
to be a login shell and the shell reads and executes the contents of
\fB/etc/profile\fP and \fB$HOME/.profile\fP if they exist and are readable.
.PP
If the \fBENV\fP parameter is set when the shell starts (or, in the
case of login shells, after any profiles are processed), its value
is subjected to parameter, command, arithmetic and tilde substitution and
the resulting file (if any) is read and executed.
If \fBENV\fP parameter is not set (and not null) and pdksh was compiled
with the \fBDEFAULT_ENV\fP macro defined, the file named in that macro
is included (after the above mentioned substitutions have been performed).
.PP
The exit status of the shell is 127 if the command file specified
on the command line could not be opened, or non-zero if a fatal syntax
error occurred during the execution of a script.
In the absence of fatal errors, the exit status is that of the last
command executed, or zero, if no command is executed.
.\"}}}
.\"{{{  Command Syntax
.SS "Command Syntax"
.\"{{{  words and tokens
The shell begins parsing its input by breaking it into \fIword\fPs.
Words, which are sequences of characters, are delimited by unquoted
\fIwhite-space\fP characters (space, tab and newline) or \fImeta-characters\fP
(\fB<\fP, \fB>\fP, \fB|\fP, \fB;\fP, \fB&\fP, \fB(\fP and \fB)\fP).
Aside from delimiting words, spaces and tabs are ignored, while
newlines usually delimit commands.
The meta-characters are used in building the following tokens:
\fB<\fP, \fB<&\fP, \fB<<\fP, \fB>\fP, \fB>&\fP, \fB>>\fP, \fIetc.\fP are
used to specify redirections (see Input/Output Redirection below);
\fB|\fP is used to create pipelines;
\fB;\fP is used to separate commands;
\fB&\fP is used to create asynchronous pipelines;
\fB&&\fP and \fB||\fP are used to specify conditional execution;
\fB;;\fP is used in \fBcase\fP statements;
and lastly,
\fB(\fP .. \fB)\fP are used to create subshells.
.PP
White-space and meta-characters can be quoted individually using
backslash (\fB\e\fP), or in groups using double (\fB"\fP) or single (\fB'\fP)
quotes.
Note that the following characters are also treated specially by the shell and
must be quoted if they are to represent themselves:
\fB\e\fP, \fB"\fP, \fB'\fP, \fB#\fP, \fB$\fP, \fB`\fP, \fB~\fP, \fB{\fP,
\fB}\fP, \fB*\fP, \fB?\fP and \fB[\fP.
The first three of these are the above mentioned quoting characters
(see Quoting below);
\fB#\fP, if used at the beginning of a word, introduces a comment \(em everything
after the \fB#\fP up to the nearest newline is ignored;
\fB$\fP is used to introduce parameter, command and arithmetic substitutions
(see Substitution below);
\fB`\fP introduces an old-style command substitution
(see Substitution below);
\fB~\fP begins a directory expansion (see Tilde Expansion below);
\fB{\fP and \fB}\fP delimit \fIcsh\fP(1) style alternations
(see Brace Expansion below);
and, finally, \fB*\fP, \fB?\fP and \fB[\fP are used in file name generation
(see File Name Patterns below).
.\"}}}
.\"{{{  simple-command
.PP
As words and tokens are parsed, the shell builds commands, of which
there are two basic types: \fIsimple-commands\fP, typically programs
that are executed, and \fIcompound-commands\fP, such as \fBfor\fP and
\fBif\fP statements, grouping constructs and function definitions.
.PP
A simple-command consists of some combination of parameter assignments (see
Parameters below), input/output redirections (see Input/Output Redirections
below), and command words; the only restriction is that parameter assignments
come before any command words.
The command words, if any, define the command that is to be executed and its
arguments.
The command may be a shell built-in command, a function or an \fIexternal
command\fP, \fIi.e.\fP, a separate executable file that is located using the
\fBPATH\fP parameter (see Command Execution below).
Note that all command constructs have an \fIexit status\fP: for external
commands, this is related to the status returned by \fIwait\fP(2) (if the
command could not be found, the exit status is 127, if it could not be
executed, the exit status is 126);
the exit status of other command constructs (built-in commands, functions,
compound-commands, pipelines, lists, \fIetc.\fP) are all well defined and are
described where the construct is described.
The exit status of a command consisting only of parameter assignments is that
of the last command substitution performed during the parameter assignment
or zero if there were no command substitutions.
.\"}}}
.\"{{{  pipeline
.PP
Commands can be chained together using the \fB|\fP token to
form \fIpipelines\fP, in which the standard output of each command but
the last is piped (see \fIpipe\fP(2)) to the standard input of the following
command.
The exit status of a pipeline is that of its last command.
A pipeline may be prefixed by the \fB!\fP reserved word which
causes the exit status of the pipeline to be logically
complemented: if the original status was 0 the complemented status will
be 1, and if the original status was not 0, then the complemented
status will be 0.
.\"}}}
.\"{{{  lists
.PP
\fILists\fP of commands can be created by separating pipelines by
any of the following tokens: \fB&&\fP, \fB||\fP, \fB&\fP, \fB|&\fP and \fB;\fP.
The first two are for conditional execution: \fIcmd1\fP \fB&&\fP \fIcmd2\fP
executes \fIcmd2\fP only if the exit status of \fIcmd1\fP is zero;
\fB||\fP is the opposite \(em \fIcmd2\fP is executed only if the exit status
of \fIcmd1\fP is non-zero.
\fB&&\fP and \fB||\fP have equal precedence which is higher than that of
\fB&\fP, \fB|&\fP and \fB;\fP, which also have equal precedence.
The \fB&\fP token causes the preceding command to be executed asynchronously,
that is, the shell starts the command, but does not wait for it to complete
(the shell does keep track of the status of asynchronous commands \(em see
Job Control below).
When an asynchronous command is started when job control is disabled
(\fIi.e.\fP, in most scripts), the command is started with signals INT
and QUIT ignored and with input redirected from /dev/null
(however, redirections specified in the asynchronous command have precedence).
Note that a command must follow the \fB&&\fP and \fB||\fP operators, while
a command need not follow \fB&\fP, \fB|&\fP and \fB;\fP.
The exit status of a list is that of the last command executed, with the
exception of asynchronous lists, for which the exit status is 0.
.\"}}}
.\"{{{  compound-commands
.PP
Compound commands are created using the following reserved words \(em these
words are only recognized if they are unquoted and if they are used as
the first word of a command (\fIi.e.\fP, they can't be preceded by parameter
assignments or redirections):
.TS
center;
lfB lfB lfB lfB lfB .
case	else	function	then	!
do	esac	if	time	[[
done	fi	in	until	{
elif	for	select	while	}
.TE
\fBNote:\fP Some shells (but not this one) execute control structure commands
in a subshell when one or more of their file descriptors are redirected, so
any environment changes inside them may fail.
To be portable, the \fBexec\fP statement should be used instead to redirect
file descriptors before the control structure.
.PP
In the following compound command descriptions, command lists (denoted as
\fIlist\fP) that are followed by reserved words must end with a
semi-colon, a newline or a (syntactically correct) reserved word.
For example,
.RS
\fB{ echo foo; echo bar; }\fP
.br
\fB{ echo foo; echo bar<newline>}\fP
.br
\fB{ { echo foo; echo bar; } }\fP
.RE
are all valid, but
.RS
\fB{ echo foo; echo bar }\fP
.RE
is not.
.\"{{{  ( list )

The \fBcase\fP statement attempts to match \fIword\fP against the specified
\fIpattern\fPs; the \fIlist\fP associated with the first successfully matched
pattern is executed.  Patterns used in \fBcase\fP statements are the same as
those used for file name patterns except that the restrictions regarding
\fB\&.\fP and \fB/\fP are dropped.  Note that any unquoted space before and
after a pattern is stripped; any space with a pattern must be quoted.  Both the
word and the patterns are subject to parameter, command, and arithmetic
substitution as well as tilde substitution.
For historical reasons, open and close braces may be used instead
of \fBin\fP and \fBesac\fP (\fIe.g.\fP, \fBcase $foo { *) echo bar; }\fP).
The exit status of a \fBcase\fP statement is that of the executed \fIlist\fP;
if no \fIlist\fP is executed, the exit status is zero.

where \fIterm\fP is either a newline or a \fB;\fP.
For each \fIword\fP in the specified word list, the parameter \fIname\fP is
set to the word and \fIlist\fP is executed.  If \fBin\fP is not used to
specify a word list, the positional parameters (\fB"$1"\fP, \fB"$2"\fP,
\fIetc.\fP) are used instead.
For historical reasons, open and close braces may be used instead
of \fBdo\fP and \fBdone\fP (\fIe.g.\fP, \fBfor i; { echo $i; }\fP).
The exit status of a \fBfor\fP statement is the last exit status
of \fIlist\fP; if \fIlist\fP is never executed, the exit status is zero.

If the exit status of the first \fIlist\fP is zero, the second \fIlist\fP

.\"{{{  Quoting
.SS Quoting
Quoting is used to prevent the shell from treating characters or words
specially.
There are three methods of quoting: First, \fB\e\fP quotes
the following character, unless it is at the end of a line, in which
case both the \fB\e\fP and the newline are stripped.
Second, a single quote (\fB'\fP) quotes everything up to the next single
quote (this may span lines).
Third, a double quote (\fB"\fP) quotes all characters,
except \fB$\fP, \fB`\fP and \fB\e\fP, up to the next unquoted double quote.
\fB$\fP and \fB`\fP inside double quotes have their usual meaning (\fIi.e.\fP,
parameter, command or arithmetic substitution) except no field splitting
is carried out on the results of double-quoted substitutions.
If a \fB\e\fP inside a double-quoted string is followed by \fB\e\fP, \fB$\fP,
\fB`\fP or \fB"\fP, it is replaced by the second character; if it is
followed by a newline, both the \fB\e\fP and the newline are stripped;
otherwise, both the \fB\e\fP and the character following are unchanged.
.PP
Note: see POSIX Mode below for a special rule regarding sequences
of the form \fB"\fP...\fB`\fP...\fB\e"\fP...\fB`\fP..\fB"\fP.
.\"}}}
.\"{{{  Aliases
.SS "Aliases"
There are two types of aliases: normal command aliases and tracked
aliases.  Command aliases are normally used as a short hand for a long
or often used command.  The shell expands command aliases (\fIi.e.\fP,
substitutes the alias name for its value) when it reads the first word
of a command.  An expanded alias is re-processed to check for more
aliases.  If a command alias ends in a space or tab, the following word
is also checked for alias expansion.  The alias expansion process stops
when a word that is not an alias is found, when a quoted word is found
or when an alias word that is currently being expanded is found.
.PP
The following command aliases are defined automatically by the shell:
.ft B
.RS
hash='alias \-t'
.br
type='whence \-v'
.RE
.ft P
.PP
Tracked aliases allow the shell to remember where it found a particular
command.  The first time the shell does a path search for a command that
is marked as a tracked alias, it saves the full path of the command.
The next time the command is executed, the shell checks the saved path
to see that it is still valid, and if so, avoids repeating the path
search.  Tracked aliases can be listed and created using \fBalias
\-t\fP.  Note that changing the \fBPATH\fP parameter clears the saved
paths for all tracked aliases.  If the \fBtrackall\fP option is set (\fIi.e.\fP,
\fBset \-o trackall\fP or \fBset \-h\fP), the shell tracks all
commands.  This option is set automatically for non-interactive shells.
For interactive shells, only the following commands are automatically
tracked: \fBcat\fP, \fBcc\fP, \fBchmod\fP, \fBcp\fP, \fBdate\fP, \fBed\fP,
\fBemacs\fP, \fBgrep\fP, \fBls\fP, \fBmail\fP, \fBmake\fP, \fBmv\fP,
\fBpr\fP, \fBrm\fP, \fBsed\fP, \fBsh\fP, \fBvi\fP and \fBwho\fP.
.\"}}}
.\"{{{  Substitution
.SS "Substitution"
The first step the shell takes in executing a simple-command is to
perform substitutions on the words of the command.
There are three kinds of substitution: parameter, command and arithmetic.
Parameter substitutions, which are described in detail in the next section,
take the form \fB$name\fP or \fB${\fP...\fB}\fP; command substitutions take
the form \fB$(\fP\fIcommand\fP\fB)\fP or \fB`\fP\fIcommand\fP\fB`\fP;
and arithmetic substitutions take the form \fB$((\fP\fIexpression\fP\fB))\fP.
.PP
If a substitution appears outside of double quotes, the results of the
substitution are generally subject to word or field splitting according to
the current value of the \fBIFS\fP parameter.
The \fBIFS\fP parameter specifies a list of characters which 
are used to break a string up into several words;
any characters from the set space, tab and newline that appear in the
IFS characters are called \fIIFS white space\fP.
Sequences of one or more IFS white space characters, in combination with
zero or one non-IFS white space characters delimit a field.
As a special case, leading and trailing IFS white space is stripped (\fIi.e.\fP,
no leading or trailing empty field is created by it); leading or trailing
non-IFS white space does create an empty field.
.PP
Example: if \fBIFS\fP is set to `<space>:', and VAR is set to 
`<space>A<space>:<space><space>B::D', the substitution for $VAR results
in four fields: `A', `B', `' and `D'.
Note that if the \fBIFS\fP parameter is set to the null string, no
field splitting is done; if the parameter is unset, the default value
of space, tab and newline is used.
.PP
Also, note that the field splitting applies only to immediate result of
the substitution.  Using the previous example, the substitution for $VAR:E
results in the fields: `A', `B', `' and `D:E', not `A', `B', `', `D' and `E'.
This behavior is POSIX compliant, but incompatible with some other shell
implementations which do field splitting on the word which contained the
substitution or use \fBIFS\fP\ as a general whitespace delimiter.
.PP
The results of substitution are, unless otherwise specified, also subject
to brace expansion and file name expansion (see the relevant sections
below).
.PP
A command substitution is replaced by the output generated by the specified
command, which is run in a subshell.
For \fB$(\fP\fIcommand\fP\fB)\fP substitutions, normal quoting rules
are used when \fIcommand\fP is parsed, however, for the
\fB`\fP\fIcommand\fP\fB`\fP form, a \fB\e\fP followed by any of
\fB$\fP, \fB`\fP or \fB\e\fP is stripped (a \fB\e\fP followed by any other
character is unchanged).
As a special case in command substitutions, a command of the form
\fB<\fP \fIfile\fP is interpreted to mean substitute the contents
of \fIfile\fP ($(< foo) has the same effect as $(cat foo), but it
is carried out more efficiently because no process is started).
.br
.\"todo: fix this( $(..) parenthesis counting).
NOTE: \fB$(\fP\fIcommand\fP\fB)\fP expressions are currently parsed by
finding the matching parenthesis, regardless of quoting.  This will hopefully
be fixed soon.
.PP
Arithmetic substitutions are replaced by the value of the specified
expression.
For example, the command \fBecho $((2+3*4))\fP prints 14.
See Arithmetic Expressions for a description of an \fIexpression\fP.
.\"}}}
.\"{{{  Parameters
.SS "Parameters"
Parameters are shell variables; they can be assigned values and
their values can be accessed using a parameter substitution.
A parameter name is either one of the special single punctuation or digit
character parameters described below, or a letter followed by zero or more
letters or digits (`_' counts as a letter).
Parameter substitutions take the form \fB$\fP\fIname\fP or
\fB${\fP\fIname\fP\fB}\fP, where \fIname\fP is a parameter name.
If substitution is performed on a parameter that is not set, a null
string is substituted unless the \fBnounset\fP option (\fBset \-o nounset\fP
or \fBset \-u\fP) is set, in which case an error occurs.
.PP
.\"{{{  parameter assignment
Parameters can be assigned values in a number of ways.
First, the shell implicitly sets some parameters like \fB#\fP, \fBPWD\fP,
etc.; this is the only way the special single character parameters are
set.
Second, parameters are imported from the shell's environment at startup.
Third, parameters can be assigned values on the command line, for example,
`\fBFOO=bar\fP' sets the parameter FOO to bar; multiple parameter
assignments can be given on a single command line and they can
be followed by a simple-command, in which case the assignments are
in effect only for the duration of the command (such assignments are
also exported, see below for implications of this).
Note that both the parameter name and the \fB=\fP must be unquoted for
the shell to recognize a parameter assignment.
The fourth way of setting a parameter is with the \fBexport\fP, \fBreadonly\fP
and \fBtypeset\fP commands; see their descriptions in the Command Execution
section.
Fifth, \fBfor\fP and \fBselect\fP loops set parameters as well as
the \fBgetopts\fP, \fBread\fP and \fBset \-A\fP commands.
Lastly, parameters can be assigned values using assignment operators
inside arithmetic expressions (see Arithmetic Expressions below) or
using the \fB${\fP\fIname\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP\fB}\fP form
of parameter substitution (see below).
.\"}}}
.PP
.\"{{{  environment
Parameters with the export attribute (set using the \fBexport\fP or
\fBtypeset \-x\fP commands, or by parameter assignments followed by simple
commands) are put in the environment (see \fIenviron\fP(5)) of commands
run by the shell as \fIname\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP pairs.
The order in which parameters appear in the environment of a command
is unspecified.
When the shell starts up, it extracts parameters and their values from its
environment and automatically sets the export attribute for those parameters.
.\"}}}
.\"{{{  ${name[:][-+=?]word}
.PP
Modifiers can be applied to the \fB${\fP\fIname\fP\fB}\fP form of parameter
substitution:
.IP \fB${\fP\fIname\fP\fB:-\fP\fIword\fP\fB}\fP
if \fIname\fP is set and not null, it is substituted, otherwise \fIword\fP is
substituted.
.IP \fB${\fP\fIname\fP\fB:+\fP\fIword\fP\fB}\fP

.IP \fB${\fP\fIname\fP\fB:=\fP\fIword\fP\fB}\fP
if \fIname\fP is set and not null, it is substituted, otherwise it is
assigned \fIword\fP and the resulting value of \fIname\fP is substituted.
.IP \fB${\fP\fIname\fP\fB:?\fP\fIword\fP\fB}\fP
if \fIname\fP is set and not null, it is substituted, otherwise \fIword\fP

If \fIpattern\fP matches the beginning of the value of parameter \fIname\fP,
the matched text is deleted from the result of substitution.  A single
\fB#\fP results in the shortest match, two \fB#\fP's results in the
longest match.

.SS "Tilde Expansion"
Tilde expansion, which is done in parallel with parameter substitution,
is done on words starting with an unquoted \fB~\fP.  The characters
following the tilde, up to the first \fB/\fP, if any, are assumed to be
a login name.  If the login name is empty, \fB+\fP or \fB\-\fP, the
value of the \fBHOME\fP, \fBPWD\fP, or \fBOLDPWD\fP parameter is
substituted, respectively.  Otherwise, the password file is searched for
the login name, and the tilde expression is substituted with the
user's home directory.  If the login name is not found in the password
file or if any quoting or parameter substitution occurs in the login name,
no substitution is performed.
.PP
In parameter assignments (those preceding a simple-command or those
occurring in the arguments of \fBalias\fP, \fBexport\fP, \fBreadonly\fP,
and \fBtypeset\fP), tilde expansion is done after any unquoted colon
(\fB:\fP), and login names are also delimited by colons.
.PP
The home directory of previously expanded login names are cached and

.SS "File Name Patterns"
.PP
A file name pattern is a word containing one or more unquoted \fB?\fP or

been performed, the shell replaces file name patterns with the sorted names
of all the files that match the pattern (if no files match, the word is
left unchanged).  The pattern elements have the following meaning:
.IP \fB?\fP
matches any single character.
.IP \fB*\fP
matches any sequence of characters.
.IP \fB[\fP..\fB]\fP
matches any of the characters inside the brackets.  Ranges of characters
can be specified by separating two characters by a \fB\-\fP, \fIe.g.\fP,
\fB[a0\-9]\fP matches the letter \fBa\fP or any digit.
In order to represent itself, a
\fB\-\fP must either be quoted or the first or last character in the character
list.  Similarly, a \fB]\fP must be quoted or the first character in the list
if it is represent itself instead of the end of the list.  Also, a \fB!\fP
appearing at the start of the list has special meaning (see below), so to
represent itself it must be quoted or appear later in the list.
.IP \fB[!\fP..\fB]\fP
like \fB[\fP..\fB]\fP, except it matches any character not inside the brackets.
.PP
Note that pdksh currently never matches \fB.\fP and \fB..\fP, but the original
ksh, Bourne sh and bash do, so this may have to change (too bad).
.PP
Note that none of the above pattern elements match either a period (\fB.\fP)
at the start of a file name or a slash (\fB/\fP), even if they are explicitly
used in a \fB[\fP..\fB]\fP sequence; also, the names \fB.\fP and \fB..\fP
are never matched, even by the pattern \fB.*\fP.

.\"{{{  Input/Output Redirection
.SS "Input/Output Redirection"
When a command is executed, its standard input, standard output and
standard error (file descriptors 0, 1 and 2, respectively) are normally
inherited from the shell.
Three exceptions to this are commands in pipelines, for which standard input
and/or standard output are those set up by the pipeline, asynchronous commands
created when job control is disabled, for which standard input is initially
set to be from \fB/dev/null\fP, and commands for which any of the following
redirections have been specified:
.IP "\fB>\fP \fIfile\fP"
standard output is redirected to \fIfile\fP.  If \fIfile\fP does not exist,
it is created; if it does exist, is a regular file and the \fBnoclobber\fP
option is set, an error occurs, otherwise the file is truncated.
Note that this means the command \fIcmd < foo > foo\fP will open
\fIfoo\fP for reading and then truncate it when it opens it for writing,
before \fIcmd\fP gets a chance to actually read \fIfoo\fP.
.IP "\fB>|\fP \fIfile\fP"
same as \fB>\fP, except the file is truncated, even if the \fBnoclobber\fP
option is set.
.IP "\fB>>\fP \fIfile\fP"
same as \fB>\fP, except the file an existing file is appended to instead
of being truncated.  Also, the file is opened in append mode, so writes
always go to the end of the file (see \fIopen\fP(2)).
.IP "\fB<\fP \fIfile\fP"
standard input is redirected from \fIfile\fP, which is opened for reading.
.IP "\fB<>\fP \fIfile\fP"
same as \fB<\fP, except the file is opened for reading and writing.
.IP "\fB<<\fP \fImarker\fP"
after reading the command line containing this kind of redirection (called a
here document), the shell copies lines from the command source into a temporary
file until a line matching \fImarker\fP is read.
When the command is executed, standard input is redirected from the temporary
file.
If \fImarker\fP contains no quoted characters, the contents of the
temporary file are processed as if enclosed in double quotes each time
the command is executed, so parameter, command and arithmetic substitutions
are performed, along with backslash (\fB\e\fP) escapes for
\fB$\fP, \fB`\fP, \fB\e\fP and \fB\enewline\fP.
If multiple here documents are used on the same command line, they are
saved in order.
.IP "\fB<<-\fP \fImarker\fP"
same as \fB<<\fP, except leading tabs are stripped from lines in the
here document.
.IP "\fB<&\fP \fIfd\fP"
standard input is duplicated from file descriptor \fIfd\fP.
\fIfd\fP can be a single digit, indicating the number of an existing
file descriptor, the letter \fBp\fP, indicating the file descriptor
associated with the output of the current co-process, or
the character \fB\-\fP, indicating standard input is to be closed.
.IP "\fB>&\fP \fIfd\fP"
same as \fB<&\fP, except the operation is done on standard output.
.PP
In any of the above redirections, the file descriptor that is redirected
(\fIi.e.\fP, standard input or standard output) can be explicitly given by
preceding the redirection with a single digit.
Parameter, command and arithmetic substitutions, tilde substitutions and
file name generation are all performed on the \fIfile\fP, \fImarker\fP and
\fIfd\fP arguments of redirections.
Note however, that the results of any file name generation are only used
if a single file is matched; if multiple files match, the word with the
unexpanded file name generation characters is used.
Note that in restricted shells, redirections which can create files cannot
be used.
.PP
For simple-commands, redirections may appear anywhere in the command, for
compound-commands (\fBif\fP statements, \fIetc.\fP), any redirections must
appear at the end.
Redirections are processed after pipelines are created and in the order they
are given, so
.RS
\fBcat /foo/bar 2>&1 > /dev/null | cat \-n\fP

will print an error with a line number prepended to it.

.\"{{{  Functions
.SS "Functions"
Functions are defined using either Korn shell \fBfunction\fP \fIname\fP
syntax or the Bourne/POSIX shell \fIname\fP\fB()\fP syntax
(see below for the difference between the two forms).
Functions are like \fB.\fP-scripts in that they are executed in
the current environment, however, unlike \fB.\fP-scripts, shell arguments
(\fIi.e.\fP, positional parameters, \fB$1\fP, \fIetc.\fP) are never visible
inside them.
When the shell is determining the location of a command, functions are
searched after special built-in commands, and before regular and non-regular
built-ins, and before the \fBPATH\fP is searched.
.PP
An existing function may be deleted using \fBunset \-f\fP \fIfunction-name\fP.
A list of functions can be obtained using \fBtypeset +f\fP and the
function definitions can be listed using \fBtypeset \-f\fP.
\fBautoload\fP (which is an alias for \fBtypeset \-fu\fP) may be used to
create undefined functions; when an undefined function is executed, the
shell searches the path specified in the \fBFPATH\fP parameter for a file
with the same name as the function, which, if found is read and executed.
If after executing the file, the named function is found to be defined, the
function is executed, otherwise, the normal command search is continued
(\fIi.e.\fP, the shell searches the regular built-in command table
and \fBPATH\fP).
Note that if a command is not found using \fBPATH\fP, an attempt is
made to autoload a function using \fBFPATH\fP (this is an undocumented
feature of the original Korn shell).
.PP
Functions can have two attributes, trace and export, which can be set
with \fBtypeset \-ft\fP and \fBtypeset \-fx\fP, respectively.
When a traced function is executed, the shell's \fBxtrace\fP option is turned
on for the functions duration, otherwise the \fBxtrace\fP option is turned off.
The export attribute of functions is currently not used.  In the original
Korn shell, exported functions are visible to shell scripts that are executed.
.PP
Since functions are executed in the current shell environment, parameter
assignments made inside functions are visible after the function completes.
If this is not the desired effect, the \fBtypeset\fP command can be used
inside a function to create a local parameter.
Note that special parameters (\fIe.g.\fP, \fB$$\fP, \fB$!\fP) can't be
scoped in this way.
.PP
The exit status of a function is that of the last command executed in
the function.
A function can be made to finish immediately using the \fBreturn\fP command;
this may also be used to explicitly specify the exit status.
.PP
Functions defined with the \fBfunction\fP reserved word are
treated differently in the following ways from functions defined with
the \fB()\fP notation:
.nr P2 \n(PD
.nr PD 0
.IP \ \ \(bu
the \fB$0\fP parameter is set to the name of the function
(Bourne-style functions leave \fB$0\fP untouched).
.IP \ \ \(bu
parameter assignments preceeding function calls are not kept in
the shell environment
(executing Bourne-style functions will keep assignments).
.IP \ \ \(bu
\fBOPTIND\fP is saved/reset and restored on entry and exit from the function
so \fBgetopts\fP can be used properly both inside and outside the function
(Bourne-style functions leave \fBOPTIND\fP untouched, so using \fBgetopts\fP
inside a function interferes with using \fBgetopts\fP outside the function).
.nr PD \n(P2
In the future, the following differences will also be added:
.nr P2 \n(PD
.nr PD 0
.IP \ \ \(bu
A separate trap/signal environment will be used during the execution of
functions.
This will mean that traps set inside a function will not affect the shell's
traps and signals that are not ignored in the shell (but may be trapped) will
have their default effect in a function.
.IP \ \ \(bu
The EXIT trap, if set in a function, will be executed after the function
returns.
.nr PD \n(P2
.\"}}}
.\"{{{  POSIX mode
.SS "POSIX Mode"
The shell is intended to be POSIX compliant, however, in some cases, POSIX
behaviour is contrary either to the original Korn shell behaviour or to
user convenience.
How the shell behaves in these cases is determined by the state of
the posix option (\fBset \-o posix\fP) \(em if it is on, the POSIX behaviour
is followed, otherwise it is not.
The \fBposix\fP option is set automatically when the shell starts up
if the environment contains the \fBPOSIXLY_CORRECT\fP parameter.
(The shell can also be compiled so that it is in POSIX mode by default,
however this is usually not desirable).
.PP
The following is a list of things that are affected by the state of
the \fBposix\fP option:
.nr P2 \n(PD
.nr PD 0
.IP \ \ \(bu
reading of \fB$ENV\fP: if not in posix mode, the \fBENV\fP parameter
is not expanded and included when the shell starts.
.IP \ \ \(bu
\fB\e"\fP inside double quoted \fB`\fP..\fB`\fP command substitutions:
in posix mode, the \fB\e"\fP is interpreted when the command is interpreted;
in non-posix mode, the backslash is stripped before the command substitution
is interpreted.  For example, \fBecho "`echo \e"hi\e"`"\fP produces `"hi"' in
posix mode, `hi' in non-posix mode.  To avoid problems, use the \fB$(...\fP)
form of command substitution.

.\"{{{  Command Execution (built-in commands)
.SS "Command Execution"
After evaluation of command line arguments, redirections and parameter
assignments, the type of command is determined: a special built-in,
a function, a regular built-in or the name of a file to execute found
using the \fBPATH\fP parameter.
The checks are made in the above order.
Special built-in commands differ from other commands in that 
the \fBPATH\fP parameter is not used to find them, an error
during their execution can cause a non-interactive shell to exit and
parameter assignments that are specified before the command are
kept after the command completes.
Just to confuse things, if the posix option is turned off (see \fBset\fP
command below) some special commands are very special in that
no field splitting, file globing, brace expansion nor tilde expansion
is preformed on arguments that look like assignments.
Regular built-in commands are different only in that the \fBPATH\fP
parameter is not used to find them.
.PP
The original ksh and POSIX differ somewhat in which commands are considered
special or regular:

In the future, the additional ksh special and regular commands may
be treated differently from the POSIX special and regular commands.
.PP
Once the type of the command has been determined, any command line parameter
assignments are performed and exported for the duration of the command.
.PP
The following describes the special and regular built-in commands:
.\"{{{  . file [ arg1 ... ]
.IP "\fB\&.\fP \fIfile\fP [\fIarg1\fP ...]"
Execute the commands in \fIfile\fP in the current environment.
The file is searched for in the directories of \fBPATH\fP.
If arguments are given, the positional parameters may be used to
access them while \fIfile\fP is being executed.
If no arguments are given, the positional parameters are those of the
environment the command is used in.

Without arguments, \fBalias\fP lists all aliases.
For any name without a value, the existing alias is listed.
Any name with a value defines an alias (see Aliases above).
.sp
When listing aliases, one of two formats is used: 
normally, aliases are listed as \fIname\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP, where
\fIvalue\fP is quoted; if options were preceded with \fB+\fP 
or a lone \fB+\fP is given on the command line, only \fIname\fP
is printed.
In addition, if the \fB\-p\fP option is used, each alias
is prefixed with the string "\fBalias\fP\ ".
.sp
The \fB\-x\fP option sets (\fB+x\fP clears) the export attribute of an alias,
or, if no names are given, lists the aliases with the export attribute
(exporting an alias has no affect).
.sp
The \fB\-x\fP option sets the export attribute of an alias, or, if no
names are given, lists the aliases with the export attribute
(exporting an alias currently has no affect).
.sp
The \fB\-t\fP option indicates that tracked aliases are to be listed/set
(values specified on the command line are ignored for tracked aliases).
The \fB\-r\fP option indicates that all tracked aliases are to be reset.
.sp
The \fB\-d\fP causes directory aliases, which are used in tilde expansion,
to be listed or set (see Tilde Expansion above).

Set the working directory to \fIdir\fP.  If the parameter \fBCDPATH\fP

null path means the current directory. If \fIdir\fP is found in any
component of the \fBCDPATH\fP search path other than the null path the name
of the new working directory will be written to standard output. If
\fIdir\fP is missing, the home directory \fB$HOME\fP is used.  If \fIdir\fP

assignments are not permanent).
If the \fB\-p\fP option is given, a default search path is used instead of

.\"{{{  getopts optstring name [arg ...]
.IP "\fBgetopts\fP \fIoptstring\fP \fIname\fP [\fIarg\fP ...]"
\fBgetopts\fP is used by shell procedures to parse the specified arguments
(or positional parameters, if no arguments are given) and to check for legal
options.
\fIoptstring\fP contains the option letters that
\fBgetopts\fP is to recognize.  If a letter is followed by a colon, the
option is expected to have an argument.
Options that do not take arguments may be grouped in a single argument.
If an option takes an argument and the option character is not the last
character of the argument it is found in, the remainder of the argument
is taken to be the option's argument, otherwise, the next argument is
the option's argument.
.sp
Each time \fBgetopts\fP is invoked, it places the next option in
the shell parameter \fIname\fP and the index of the next argument to be
processed in the shell parameter \fBOPTIND\fP.
If the option was introduced with a \fB+\fP, the option placed in
\fIname\fP is prefixed with a \fB+\fP.
When an option requires an argument, \fBgetopts\fP places it in the
shell parameter \fBOPTARG\fP.
When an illegal option or a missing option argument is
encountered a question mark or a colon is placed in \fIname\fP
(indicating an illegal option or missing argument, respectively)
and \fBOPTARG\fP is set to the option character that caused the problem.
An error message is also printed to standard error if \fIoptstring\fP
does not begin with a colon.
.sp
When the end of the options is encountered, \fBgetopts\fP exits with a
non-zero exit status.
Options end at the first (non-option argument) argument that does not
start with a \-, or when a \fB\-\-\fP argument is encountered.
.sp
Option parsing can be reset by setting \fBOPTIND\fP to 1 (this is done
automatically whenever the shell or a shell procedure is invoked).
.sp
Warning: Changing the value of the shell parameter \fBOPTIND\fP to
a value other than 1, or parsing different sets of arguments without
resetting \fBOPTIND\fP may lead to unexpected results.

\fBPrint\fP prints its arguments on the standard output, separated by
spaces, and terminated with a newline.  The \fB\-n\fP option suppresses
the newline.  By default, certain C escapes are translated.  These
include \eb, \ef, \en, \er, \et, \ev, and \e0### (# is an octal digit, of
which there may be 0 to 3).
\ec is equivalent to using the \fB\-n\fP option.  \e expansion may be

.\"{{{  job control (and its built-in commands)
.SS "Job Control"
Job control refers to the shell's ability to monitor and control \fBjobs\fP,
which are processes or groups of processes created for commands or pipelines.
At a minimum, the shell keeps track of the status of the background
(\fIi.e.\fP, asynchronous) jobs that currently exist; this information can be
displayed using the \fBjobs\fP command.
If job control is fully enabled (using \fBset \-m\fP or
\fBset \-o monitor\fP), as it is for interactive shells,
the processes of a job are placed in their own process group,
foreground jobs can be stopped by typing the suspend character from the
terminal (normally ^Z),
jobs can be restarted in either the foreground
or background, using the \fBfg\fP and \fBbg\fP commands, respectively,
and the state of the terminal is saved or restored when a foreground
job is stopped or restarted, respectively.
.sp
Note that only commands that create processes (\fIe.g.\fP,
asynchronous commands, subshell commands, and non-built-in,
non-function commands) can be stopped; commands like \fBread\fP cannot be.
.sp
When a job is created, it is assigned a job-number.
For interactive shells, this number is printed inside \fB[\fP..\fB]\fP,
followed by the process-ids of the processes in the job when an asynchronous
command is run.
A job may be referred to in \fBbg\fP, \fBfg\fP, \fBjobs\fP, \fBkill\fP and
\fBwait\fP commands either by the process id of the last process in the
command pipeline (as stored in the \fB$!\fP parameter) or by prefixing the
job-number with a percent sign (\fB%\fP).
Other percent sequences can also be used to refer to jobs:

.PP
When an attempt is made to exit the shell while there are jobs in
the stopped state, the shell warns the user that there are stopped jobs
and does not exit.
If another attempt is immediately made to exit the shell, the stopped
jobs are sent a \fBHUP\fP signal and the shell exits.
Similarly, if the \fBnohup\fP option is not set and there are running
jobs when an attempt is made to exit a login shell, the shell warns the

If another attempt is immediately made to exit the shell, the running
jobs are sent a \fBHUP\fP signal and the shell exits.

operating system and compiler you are using and a description of how to
repeat the bug (a small shell script that demonstrates the bug is
best).  The following, if relevant (if you are not sure, include them),
can also helpful: options you are using (both options.h options and set
\-o options) and a copy of your config.h (the file generated by the
configure script).  New versions of pdksh can be obtained from
ftp.cs.mun.ca:pub/pdksh/.
