Last updated Jul '99 for pdksh-5.2.14.

PD-ksh is a mostly complete AT&T ksh look-alike (see NOTES file for a list
of things not supported).  Work is mostly finished to make it fully
compatible with both POSIX and AT&T ksh (when the two don't conflict).

Since pdksh is free and compiles and runs on most common unix systems, it
is very useful in creating a consistent user interface across multiple
machines.

PDksh was being maintained by Michael Rendell (michael@cs.mun.ca),
who took over from Simon J. Gerraty (sjg@zen.void.oz.au) at the later's
suggestion.  A short list of things that have been added since the last
public pdksh release (4.9) are auto-configuration, arrays, $(( .. )),
[[ .. ]], variable attributes, co-processes, extended file globbing,
many POSIXisms and many bug fixes.  See the NEWS and ChangeLog files for
other features added and bugs fixed.

Note that pdksh is provided AS IS, with NO WARRANTY, either expressed or
implied.  Also note that although the bulk of the code in pdksh is in the
public domain, some files are copyrighten (but freely distributable) and
subject to certain conditions (eg, don't remove copyright, document any
changes, etc.).  See the LEGAL file for details.

Files of interest:
	CONTRIBUTORS	short history of pdksh, people who contributed, etc.
	NOTES		lists of known bugs in pdksh, at&t ksh, and posix.
	PROJECTS	list of things that need to be done in pdksh.
	BUG-REPORTS	list of recently reported bugs that have been fixed
			and all reported bugs that haven't been fixed.
	LEGAL		A file detailing legal issues concerning pdksh.
	etc/*		system profile and kshrc files used by Simon J. Gerraty.
	misc/README*	readme files from previous versions.
	misc/Changes*	changelog files from previous versions.
	os2/*		files and info needed to compile ksh on os/2.
	tests/*		pdksh's regression testing system.


If you are reporting a bug (with or without a fix), please include
	* the version of pdksh you are using (see version.c, or, if you are
	  running pdksh, try echo $KSH_VERSION),
	* the machine, operating system and compiler you are using,
	* and a description of how to repeat the bug (a small shell
	  script that demonstrates the bug is best).
as well as the following, if relevant (if you aren't sure, include them)
	* what options you are using (both configure options and set -o options)
	* the output of configure, with the verbose flag
	  (eg, make distclean; ./configure --verbose)
	* the contents of config.log (this is created by the configure script)
	* if you are using gcc (the GNU C compiler), which version it is.

BTW, THE MOST FREQUENTLY REPORTED BUG IS
	echo hi | read a; echo $a	# Does not print hi
I'm aware of this and there is no need to report it.
