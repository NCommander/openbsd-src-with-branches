.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm tar
command creates, adds files to, or extracts files from an
archive file in \*Qtar\*U format.  A tar archive is often

.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Fl c
Create new archive, or overwrite an existing archive,
adding the specified files to it.
.It Fl r
Append the named new files to existing archive.  Note that
this will only work on media on which an end-of-file mark
can be overwritten.
.It Fl t
List contents of archive.  If any files are named on the
command line, only those files will be listed.
.It Fl u
Alias for
.Fl r
.It Fl x
Extract files from archive.  If any files are named on the
command line, only those files will be extracted from the
archive.  If more than one copy of a file exists in the
archive, later copies will overwrite earlier copies during
extration.
.El

flags may be used:

10240 and 32256 may be used.

.Sh ERRORS
.Nm tar
will exit with one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width 2n
.It 0
All files were processed successfully.
.It 1
An error occured.
.El
.Pp
Whenever
.Nm tar
cannot create a file or a link when extracting an archive or cannot
find a file while writing an archive, or cannot preserve the user
ID, group ID, file mode or access and modification times when the
.Fl p
options is specified, a diagnostic message is written to standard
error and a non-zero exit value will be returned, but processing
will continue.  In the case where
.Nm tar
cannot create a link to a file,
.Nm tar
will not create a second copy of the file.
.Pp
If the extraction of a file from an archive is prematurely terminated
by a signal or error,
.Nm tar
may have only partially extracted the file the user wanted.
Additionally, the file modes of extracted files and directories may
have incorrect file bits, and the modification and access times may
be wrong.
.Pp
If the creation of an archive is prematurely terminated by a signal
or error,
.Nm tar
may have only partially created the archive which may violate the
specific archive format specification.
