.Nm kill
.Fl signal_name
.Ar pid

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility sends a signal to the process(es) specified
by the
.Ar pid
operand(s).
If no signal is specified,
.Dv SIGTERM
is used.
.Pp
Only the super-user may send signals to other users' processes.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl s Ar signal_name
A symbolic signal name specifying the signal to be sent instead of the
default
.Dv SIGTERM .
.It Fl l Op Ar exit_status
If no operand is given, list the signal names; otherwise, write
the signal name corresponding to
.Ar exit_status .
.It Fl signal_name
A symbolic signal name specifying the signal to be sent instead of the
default
.Dv SIGTERM .
.It Fl signal_number
A non-negative decimal integer specifying the signal to be sent instead
of the default
.Dv SIGTERM .
.El
.Pp
The following PIDs have special meanings:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.It \-1
If super-user, broadcast the signal to all processes; otherwise, broadcast
to all processes belonging to the user.
.El
.Pp
Some of the more commonly used signals:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.It 1
HUP (hang up)
.It 2
INT (interrupt)
.It 3
QUIT (quit)
.It 6
ABRT (abort)
.It 9
KILL (non-catchable, non-ignorable kill)
.It 14
ALRM (alarm clock)
.It 15
TERM (software termination signal)
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility is built-in to
.Xr csh 1 ;
it allows job specifiers of the form
.Dq %...
as arguments
so process IDs are not as often used as
.Nm
arguments.
See
.Xr csh 1
for details.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr csh 1 ,
.Xr ps 1 ,
.Xr kill 2 ,
.Xr sigaction 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is expected to be
.St -p1003.2
compatible.
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
command appeared in
.At v6 .
.Sh BUGS
A replacement for the command
.Dq Li kill 0
for
.Xr csh 1
users should be provided.
