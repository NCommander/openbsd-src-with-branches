.Sh NAME
.Nm systrace
.Nd generates and enforces system call policies
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm systrace
.Op Fl aAituU
.Op Fl d Ar policydir
.Op Fl g Ar gui
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl p Ar pid
.Ar command ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility monitors and controls an application's access to the system by
enforcing access policies for system calls.  The
.Nm
utility might be used to trace an untrusted application's access to
the system.  Alternatively, it might be used to protect the system
from software bugs (such as buffer overflows) by constraining a
daemon's access to the system.
.Pp
The access policy can be generated interactively or obtained from a
policy file.  Operations not covered by the policy raise an alarm and
allow an user to refine the currently configured policy.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Dfxfile
.It Fl a
Enables automatic enforcement of configured policies.
An operation not covered by policy is denied and logged via
.Xr syslog 3 .
.It Fl A
Automatically generate a policy that allows every operation the
application executes.
The created policy functions as a base that can be refined.
.It Fl u
Do not perform aliasing on system call names.  Aliasing is enabled
by default to group similar system calls into a single compound
name.  For example, system calls that read from the file system
like
.Fn lstat
and
.Fn access
are translated to
.Fn fsread .
.It Fl i
Inherits the policy - child processes inherit policy of the parent binary.
.It Fl t
Uses text mode to ask for interactive policy generation.
.It Fl U
Ignore user configured policies and use only global system policies.
.It Fl d Ar policydir
Specifies an alternative location for the user's directory from
which policies are loaded and to which changed policies are stored.
.It Fl g Ar gui
Specifies an alternative location for the notification user interface.
.It Fl f Ar file
The policies specified in
.Ar file
are added to the policies that
.Nm
knows about.
.It Fl p Ar pid
Specifies the pid of a process that
.Nm
should attach to.
The full path name of the corresponding binary has to be specified
as
.Ar command .
.El
.Ss POLICY
The policy is specified via the following grammar:
.Bd -literal -offset AAA
filter = expression "then" action errorcode logcode
expression = symbol | "not" expression | "(" expression ")" |
    expression "and" expression | expression "or" expression
symbol = string typeoff "match" cmdstring |
    string typeoff "eq" cmdstring | string typeoff "neq" cmdstring |
    string typeoff "sub" cmdstring | string typeoff "nsub" cmdstring |
    string typeoff "inpath" cmdstring | "true"
typeoff = /* empty */ | "[" number "]"
action = "permit" | "deny"
errorcode = /* empty */ | "[" string "]"
logcode = /* empty */ | "log"
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Va cmdstring
is an arbitrary string enclosed with quotation marks.
The
.Va errorcode
is used to return an
.Xr errno 2
value to the system call when using a
.Va deny
action.  The values
.Do
inherit
.Dc
and
.Do
detach
.Dc
have special meanings when used with a
.Va permit
rule for the
.Va execve
system call.
When using
.Do
inherit,
.Dc
the current policy is inherited for the new binary.
With
.Do
detach,
.Dc
.Nm
detaches from a process after successfully
completing
the
.Va execve
system call.
.Pp
The filter operations have the following meaning:
.Bl -hang -width Dinpath -offset AAA
.It match
Evaluates to true if file name globbing according to
.Xr fnmatch 3
succeeds.
.It eq
Evaluates to true if the system call argument matches
.Va cmdstring
exactly.
.It neq
This is the logical negation of
.Va eq .
.It sub
Performs a substring match on the system call argument.
.It nsub
This is the logical negation of
.Va sub .
.It inpath
Evaluates to true if the system call argument is a subpath of
.Va cmdstring .
.El
.Pp
By appending the
.Va log
statement to a rule, a matching system call and its arguments
is logged to
.Xr syslog 3 .
This is useful, for example, to log all invocations of the
.Va execve
system call.
.Pp
Policy entries may contain an appended predicate.
Predicates have the following format:
.Bd -literal -offset AAA
", if" {"user", "group"} {"=", "!="} string
.Ed
.Pp
A rule is added to the configured policy only if its predicate
evaluates to true.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width xHOME/xsystrace -compact
.It Pa /dev/systrace
systrace device
.It Pa /etc/systrace
global systrace policies
.It Pa $HOME/.systrace
user specified policies
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
An excerpt from a sample
.Xr ls 1
policy might look as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset AAA
Policy: /bin/ls, Emulation: native
[...]
	native-open: filename eq "$HOME" and oflags sub "ro" then permit
	native-fchdir: permit
[...]
	native-open: filename eq "/tmp" and oflags sub "ro" then permit
	native-stat: permit
	native-open: filename match "$HOME/*" and oflags sub "ro" then permit
	native-open: filename eq "/etc/pwd.db" and oflags sub "ro" then permit
[...]
	native-open: filename eq "/etc" then deny[eperm], if group != wheel

.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
utility was developed by Niels Provos.
.Sh BUGS
Applications that use clone()-like system calls to share the complete
address space between processes may be able to replace system call
arguments after they have been evaluated by
.Nm
and escape policy enforcement.
