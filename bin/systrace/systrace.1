.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility enforces system call policies for applications by
constraining the application's access to the system.
The policy is generated interactively.
Operations not covered by the policy raise an
alarm and allow an user to refine the currently configured policy.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Dfxfile
.It Fl a
Enables automatic enforcement of configured policies.
An operation not covered by policy is denied and logged via
.Xr syslog 3 .
.It Fl A
Automatically generate a policy that allows every operation the
application executes.
The created policy functions as a base that can be refined.
.It Fl i
Inherits the policy of the first executed binary to all children.
.It Fl t
Uses text mode to ask for interactive policy generation.
.It Fl U
Ignore user configured policies and use only global system policies.
.It Fl g Ar gui
Specifies an alternative location for the notification user interface.
.It Fl f Ar file
The policies specified in
.Ar file
are added to the policies that
.Nm
knows about.
