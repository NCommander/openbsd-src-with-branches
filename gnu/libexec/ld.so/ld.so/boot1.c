/* Program to load an ELF binary on a linux system, and run it.
 * References to symbols in sharable libraries can be resolved by
 * an ELF sharable library. */

/* Disclaimer:  I have never seen any AT&T source code for SVr4, nor have
   I ever taken any courses on internals.  This program was developed using
   information available through the book "UNIX SYSTEM V RELEASE 4,
   Programmers guide: Ansi C and Programming Support Tools", which did
   a more than adequate job of explaining everything required to get this
   working. */

/*
 * The main trick with this program is that initially, we ourselves are not
 * dynamicly linked.  This means that we cannot access any global variables
 * since the GOT is initialized by the linker assuming a virtual address of 0,
 * and we cannot call any functions since the PLT is not initialized at all
 * (it will tend to want to call the dynamic linker
 *
 * There are further restrictions - we cannot use large switch statements,
 * since the compiler generates tables of addresses and jumps through them.
 * We can use inline functions, because these do not transfer control to
 * a new address, but they must be static so that they are not exported
 * from the modules.  We cannot use normal syscall stubs, because these
 * all reference the errno global variable which is not yet initialized.
 * We can use all of the local stack variables that we want, since these
 * are all referenced to %ebp or %esp.
 *
 * Life is further complicated by the fact that initially we do not want
 * to do a complete dynamic linking.  We want to allow the user to supply
 * new functions replacing some of the library versions, and until we have
 * the list of modules that we should search set up, we do not want to do
 * any of this.  Thus I have chosen to only perform the relocations for
 * variables that start with "_dl_" since ANSI specifies that the user is
 * not supposed to redefine any of these variables.
 *
 * Fortunately, the linker itself leaves a few clues lying around, and
 * when the kernel starts the image, there are a few further clues.
 * First of all, there is information buried on the stack that the kernel
 * leaves, which includes information about the load address that the
 * program interpreter was loaded at, the number of sections, the address
 * the application was loaded at and so forth.  Here this information
 * is stored in the array dl_info, and the indicies are taken from the
 * file /usr/include/sys/auxv.h on any SVr4 system.
 *
 * The linker itself leaves a pointer to the .dynamic section in the first
 * slot of the GOT, and as it turns out, %ebx points to ghe GOT when
 * you are using PIC code, so we just dereference this to get the address
 * of the dynamic sections.
 *
 * Typically you must load all text pages as writable so that dynamic linking
 * can succeed.  The kernel under SVr4 loads these as R/O, so we must call
 * mprotect to change the protections.  Once we are done, we should set these
 * back again, so the desired behavior is achieved.  Under linux there is
 * currently no mprotect function in the distribution kernel (although
 * someone has alpha patches), so for now everything is loaded writable.
 *
 * We do not have access to malloc and friends at the initial stages of dynamic
 * linking, and it would be handy to have some scratchpad memory available
 * for use as we set things up.  It is a bit of a kluge, but we mmap /dev/zero
 * to get one page of scratchpad.  A simpleminded _dl_malloc is provided so
 * that we have some memory that can be used for this purpose.  Typically
 * we would not want to use the same memory pool as malloc anyway - the user
 * might want to redefine malloc for example.
 *
 * Our first task is to perform a minimal linking so that we can call other
 * portions of the dynamic linker.  Once we have done this, we then build
 * the list of modules that the application requires, using LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 * if this is not a suid program (/usr/lib otherwise).  Once this is done,
 * we can do the dynamic linking as required (and we must omit the things
 * we did to get the dynamic linker up and running in the first place.
 * After we have done this, we just have a few housekeeping chores and we
 * can transfer control to the user's application.
