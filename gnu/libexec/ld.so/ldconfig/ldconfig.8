.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ldconfig
creates the necessary links and cache (for use by the run-time linker,
.IR ld.so )
to the most recent shared libraries found in the directories specified
on the command line, in the file
.IR /etc/ld.so.conf ,
and in the trusted directory
.RI ( /usr/lib ).
.I ldconfig
checks the header and file names of the DLL's it encounters when
determining which versions should have their links updated.
.PP
.I ldconfig
should normally be run by the super-user as it may require write 
permission on some root owned directories and files.
It is normally run automatically at bootup, from /etc/rc, or manually
whenever new DLL's are installed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-D
Debug mode.
Implies
.B \-N
and
.BR \-X .
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode.
Print current version number, the name of each directory as it
is scanned and any links that are created.
.TP
.B \-n
Only process directories specified on the command line.
Don't process the trusted directories
.RI ( /usr/lib
and
.IR /lib )
nor those specified in
.IR /etc/ld.so.conf .
Implies
.BR \-N .
.TP
.B \-N
Don't rebuild the cache.
Unless
.B \-X
is also specified, links are still updated.
.TP
.B \-X
Don't update links.
Unless
.B \-N
is also specified, the cache is still rebuilt.
.TP
.B \-m
Merge specified directories into the cache, processes the same files as
.B \-n
although it does not imply
.B \-N
.  This option exists
mainly for compatibility with the a.out variant of
.IR ldconfig .
.TP
.B \-l
Library mode.
Manually link individual libraries.
Intended for use by experts only.
.TP
.B \-p
Print the lists of directories and candidate libraries stored in
the current cache.
.SH EXAMPLES
In the bootup file
.I /etc/rc
having the line
.RS

/sbin/ldconfig -v

.RE
will set up the correct links for the shared binaries and rebuild
the cache.
.TP
On the command line
.RS

# /sbin/ldconfig -n /lib

.RE
as root after the installation of a new DLL, will properly update the
shared library symbolic links in /lib.

.SH BUGS
.LP
.BR ldconfig ,
is a temporary solution that lacks much. It will eventually be replaced.
.PP
.BR ldconfig ,
being a user process, must be run manually and has no means of dynamically
determining and relinking shared libraries for use by
.BR ld.so
when a new DLL is installed.
