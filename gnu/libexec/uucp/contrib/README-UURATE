See the man page for documentation.

Installation:
------------

(1) Copy or sym-link Makefile.uurt to Makefile.

(2) Edit Makefile: set BIN where you want uurate to be installed,
    MAN where the man page should go to, and set CFLAGS to point
    to the directory containing the UUCP sources (this is .. by
    default). Don't forget to set newconfigdir= to point to the
    directory where the (Taylor-uucp)config is stored.

(3) Type ``make'' to compile the program.

(4) Type ``make install'' to install the program.
