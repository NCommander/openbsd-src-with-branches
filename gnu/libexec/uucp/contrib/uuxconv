#
# After converting to Taylor from SVR4.03 UUCP, I still had a lot of
# jobs queued up to go out.
#
# This script is a one-shot to mass-requeue a site's spool.
#
# It doesn't go and do your whole spool, nor even all grades.
# you need to go into each grade directory for each site and 
# execute this.
#
# i.e.:  You have a site named 'foo'
# cd /var/spool/uucp/foo/Z
# uuxconv foo
# 
# it does delete the 'D' & 'X' after requeing them, but doesn't remove
# the 'C' files.
#
# I foolishly went and ran this script on all my queued jobs, without
# adding the improvements to recursively go through the entire UUCP spool,
# so now I'm out of files to test with.  I don't want to add the code
# to do that since I can't test it, and this worked.
#
# I hereby give this (trivial :-)) program to the GNU Project/FSF
# and Ian Taylor in it's entirety, so that it can be placed in
# the contrib directory of taylor-uucp, and save others the pain
# of rewriting it.
