   between a value that is not set and a value that has been set to
   NULL.  We do this by initializing the value to point to the
   variable _uuconf_unset, and then correcting it in the function
   _uuconf_isystem_basic_default.  This variable is declared in this

   file which merely declarates a variable.  This functions happens to
   be pulled in by almost everything.  */

   array of elements ending in NULL.  The total number of available
   slots is always a multiple of CSLOTS, so by counting the current
   number of elements we can tell whether a new slot is needed.  If
   the fcopy argument is TRUE, the new string is duplicated into
   memory.  If the fcheck argument is TRUE, this does not add a string
   that is already in the list.  The pblock argument may be used to do
   the allocations within a memory block.  This returns a standard
   uuconf error code.  */
