/* Split a string into tokens.  The bsep argument is the separator to
   use.  If it is the null byte, white space is used as the separator,
   and leading white space is discarded.  Otherwise, each occurrence
   of the separator character delimits a field (and thus some fields
   may be empty).  The array and size arguments may be used to reuse
   the same memory.  This function is not tied to uuconf; the only way
   it can fail is if malloc or realloc fails.  */
