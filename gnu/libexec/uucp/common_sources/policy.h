   file descriptor has been set to not block.  File transfer can be
   more efficient if the package knows that a write to the serial port
   will not block; however, if the write does block unexpectedly then
   data loss is possible at high speeds.

   If writes to a serial port always block even when requested not to,
   you should set HAVE_UNBLOCKED_WRITES to 0; otherwise you should set
   it to 1.  In general on System V releases without STREAMS-based

   see an unexpectedly large number of transmission errors, or, if you
   have hardware handshaking, transfer times may be lower than
   expected (but then, they always are).  If HAVE_UNBLOCKED_WRITES is

   usually 64.  On SVR4, which uses STREAMS-based ttys, 2048 is
   reasonable.  Define SINGLE_WRITE to the correct value for your

/* You must also specify the format of the lock files by setting
   exactly one of the following macros to 1.  Check an existing lock
   file to decide which of these choices is more appropriate.

   The HDB style is to write the locking process ID in ASCII, passed
   to ten characters, followed by a newline.

   The V2 style is to write the locking process ID as four binary
   bytes in the host byte order.  Many BSD derived systems use this
   type of lock file, including the NeXT.

   SCO lock files are similar to HDB lock files, but always lock the
   lowercase version of the tty (i.e., LCK..tty2a is created if you
   are locking tty2A).  They are appropriate if you are using Taylor
   UUCP on an SCO Unix, SCO Xenix, or SCO Open Desktop system.

   SVR4 lock files are also similar to HDB lock files, but they use a
   different naming convention.  The filenames are LK.xxx.yyy.zzz,
   where xxx is the major device number of the device holding the
   special device file, yyy is the major device number of the port
   device itself, and zzz is the minor device number of the port
   device.

   Sequent DYNIX/ptx (but perhaps not Dynix 3.x) uses yet another
   naming convention.  The lock file for /dev/ttyXA/XAAP is named
   LCK..ttyXAAP.

   Coherent use a completely different method of terminal locking.
   See unix/cohtty for details.  For locks other than for terminals,
   HDB type lock files are used.

   QNX lock files are similar to HDB lock files except that the node
   ID must be stored in addition to the process ID and for serial
   devices the node ID must be included in the lock file name.  QNX
   boxes are generally used in bunches, and all of them behave like
   one big machine to some extent.  Thus, processes on different
   machines will be sharing the files in the spool directory.  To
   detect if a process has died and a lock is thus stale, you need the
   node ID of the process as well as the process ID.  The process ID
   is stored as a number written using ASCII digits padded to 10
   characters, followed by a space, followed by the node ID written
   using ASCII digits padded to 10 characters, followed by a newline.
   The format for QNX lock files was made up just for Taylor UUCP.
