<h1 align="center">Downloading GCC</h1>

<p>GCC is distributed via FTP tarballs compressed with gzip or bzip2.  It is
possible to download a full distribution or specific components.

<p>The full distribution includes the C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java,
and Chill compilers.  The full distribution also includes runtime libraries
for C++, Objective-C and Fortran.  In the future the GNU compiler testsuites
will be included in the full distribution.

<p>If you choose to download specific components, you must download the core
gcc distribution plus any language specific distributions you wish to
use.  The core distribution includes the C language front-end as well as the
shared componenets. Each language has a tarball which includes the language
front-end as well as the language runtime (when appropriate).

<p>Unpack the core distribution as well as any language specific distributions
in the same directory.
