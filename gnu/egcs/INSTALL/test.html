<h1 align="center">Installation Instructions: Testing GCC</h1>

<p>The testsuite has been temporarily removed from the gcc distributions
until the copyright status of some tests can be determined.  It is hoped
that the testsuite will be included in the gcc releases again soon.

<p>Until the testsuite is included it is impossible to run the testsuite.
Sorry.
