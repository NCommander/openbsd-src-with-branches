                   Installation Instructions: Testing GCC
                                      
   The testsuite has been temporarily removed from the gcc distributions
   until the copyright status of some tests can be determined. It is
   hoped that the testsuite will be included in the gcc releases again
   soon.
   
   Until the testsuite is included it is impossible to run the testsuite.
   Sorry.
