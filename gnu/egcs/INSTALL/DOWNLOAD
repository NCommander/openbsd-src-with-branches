   GCC is distributed via FTP tarballs compressed with gzip or bzip2. It
   is possible to download a full distribution or specific components.
   
   The full distribution includes the C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java,
   and Chill compilers. The full distribution also includes runtime
   libraries for C++, Objective-C and Fortran. In the future the GNU
   compiler testsuites will be included in the full distribution.
   
   If you choose to download specific components, you must download the
   core gcc distribution plus any language specific distributions you
   wish to use. The core distribution includes the C language front-end
   as well as the shared componenets. Each language has a tarball which
   includes the language front-end as well as the language runtime (when
   appropriate).
   
   Unpack the core distribution as well as any language specific
   distributions in the same directory.
