libnet 1.27  -- Fri May 30 2014

  * Simplified Makefile.PL requirements.

libnet 1.26  -- Fri May 30 2014

  * Set minimum required ExtUtils::MakeMaker version to 6.64 to ensure that all
    parameters used are supported, to save jumping through hoops to support
    earlier versions.  (This should not be a problem since ExtUtils::MakeMaker
    6.64 is easily installed into Perl 5.8.1 and above, that being the whole
    point of the new choice of minimum supported Perl version.)
  * Set minimum required Perl version to 5.8.1.  This is in line with the
    minimum requirement of the "Perl Toolchain".
