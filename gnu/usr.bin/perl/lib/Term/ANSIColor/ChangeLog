	* ANSIColor.pm: Version 1.04 released.

	* ANSIColor.pm: Add documentation, examples, and diagnostics for
	uncolor.  Document ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED.  Add information about
	the relevant standards for these escape sequences and the
	additional ones that aren't supported by this module.  Add a
	pointer to the relevant standards.  Add a LICENSE section.  Update
	Zenin's e-mail address.

	* ANSIColor.pm (AUTOLOAD): Add support for ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED.
	(color): Likewise.
	(colored): Likewise.
	* test.pl: Add tests for ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED.

	* ANSIColor.pm (uncolor): New function.
	* test.pl: Add a test for it.

2000-08-06  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* ANSIColor.pm: Version 1.03 released.

	* Makefile.PL: Install in the Perl library directory for Perl
	versions >= 5.6.0.

	* test.pl: Added a new test for the array reference syntax for
	colored.

	* ANSIColor.pm: Changed $VERSION to a static string.  Added dark
	to the attributes.  Updated the documentation to include a table
	of supported attributes on different terminal emulators, to add
	dark, to document the new optional way to call colored, and to
	mark the diagnostics as fatal errors or warnings.
	(colored): Allow the attributes to be passed as an initial array
	reference as well as a final list, and for that calling syntax
	take the rest of the arguments as text to be colored.

1998-11-27  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* ANSIColor.pm: Version 1.02 released.

	* Makefile.PL: Added a 5.005-only section giving ABSTRACT and
	AUTHOR settings for generating a PPD to go with a binary
	distribution or the Perl Resource Kits.

1998-04-14  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* ANSIColor.pm: croak() instead of die() on AUTOLOAD failure to
	get the right error text, fixed a bunch of typos in the
	documentation, added a quote.

1997-12-10  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* ANSIColor.pm: Version 1.01 released.

	* ANSIColor.pm (color): Carp::croak() isn't predeclared, so it
	needs parens around its argument.  This bug will only show up in
	versions of Perl >5.004_04 since up until then strict.pm imports
	Carp which predeclares the function.

1997-11-29  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* ANSIColor.pm: Version 1.00 released.

	* Makefile.PL: Now gets version information from the module, has
	the correct rules to build a distribution.

	* test.pl: Comments trimmed, minor test modifications.

	* ANSIColor.pm: Changed my e-mail address, fixed to deal correctly
	with trailing delimiters when EACHLINE is being used, die()
	changed to croak() if the caller uses an invalid attribute name,
	getting $VERSION from RCS updated to my current method, source
	detabified.

	* test.pl: Added test for EACHLINE with trailing delimiters.

1997-02-17  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* ANSIColor.pm: Version 0.9 released.

	* ANSIColor.pm: Changed the runtime error message to start with an
	uppercase letter, reworked the documentation considerably
	including adding more comparison between the two interfaces,
	fixing some formatting bugs, fixing a typo, adding more
	diagnostics, and generally being more verbose.

1997-01-08  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* ANSIColor.pm: Version 0.8 released.

	* test.pl: Fixed the test numbering in the BEGIN block.

	* test.pl: Reformatted and commented to fit my programming style.

	* ANSIColor.pm: Changed the method by which $VERSION is set so
	that it will always have two digits after the decimal point.

	* test.pl: New file.

	* ANSIColor.pm: [Revision 0.7] Changed the codes so that reset is
	always consistantly "\e[0m".

	* ANSIColor.pm: [Revision 0.6] Added $EACHLINE and support to
	colored() for it so that attributes can be reset around every
	newline (or other line delimiter -- we're flexible).  Documented
	this as well.

	* ANSIColor.pm: [Revision 0.5] Changed implementation of the
	constants to autoloaded subs, added the $AUTORESET variable for
	use with the constants, and documented this.

1996-12-07  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* ANSIColor.pm: [Revision 0.4] Added POD documentation.

	* ANSIColor.pm: [Revision 0.3] Added constant forms, modified to
	allow a space-separated string of attributes to be passed to
	color() and colored(), added Zenin to the credits.

1996-12-04  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* ANSIColor.pm: [Revision 0.2] Changed return syntax and check for
	the null attribute string.

	* ANSIColor.pm: New file.
