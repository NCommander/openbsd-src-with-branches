2003-06-21  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* Release 1.06:  Now has "use utf8" to make the things work
	happily.  Some fancy footwork is required to make this work under
	pre-utf8 perl versions.
	
2003-04-18  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* Release 1.05:  Different Makefile.PL, same .pm code.
	
	Jesse Vincent, Hugo van der Sanden, and Jarkko Hietaniemi
	encourage me to add this to the makefile:
	 ($] < 5.008) ? () : ( INSTALLDIRS => 'perl'),
	so that when you install this on a recent version of perl (5.8 or
	later), the installation will overwrite the Maketext.pm in your
	core library directory.  Email me if this produces trouble for any
	of you folks out there, okay?
	
2003-04-02  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* Release 1.04: Implementing proper HTTP "tag;q=rank" parsing for
	get_handle.  This should make all the difference for users/victims
	of the current version of Safari, which uses that syntax as well
	as inserts random languages with low q numbers.
	Thanks to Jesse Vincent and the whole RT junta for finding this.

	* Added more tests, now in t/

	* Lots of typo fixes to Maketext.pm.  Thanks to Evan A. Zacks for
	patient help in finding them all.	
	
2001-06-21  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* Release 1.03: basically cosmetic tweaks to the docs and the
	test.pl.
	
2001-06-20  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* Release 1.02:  EBCDIC-compatability changes courtesy of Peter
	Prymmer.  Added [*,...] as alias for [quant,...] and [#,...] as an
	alias for [numf,...].  Added some more things to test.pl
	
2001-05-25  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* Release 1.01:  total rewrite.  Docs are massive now.
	Including TPJ13 article now.
	
2000-05-14  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org

	* Release 0.18:  only change, regrettably, is a better makefile,
	and it my email address has changed.

1999-03-15  Sean M. Burke  sburke@netadventure.net
