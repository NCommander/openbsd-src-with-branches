Unicode/Collate version 0.33
===============================

NAME

  Unicode::Collate - Unicode Collation Algorithm

SYNOPSIS

  use Unicode::Collate;

  #construct
  $Collator = Unicode::Collate->new(%tailoring);

  #sort
  @sorted = $Collator->sort(@not_sorted);

  #compare
  $result = $Collator->cmp($a, $b); # returns 1, 0, or -1.
  $result = $Collator->eq($a, $b);  # returns true/false
    (similarly ->ne, ->lt, ->le, ->gt, ->ge)

INSTALLATION

Perl 5.6.1 or later
(recommended: Perl 5.8.0 or later)

To use this module, it is recommended to install a table file
in the UCA format, by copying it into the directory
where F<Unicode/Collate.pm> is installed;
e.g. into F<perl/lib/Unicode/Collate/> directory
if you have F<perl/lib/Unicode/Collate.pm>.

The most preferable one is "The Default Unicode Collation Element Table",
available from the Unicode consortium's website:

  http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/latest/allkeys.txt (latest version)

Though this distribution contains a subset of allkeys.txt, named "keys.txt",
this one is intended only for doing a test of this module
and practically useless for any other purpose.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

(!! XSUB for Unicode::Collate is an EXPERIMENTAL support !!)
If you have a C compiler and want to use XSUB edition,
type the following (!! "enableXS" must run before "Makefile.PL" !!):

   perl enableXS
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you decide to install pure Perl (i.e. non-XS) edition after trying
to build XSUB, type the following:

   make clean
   perl disableXS
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

  The conformant collation requires Unicode::Normalize (v 0.10 or later)
  although Unicode::Collate can be used without Unicode::Normalize.
