Unicode/Collate version 0.12
===============================

Unicode::Collate - Unicode Collation Algorithm

  UCA - Unicode TR #10.
  http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr10/

  Fetch the following file and put it into the Unicode/Collate directory.
  http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr10/allkeys.txt

  You can install this module using a subset "keys.txt"
  contained in this distribution without the "allkeys.txt";
  but "keys.txt" is small and not very useful.

SYNOPSIS

  use Unicode::Collate;

  #construct
  $Collator = Unicode::Collate->new(%tailoring);

  #sort
  @sorted = $Collator->sort(@not_sorted);

  #compare
  $result = $Collator->cmp($a, $b); # returns 1, 0, or -1.
  $result = $Collator->eq($a, $b);  # returns true/false
    (similarly ->ne, ->lt, ->le, ->gt, ->ge)

INSTALLATION

Perl 5.006 or later

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

  It's better if you have Unicode::Normalize (v 0.10 or later)
  although Unicode::Collate can be used without Unicode::Normalize.
