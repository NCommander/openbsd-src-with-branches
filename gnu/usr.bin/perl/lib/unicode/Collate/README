Unicode/Collate version 0.30
===============================

NAME

  Unicode::Collate - Unicode Collation Algorithm

SYNOPSIS

  use Unicode::Collate;

  #construct
  $Collator = Unicode::Collate->new(%tailoring);

  #sort
  @sorted = $Collator->sort(@not_sorted);

  #compare
  $result = $Collator->cmp($a, $b); # returns 1, 0, or -1.
  $result = $Collator->eq($a, $b);  # returns true/false
    (similarly ->ne, ->lt, ->le, ->gt, ->ge)

INSTALLATION

Perl 5.6.1 or later

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

To use this module, it is better to install a table file in the UCA format,
by copying it into the lib/Unicode/Collate directory.

The most preferable one is "The Default Unicode Collation Element Table",
available from the Unicode consortium's website:

    http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/allkeys.txt

Though this distribution contains a subset of allkeys.txt, named "keys.txt",
this one is intended only for doing a test of this module
and practically useless for any other purpose.

DEPENDENCIES

  The conformant collation requires Unicode::Normalize (v 0.10 or later)
  although Unicode::Collate can be used without Unicode::Normalize.
