Revision history for Perl extension Unicode::Collate.

0.12  Sun May 05 09:43:10 2002
    - add new methods, ->UCA_Version and ->Base_Unicode_Version.
    - test fix: removed the needless requirement of Unicode::Normalize.
      [reported by David Hand]

0.11  Fri May 03 02:28:10 2002
    - fix: now derived collation elements can be used for Hangul Jamo
      when their weights are not defined.
      [reported by Andreas J. Koenig]
    - fix: rearrangements had not worked.
    - mentioned pleblem on index() in BUGS.
    - more documents, more tests.
    - tag names for 'alternate' are case-insensitive (i.e. 'SHIFTed' etc.).
    - The <undef> value for the keys "overrideCJK", "overrideHangul",
      "rearrange" has a special behavior (different from default).

0.10  Tue Dec 11 23:26:42 2001
    - now you are allowed to use no table file.
    - fix: fetching CE with two or more combining characters.

0.09  Sun Nov 11 17:02:40:18 2001
    - add the following methods: eq, ne, lt, le, gt, le.
    - relies on &Unicode::Normalize::getCombinClass()
      in place of %Unicode::Normalize::Combin
      (the hash is not defined in the XS version of Unicode::Normalize).
      then you should install Unicode::Normalize 0.10 or later.
    - now independent of Lingua::KO::Hangul::Util
      (this module does decomposition of Hangul syllables for itself)
