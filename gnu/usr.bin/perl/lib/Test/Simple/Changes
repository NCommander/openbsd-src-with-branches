Revision history for Perl extension Test::Simple

0.47  Mon Aug 26 03:54:22 PDT 2002 
    * Tatsuhiko Miyagawa noticed Test::Builder was accidentally storing 
      objects passed into test functions causing problems with tests 
      relying on object destruction.
    - Added example of calculating the number of tests to Test::Tutorial
    - Peter Scott made the ending logic not fire on child processes when
      forking.
    * Test::Builder is once again ithread safe.

0.46  Sat Jul 20 19:57:40 EDT 2002
    - Noted eq_set() isn't really a set comparision.
    - Test fix, exit codes are broken on MacPerl (bleadperl@16868)
    - Make Test::Simple install itself into the core for >= 5.8
    - Small fixes to Test::Tutorial and skip examples
    * Added TB->has_plan() from Adrian Howard
    - Clarified the meaning of 'actual_ok' from TB->details
    * Added TB->details() from chromatic
    - Neil Watkiss fixed a pre-5.8 test glitch with threads.t
    * If the test died before a plan, it would exit with 0 [ID 20020716.013]

0.45  Wed Jun 19 18:41:12 EDT 2002
    - Andy Lester made the SKIP & TODO docs a bit clearer.
    - Explicitly disallowing double plans. (RT #553)
    - Kicking up the minimum version of Test::Harness to one that's
      fairly bug free.
    - Made clear a common problem with use_ok and BEGIN blocks.
    - Arthur Bergman made Test::Builder thread-safe.

0.44  Thu Apr 25 00:27:27 EDT 2002
    - names containing newlines no longer produce confusing output
      (from chromatic)
    - chromatic provided a fix so can_ok() honors can() overrides.
    - Nick Ing-Simmons suggested todo_skip() be a bit clearer about
      the skipping part.
    - Making plan() vomit if it gets something it doesn't understand.
    - Tatsuhiko Miyagawa fixed use_ok() with pragmata on older perls.
    - quieting diag(undef)

0.43  Thu Apr 11 22:55:23 EDT 2002
    - Adrian Howard added TB->maybe_regex()
    - Adding Mark Fowler's suggestion to make diag() return
      false.
    - TB->current_test() still not working when no tests were run via
      TB itself.  Fixed by Dave Rolsky.

0.42  Wed Mar  6 15:00:24 EST 2002
    - Setting Test::Builder->current_test() now works (see what happens
      when you forget to test things?)
    - The change in is()'s undef/'' handling in 0.34 was an API change, 
      but I forgot to declare it as such.
    - The apostrophilic jihad attacks!  Philip Newtons patch for
      grammar mistakes in the doc's.

0.41  Mon Dec 17 22:45:20 EST 2001
    * chromatic added diag()
    - Internal eval()'s sometimes interfering with $@ and $!.  Fixed.

0.40  Fri Dec 14 15:41:39 EST 2001
    * isa_ok() now accepts unblessed references gracefully
    - Nick Clark found a bug with like() and a regex with % in it.
    - exit.t was hanging on 5.005_03 VMS perl.  Test now skipped.
    - can_ok() would pass if no methods were given.  Now fails.
    - isnt() diagnostic output format changed
    * Added some docs about embedding and extending Test::More
    * Added Test::More->builder
    * Added cmp_ok()
    * Added todo_skip()
    * Added unlike()
    - Piers pointed out that sometimes people override isa().
      isa_ok() now accounts for that.

0.36  Thu Nov 29 14:07:39 EST 2001
    - Matthias Urlichs found that intermixed prints to STDOUT and test 
      output came out in the wrong order when piped.

0.35  Tue Nov 27 19:57:03 EST 2001
    - Little glitch in the test suite.  No actual bug.

0.34  Tue Nov 27 15:43:56 EST 2001
    * **API CHANGE** Empty string no longer matches undef in is() 
      and isnt().
    * Added isnt_eq and isnt_num to Test::Builder.

0.33  Mon Oct 22 21:05:47 EDT 2001
    * It's now officially safe to redirect STDOUT and STDERR without
      affecting test output.
    - License and POD cleanup by Autrijus Tang
    - Synched up Test::Tutorial with the wiki version
    - Minor VMS test nit.

0.32  Tue Oct 16 16:52:02 EDT 2001
    * Finally added a seperate plan() function
    * Adding a name field to isa_ok()
      (Requested by Dave Rolsky)
    - Test::More was using Carp.pm, causing the occasional false positive.
      (Reported by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa)

0.31  Mon Oct  8 19:24:53 EDT 2001
    * Added an import option to Test::More
    * Added no_ending and no_header options to Test::Builder
      (Thanks to Dave Rolsky for giving this a swift kick in the ass)
    * Added is_deeply().  Display of scalar refs not quite 100%
      (Thanks to Stas Bekman for Apache::TestUtil idea thievery)
    - Fixed a minor warning with skip()
      (Thanks to Wolfgang Weisselberg for finding this one)

0.30  Thu Sep 27 22:10:04 EDT 2001
    * Added Test::Builder
      (Thanks muchly to chromatic for getting this off the ground!)
    * Diagnostics are back to using STDERR *unless* it's from a todo
      test.  Those go to STDOUT.
    - Fixed it so nothing is printed if a test is run with a -c flag.
      Handy when a test is being deparsed with B::Deparse.

0.20  *UNRELEASED*

0.19  Tue Sep 18 17:48:32 EDT 2001
    * Test::Simple and Test::More no longer print their diagnostics
      to STDERR.  It instead goes to STDOUT.
    * TODO tests which fail now print full failure diagnostics.
    - Minor bug in ok()'s test name diagnostics made it think a blank
      name was a number.
    - ok() less draconian about test names
    - Added temporary special case for Parrot::Test
    - Now requiring File::Spec for our tests.

0.18  Wed Sep  5 20:35:24 EDT 2001
    * ***API CHANGE*** can_ok() only counts as one test
    - can_ok() has better diagnostics
    - Minor POD fixes from mjd
    - adjusting the internal layout to make it easier to put it into
      the core

0.17  Wed Aug 29 20:16:28 EDT 2001
    * Added can_ok() and isa_ok() to Test::More

0.16  Tue Aug 28 19:52:11 EDT 2001
    * vmsperl foiled my sensisble exit codes.  Reverting to a much more
      coarse scheme.

      (Thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa)

0.11  Sat Aug 11 23:05:19 EDT 2001

    - exit codes tested
    * exit code on abnormal exit changed to 255 (thanks to Tim Bunce for
      pointing out that Unix can't do negative exit codes)
    - abnormal exits now better caught.
    - No longer using Test.pm to test this, but still minimum of 5.005
      due to needing $^S.
