Revision history for Perl extension Test::Harness

2.26  Wed Jun 19 16:58:02 EDT 2002
    - Workaround for MacPerl's lack of a working putenv.  It will never 
      see the PERL5LIB environment variable (perl@16942).

2.25  Sun Jun 16 03:00:33 EDT 2002
    - $Strap is now a global to allow Test::Harness::Straps
      experimentation.
    - Little spelling nit in a diagnostic.
    - Chris Richmond noted that the runtests() docs were wrong.  It will
      die, not return false, when any tests fail.  This is silly, but
      historically necessary for 'make test'.  Docs corrected.
    - MacPerl test fixes from Pudge. (mutation of bleadperl@16989)
    - Undef warning introduced in 2.24 on skipped tests with no reasons 
      fixed.
    * Test::Harness now depends on File::Spec

2.24  Wed May 29 19:02:18 EDT 2002
    * Nikola Knezevic found a bug when tests are completely skipped
      but no reason is given it was considered a failure.
    * Made Test::Harness::Straps->analyze_file & Test::Harness a bit
      more graceful when the test doesn't exist.

2.23  Wed May 22 12:59:47 EDT 2002
    - reason for all skip wasn't being displayed.  Broken in 2.20.
    - Changed the wait status tests to conform with POSIX standards.
    - Quieted some SYSTEM$ABORT noise leaking out from dying test tests
      on VMS.

2.22  Fri May 17 19:01:35 EDT 2002
    - Fixed parsing of #!/usr/bin/perl-current to not see a -t.
      (RT #574)
    - Fixed exit codes on MPE/iX

2.21  Mon May  6 00:43:22 EDT 2002
    - removed a bunch of dead code left over after 2.20's gutting.
    - The fix for the $^X "bug" added in 2.02 has been removed.  It
      caused more trouble than the old bug (I'd never seen a problem
      before anyway)
    - 2.20 broke $verbose

2.20  Sat May  4 22:31:20 EDT 2002
    * An almost complete conversion of the Test::Harness test parsing
      to use Test::Harness::Straps.

2.04  Tue Apr 30 00:54:49 EDT 2002
    * Changing the output format of skips
    - Taking into account VMS's special exit codes in the tests.

2.03  Thu Apr 25 01:01:34 EDT 2002
    * $^X fix made safer.
    - Noise from loading wait.ph to analyze core files supressed
    - MJD found a situation where a test could run Test::Harness
      out of memory.  Protecting against that specific case.
    - Made the 1..M docs a bit clearer.
    - Fixed TODO tests so Test::Harness does not display a NOK for
      them.
    - Test::Harness::Straps->analyze_file() docs were not clear as to
      its effects

2.02  Thu Mar 14 18:06:04 EST 2002
    * Ken Williams fixed the long standing $^X bug.
    * Added HARNESS_VERBOSE
    * Fixed a bug where Test::Harness::Straps was considering a test that 
      is ok but died as passing.
    - Added the exit and wait codes of the test to the 
      analyze_file() results.

2.01  Thu Dec 27 18:54:36 EST 2001
    * Added 'passing' to the results to tell you if the test passed
    * Added Test::Harness::Straps example (examples/mini_harness.plx)
    * Header-at-end tests were being interpreted as failing sometimes
    - The 'skip_all' results from analyze* was not being set
    - analyze_fh() and analyze_file() now work more efficiently, reading
      line-by-line instead of slurping as before.

2.00  Sun Dec 23 19:13:57 EST 2001
    - Fixed a warning on VMS.
    - Removed a little unnecessary code from analyze_file()
    - Made sure filehandles are getting closed
    - analyze() now considers "not \nok" to be a failure (VMSism)
      but Test::Harness still doesn't.

2.00_05 Mon Dec 17 22:08:02 EST 2001
    * Wasn't filtering @INC properly when a test is run with -T, caused the 
      command line to be too long on VMS.  VMS should be 100% now.
    - Little bug in the skip 'various reasons' logic.
    - Minor POD nit in 5.004_04
    - Little speling mistak

2.00_04 Sun Dec 16 00:33:32 EST 2001
    * Major Test::Harness::Straps doc bug.

2.00_03 Sat Dec 15 23:52:17 EST 2001
    * First release candidate
    * 'summary' is now 'details'
    * Test #1 is now element 0 on the details array.  It works out better
      that way.
    * analyze_file() is more portable, but no longer taint clean
    * analyze_file() properly preserves @INC and handles -T switches
    - minor mistake in the test header line parsing

1.26  Mon Nov 12 15:44:01 EST 2001
    * An excuse to upload a new version to CPAN to get Test::Harness
      back on the index.

2.00_00  Sat Sep 29 00:12:03 EDT 2001
    * Partial gutting of the internals
    * Added Test::Harness::Straps

1.25  Tue Aug  7 08:51:09 EDT 2001
    * Fixed a bug with tests failing if they're all skipped
      reported by Stas Bekman.
    - Fixed a very minor warning in 5.004_04
    - Fixed displaying filenames not from @ARGV
    - Merging with bleadperl
    -  minor fixes to the filename in the report
    -  '[no reason given]' skip reason

1.24  Tue Aug  7 08:51:09 EDT 2001
    - Added internal information about number of todo tests

1.23  Tue Jul 31 15:06:47 EDT 2001
    - Merged in Ilya's "various reasons" patch
    * Fixed "not ok 23 - some name # TODO" style tests

1.22  Mon Jun 25 02:00:02 EDT 2001
    * Fixed bug with failing tests using header at end.
    - Documented how Test::Harness deals with garbage input
    - Turned on test counter mismatch warning

1.21  Wed May 23 19:22:53 BST 2001
    * No longer considered unstable.  Merging back with the perl core.
    - Fixed minor nit about the report summary
    - Added docs on the meaning of the failure report
    - Minor POD nits fixed mirroring perl change 9176
    - TODO and SEE ALSO expanded

1.20  Wed Mar 14 23:09:20 GMT 2001 by Michael G Schwern    *UNSTABLE*
    * Fixed and tested with 5.004!
    - Added EXAMPLE docs
    - Added TODO docs
    - Now uneffected by -l, $\ or $,

1.19  Sat Mar 10 00:43:29 GMT 2001 by Michael G Schwern    *UNSTABLE*
    - More internal reworking
    * Removed use of experimental /(?>...)/ feature for backwards compat
    * Removed use of open(my $fh, $file) for backwards compatibility
    * Removed use of Tie::StdHandle in tests for backwards compat
    * Added dire warning that this is unstable.
    - Added some tests from the old CPAN release

1.18  Mon Mar  5 17:35:11 GMT 2001 by Michael G Schwern
    * Under new management!
    * Test::Harness is now being concurrently shipped on CPAN as well
      as in the core.
    - Switched "our" for "use vars" and moved the minimum version back
      to 5.004.  This may be optimistic.


*** Missing version history to be extracted from Perl changes ***


1.07  Fri Feb 23 1996 by Andreas Koenig
    - Gisle sent me a documentation patch that showed me, that the
      unless(/^#/) is unnessessary. Applied the patch and deleted the block
      checking for "comment" lines. -- All lines are comment lines that do
      not match /^1\.\.([0-9]+)/ or /^(not\s+)?ok\b/.
    - Ilyaz request to print "ok (empty test case)" whenever we say 1..0
      implemented.
    - Harness now doesn't abort anymore if we received confused test output,
      just warns instead.

1.05  Wed Jan 31 1996 by Andreas Koenig
    - More updates on docu and introduced the liberality that the script
      output may omit the test numbers.

1.03  Mon January 28 1996 by Andreas Koenig
    - Added the statistics for subtests. Updated the documentation.

1.02  by Andreas Koenig
    - This version reports a list of the tests that failed accompanied by
      some trivial statistics. The older (unnumbered) version stopped
      processing after the first failed test.
    - Additionally it reports the exit status if there is one.
