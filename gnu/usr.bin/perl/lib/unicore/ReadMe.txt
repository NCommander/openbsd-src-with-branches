This directory contains the Unicode Character Database
data files.

Currently, the Unicode Character Database files are at
the version level:

   Unicode Standard, Version 4.0.0

For information about the standard itself, see:

http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.0/

Detailed documentation of the files constituting the
Unicode Character Database (contributory data files for
the standard itself) can be found in UCD.html.

Unihan.txt is a very large file and is unchanged from
its Unicode 3.2.0 version. A zipped version is
also provided for downloading convenience: Unihan.zip.

The current Unicode 3.2.0 version of Unihan.txt is also available in
two compressed formats in the Unicode 3.2.0 update directory. See:
http://www.unicode.org/Public/3.2-Update/
or
ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/3.2-Update/

Unihan-3.2.0.zip for Windows. (Use winzip)
Unihan-3.2.0.txt.gz  for Unix.    (Use gzip or gunzip)

Note that the files are zipped in
exactly the same format they have on the server (with Unix
line endings). From a browser, right-clicking on 
Unihan-3.2.0.zip will allow automatic download and unzip on a
Windows system with winzip installed.
