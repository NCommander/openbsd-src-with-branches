This directory contains the Unicode Character Database
data files.

Currently, the Unicode Character Database files are at
the version level:

   Unicode Standard, Version 3.2.0

For information about the standard itself, see
UAX #28, Unicode 3.2. <http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr28/>.

Detailed documentation of the files constituting the
Unicode Character Database (contributory data files for
the standard itself) can be found in
UnicodeCharacterDatabase.html. See also UnicodeData.html,
PropList.html, NamesList.html, and DerivedProperties.html
for specific details about particular files or sets of
files.

Unihan.txt is a very large file. A zipped version is
also provided for downloading convenience: Unihan.zip.

The current Unicode 3.2.0 version of Unihan.txt is also available in
two compressed formats in the Unicode 3.2.0 update directory.
See: <http://www.unicode.org/Public/3.2-Update/> or
<ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/3.2-Update/>

Unihan-3.2.0.zip for Windows. (Use winzip)
Unihan-3.2.0.txt.gz  for Unix.    (Use gzip or gunzip)

Note that the files are zipped in
exactly the same format they have on the server (with Unix
line endings). From a browser, right-clicking on 
Unihan-3.2.0.zip will allow automatic download and unzip on a
Windows system with winzip installed.
