These files are used by Configure to set things which Configure either
can't or doesn't guess properly.  Many of these hints files are from
perl4.  They may or may not work with perl5, but they are probably a
good starting point.

The following hints files have been tested with at least some version
of perl5 and are probably reasonably close to being correct:

aix.sh
aux.sh
bsdos.sh
dec_osf.sh
dgux.sh
esix4.sh
freebsd.sh
hpux_9.sh
irix_4.sh
