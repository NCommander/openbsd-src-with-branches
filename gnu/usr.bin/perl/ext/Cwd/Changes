Revision history for Perl extension Cwd.

2.12  Fri Dec 19 17:04:52 CST 2003

 - Fixed a bug on Cygwin - the output of realpath() should have been
   tainted, but wasn't.  [Reported by Tom Wyant]

2.10  Mon Dec 15 07:50:12 CST 2003

 (Note that this release was mistakenly packaged as version 2.11, even
 though it had an internal $VERSION variable of 2.10.  Not sure how
 THAT happened...)

 - There was a dependency in the Makefile.PL on Module::Build, which
   isn't necessary.  I've removed it.

2.09  Thu Dec 11 20:30:58 CST 2003

 - The module should now build & install using version 5.6 of perl.

 - We now note a build-time dependency on version 0.19 of
   Module::Build, which is necessary because we don't use the standard
   lib/-based file layout.  No version of Module::Build is required if
   you use the Makefile.PL, just if you use the Build.PL .

 - Removed some gratuitous uses of 5.6-isms like our(), with the aim
   of backporting this module to perl 5.005.

 - Simplified all code that autoloads Carp.pm and calls
   carp()/croak().

 - Removed some redundant OS/2 code at the suggestion of Michael
   Schwern and Ilya Zakharevich.

 - Make sure the correct version of Cwd.pm is loaded in the regression
   tests. [Sam Vilain]

2.08  Wed Oct 15 20:56 CDT 2003

  - Code extracted from perl 5.8.1 and packaged as a separate CPAN
    release by Ken Williams.
