NAME

XS::APItest::KeywordRPN - write arithmetic expressions in RPN

DESCRIPTION

This module supplies plugged-in keywords, using the new mechanism in Perl
5.11.2, that allow arithmetic to be expressed in reverse Polish notation,
in an otherwise Perl program.  This module has serious limitations and
is not intended for real use: its purpose is only to test the keyword
plugin mechanism.  For that purpose it is part of the Perl core source
distribution, and is not meant to be installed.
