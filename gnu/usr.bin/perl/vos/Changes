This file documents the changes made to port Perl to the Stratus
VOS operating system.

After 5.005_63:
     Supplied "config.pl" perl script that takes "config_h.SH_orig"
          and "config.def" as input and produces "config.h.new".
          With some luck, you will just need to edit "config.def"
          to create a new port.
     Updated "build.cm".
     Updated "compile_perl.cm".
     Added   "config.def".
     Updated "config.h".
     Added   "config.pl".
     Updated "config_h.SH_orig".
     Updated "perl.bind".
     Updated "README.vos".
     Updated "vos_dummies.c".
     Updated "vosish.h".

after 5.005_02:
     Initial release.
     Supplied "build.cm" command macro to build perl.
     Supplied "Changes" to document the change history.
     Supplied "compile_perl.cm" to launch processes to compile all
          four versions of the Perl 5 binaries.
     Supplied "config.h" to configure Perl 5 to VOS. Unfortunately,
          since VOS does not have the configure tool, this file was
          built by hand by editing "config_h.SH".
     Supplied "config_h.SH_orig", which is the version of this file
          that was current for version 5.005_02. Use this to discover
          any subsequent changes to config_h.SH that must be
          hand-copied into the real config.h.
     Supplied "perl.bind" to control the VOS binder.
     Supplied "README.vos" to describe the VOS port.
     Supplied "test_vos_dummies.c" to test the VOS dummy functions.
     Supplied "vos_dummies.c" to trap unimplemented POSIX functions.
     Supplied "vosish.h" to configure Perl 5 to VOS.
