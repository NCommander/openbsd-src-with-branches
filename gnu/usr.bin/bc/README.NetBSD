This is GNU bc 1.03.

The original GNU distribution included GNU dc in the same distribution.
GNU dc part is found in the NetBSD source tree in /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/dc.

With all the files located in the bc and dc directories, an "original" 
bc-1.03 distribution could be regenerated.  (It require GNU autoconf 2.0.)
