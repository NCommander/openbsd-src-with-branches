These are the files that I used to make cc1 and cc1plus from gcc-2.5.8
for NetBSD/pc532.  They are included to allow you to build a compiler
yourself.

The files  netbsd.h, ns32k.c, ns32k.md, and xm-netbsd.h should be put
in the directory gcc-2.5.8/config/ns32k.  The file configure should be
put in the directory gcc-2.5.8.

You may have to change the files glimits.h, gstddef.h, gvarargs.h, and
gstdarg.h.  In file gxxxx.h adding an "#include <xxxx.h>" and a "#if 0"
at the beginning of the file and a "#endif" at the end of the file.

To build:

  a) "configure .... ns32k-pc532-netbsd"

  b) make cc1 cc1plus
