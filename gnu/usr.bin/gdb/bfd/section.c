SECTION
	Sections

	Sections are supported in BFD in <<section.c>>.

	The raw data contained within a BFD is maintained through the
	section abstraction.  A single BFD may have any number of
	sections, and keeps hold of them by pointing to the first,
	each one points to the next in the list.

SUBSECTION
	Section Input

	When a BFD is opened for reading, the section structures are
	created and attached to the BFD.

	Each section has a name which describes the section in the
	outside world - for example, <<a.out>> would contain at least
	three sections, called <<.text>>, <<.data>> and <<.bss>>. 

	Names need not be unique; for example a COFF file may have several
	sections named .data.

	Sometimes a BFD will contain more than the 'natural' number of
	sections. A back end may attach other sections containing
	constructor data, or an application may add a section (using
	bfd_make_section) to the sections attached to an already open
	BFD. For example, the linker creates a supernumary section
	<<COMMON>> for each input file's BFD to hold information about
	common storage.

	The raw data is not necessarily read in at the same time as
	the section descriptor is created. Some targets may leave the
	data in place until a <<bfd_get_section_contents>> call is
	made. Other back ends may read in all the data at once - For
	example; an S-record file has to be read once to determine the
	size of the data. An IEEE-695 file doesn't contain raw data in
	sections, but data and relocation expressions intermixed, so
	the data area has to be parsed to get out the data and
	relocations.

SUBSECTION
	Section Output

	To write a new object style BFD, the various sections to be
	written have to be created. They are attached to the BFD in
	the same way as input sections, data is written to the
	sections using <<bfd_set_section_contents>>.  

	Any program that creates or combines sections (e.g., the assembler
	and linker) must use the fields <<output_section>> and
	<<output_offset>> to indicate the file sections to which each
	section must be written.  (If the section is being created from
	scratch, <<output_section>> should probably point to the section
	itself, and <<output_offset>> should probably be zero.)

	The data to be written comes from input sections attached to
	the output sections.  The output section structure can be
	considered a filter for the input section, the output section
	determines the vma of the output data and the name, but the
	input section determines the offset into the output section of
	the data to be written.

	E.g., to create a section "O", starting at 0x100, 0x123 long,
	containing two subsections, "A" at offset 0x0 (ie at vma
	0x100) and "B" at offset 0x20 (ie at vma 0x120) the structures
	would look like:

|   section name          "A"
|     output_offset   0x00
|     size            0x20
|     output_section ----------->  section name    "O"
|                             |    vma             0x100
|   section name          "B" |    size            0x123
|     output_offset   0x20    |
|     size            0x103   |
|     output_section  --------|


SUBSECTION
	Seglets

	The data within a section is stored in a <<seglet>>.  These
	are much like the fixups in <<gas>>.  The seglet abstraction
	allows the a section to grow and shrink within itself.

	A seglet knows how big it is, and which is the next seglet and
	where the raw data for it is, and also points to a list of
	relocations which apply to it.

	The seglet is used by the linker to perform relaxing on final
	code.  The application creates code which is as big as
	necessary to make it work without relaxing, and the user can
	select whether to relax.  Sometimes relaxing takes a lot of
	time.  The linker runs around the relocations to see if any
	are attached to data which can be shrunk, if so it does it on
	a seglet by seglet basis.

DESCRIPTION
	Calls the provided function @var{func} for each section
	attached to the BFD @var{abfd}, passing @var{obj} as an
	argument. The function will be called as if by 

|	func(abfd, the_section, obj);

	This is the prefered method for iterating over sections, an
	alternative would be to use a loop:

|	   section *p;
|	   for (p = abfd->sections; p != NULL; p = p->next)
|	      func(abfd, p, ...)

DESCRIPTION
	Sets the contents of the section @var{section} in BFD

	@var{offset} for @var{count} bytes. 



	Normally <<true>> is returned, else <<false>>. Possible error
	returns are:
	o no_contents -
	The output section does not have the <<SEC_HAS_CONTENTS>>
	attribute, so nothing can be written to it.
	o and some more too

	This routine is front end to the back end function
	<<_bfd_set_section_contents>>.
