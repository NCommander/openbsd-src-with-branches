SECTION
	Symbols

	BFD trys to maintain as much symbol information as it can when
	it moves information from file to file. BFD passes information
	to applications though the <<asymbol>> structure. When the
	application requests the symbol table, BFD reads the table in
	the native form and translates parts of it into the internal
	format. To maintain more than the infomation passed to
	applications some targets keep some information `behind the
	scenes', in a structure only the particular back end knows
	about. For example, the coff back end keeps the original
	symbol table structure as well as the canonical structure when
	a BFD is read in. On output, the coff back end can reconstruct
	the output symbol table so that no information is lost, even
	information unique to coff which BFD doesn't know or
	understand. If a coff symbol table was read, but was written
	through an a.out back end, all the coff specific information
	would be lost. The symbol table of a BFD
	is not necessarily read in until a canonicalize request is
	made. Then the BFD back end fills in a table provided by the
	application with pointers to the canonical information.  To
	output symbols, the application provides BFD with a table of
	pointers to pointers to <<asymbol>>s. This allows applications
	like the linker to output a symbol as read, since the `behind
	the scenes' information will be still available.

SUBSECTION
	Reading Symbols

	There are two stages to reading a symbol table from a BFD;
	allocating storage, and the actual reading process. This is an
	excerpt from an appliction which reads the symbol table:

|	  unsigned int storage_needed;
|	  asymbol **symbol_table;
|	  unsigned int number_of_symbols;
|	  unsigned int i;
|	
|	  storage_needed = get_symtab_upper_bound (abfd);
|	
|	  if (storage_needed == 0) {
|	     return ;
|	  }
|	  symbol_table = (asymbol **) bfd_xmalloc (storage_needed);
|	    ...
|	  number_of_symbols = 
|	     bfd_canonicalize_symtab (abfd, symbol_table); 
|	
|	  for (i = 0; i < number_of_symbols; i++) {
|	     process_symbol (symbol_table[i]);
|	  }

	All storage for the symbols themselves is in an obstack
	connected to the BFD, and is freed when the BFD is closed.


INODE
Writing Symbols, typedef asymbol, Reading Symbols, Symbols
SUBSECTION
	Writing Symbols

	Writing of a symbol table is automatic when a BFD open for
	writing is closed. The application attaches a vector of
	pointers to pointers to symbols to the BFD being written, and
	fills in the symbol count. The close and cleanup code reads
	through the table provided and performs all the necessary
	operations. The outputing code must always be provided with an
	'owned' symbol; one which has come from another BFD, or one
	which has been created using <<bfd_make_empty_symbol>>.   An
	example showing the creation of a symbol table with only one element:

|	#include "bfd.h"
|	main() 
|	{
|	  bfd *abfd;
|	  asymbol *ptrs[2];
|	  asymbol *new;
|	
|	  abfd = bfd_openw("foo","a.out-sunos-big");
|	  bfd_set_format(abfd, bfd_object);
|	  new = bfd_make_empty_symbol(abfd);
|	  new->name = "dummy_symbol";
|	  new->section = bfd_make_section_old_way(abfd, ".text");
|	  new->flags = BSF_GLOBAL;
|	  new->value = 0x12345;
|	
|	  ptrs[0] = new;
|	  ptrs[1] = (asymbol *)0;
|	  
|	  bfd_set_symtab(abfd, ptrs, 1);
|	  bfd_close(abfd);
|	}
|	
|	./makesym 
|	nm foo
|	00012345 A dummy_symbol

	Many formats cannot represent arbitary symbol information; for
 	instance the <<a.out>> object format does not allow an
	arbitary number of sections. A symbol pointing to a section
	which is not one  of <<.text>>, <<.data>> or <<.bss>> cannot
	be described.
