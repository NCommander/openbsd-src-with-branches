/* The intention is that one day, all the code which uses sections
   will change and use seclets instead - maybe seglet would have been
   a better name..

   Anyway, a seclet contains enough info to be able to describe an
   area of output memory in one go.

   The only description so far catered for is that of the
   <<bfd_indirect_seclet>>, which is a select which points to a
   <<section>> and the <<asymbols>> associated with the section, so
   that relocation can be done when needed.

   One day there will be more types - they will at least migrate from
   the linker's data structures - also there could be extra stuff,
   like a bss seclet, which descibes a lump of memory as containing
   zeros compactly, without the horrible SEC_* flag cruft.

INTERNAL_FUNCTION
	bfd_generic_seclet_link

SYNOPSIS
	boolean bfd_generic_seclet_link
	 (bfd *abfd,
	  PTR data,
	  boolean relocateable);

DESCRIPTION

	The generic seclet linking routine.  The caller should have
	set up seclets for all the output sections.  The DATA argument
	should point to a memory area large enough to hold the largest
	section.  This function looks through the seclets and moves
	the contents into the output sections.  If RELOCATEABLE is
	true, the orelocation fields of the output sections must
	already be initialized.
