SECTION
	File Formats

	A format is a BFD concept of high level file contents. The
	formats supported by BFD are: 

	o bfd_object

	The BFD may contain data, symbols, relocations and debug info.

	o bfd_archive

	The BFD contains other BFDs and an optional index.

	o bfd_core

	The BFD contains the result of an executable core dump.

FUNCTION
	bfd_check_format

SYNOPSIS
	boolean bfd_check_format(bfd *abfd, bfd_format format);

DESCRIPTION
	This routine is supplied a BFD and a format. It attempts to
	verify if the file attached to the BFD is indeed compatible
	with the format specified (ie, one of <<bfd_object>>,
	<<bfd_archive>> or <<bfd_core>>).

	If the BFD has been set to a specific @var{target} before the
	call, only the named target and format combination will be
	checked. If the target has not been set, or has been set to
	<<default>> then all the known target backends will be
	interrogated to determine a match.  If the default target
	matches, it is used.  If not, exactly one target must recognize
	the file, or an error results.

	The function returns <<true>> on success, otherwise <<false>>
	with one of the following error codes:  

	o invalid_operation -
	if <<format>> is not one of <<bfd_object>>, <<bfd_archive>> or
	<<bfd_core>>.

	o system_call_error -
	if an error occured during a read - even some file mismatches
	can cause system_call_errors

	o file_not_recognised -
	none of the backends recognised the file format

	o file_ambiguously_recognized -
	more than one backend recognised the file format.
