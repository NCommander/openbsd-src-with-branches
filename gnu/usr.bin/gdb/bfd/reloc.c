SECTION
	Relocations

	BFD maintains relocations in much the same was as it maintains
	symbols; they are left alone until required, then read in
	en-mass and traslated into an internal form. There is a common
	routine <<bfd_perform_relocation>> which acts upon the
	canonical form to do the actual fixup.

	Note that relocations are maintained on a per section basis,
	whilst symbols are maintained on a per BFD basis.

	All a back end has to do to fit the BFD interface is to create
	as many <<struct reloc_cache_entry>> as there are relocations
	in a particular section, and fill in the right bits:

DESCRIPTION

        Here is a description of each of the fields within a relent:

        o sym_ptr_ptr

        The symbol table pointer points to a pointer to the symbol
        associated with the relocation request. This would naturally
        be the pointer into the table returned by the back end's
        get_symtab action. @xref{Symbols}. The symbol is referenced
        through a pointer to a pointer so that tools like the linker
        can fix up all the symbols of the same name by modifying only
        one pointer. The relocation routine looks in the symbol and
        uses the base of the section the symbol is attached to and the
        value of the symbol as the initial relocation offset. If the
        symbol pointer is zero, then the section provided is looked up.

        o address

        The address field gives the offset in bytes from the base of
        the section data which owns the relocation record to the first
        byte of relocatable information. The actual data relocated
        will be relative to this point - for example, a relocation
        type which modifies the bottom two bytes of a four byte word
        would not touch the first byte pointed to in a big endian
        world.
	
	o addend

	The addend is a value provided by the back end to be added (!)
	to the relocation offset. Its interpretation is dependent upon
	the howto. For example, on the 68k the code:


|        char foo[];
|        main()
|                {
|                return foo[0x12345678];
|                }

        Could be compiled into:

|        linkw fp,#-4
|        moveb @@#12345678,d0
|        extbl d0
|        unlk fp
|        rts


        This could create a reloc pointing to foo, but leave the
        offset in the data (something like)


|RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]:
|offset   type      value 
|00000006 32        _foo
|
|00000000 4e56 fffc          ; linkw fp,#-4
|00000004 1039 1234 5678     ; moveb @@#12345678,d0
|0000000a 49c0               ; extbl d0
|0000000c 4e5e               ; unlk fp
|0000000e 4e75               ; rts


        Using coff and an 88k, some instructions don't have enough
        space in them to represent the full address range, and
        pointers have to be loaded in two parts. So you'd get something like:


|        or.u     r13,r0,hi16(_foo+0x12345678)
|        ld.b     r2,r13,lo16(_foo+0x12345678)
|        jmp      r1


        This should create two relocs, both pointing to _foo, and with
        0x12340000 in their addend field. The data would consist of:


|RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]:
|offset   type      value 
|00000002 HVRT16    _foo+0x12340000
|00000006 LVRT16    _foo+0x12340000

|00000000 5da05678           ; or.u r13,r0,0x5678
|00000004 1c4d5678           ; ld.b r2,r13,0x5678
|00000008 f400c001           ; jmp r1


        The relocation routine digs out the value from the data, adds
        it to the addend to get the original offset and then adds the
        value of _foo. Note that all 32 bits have to be kept around
        somewhere, to cope with carry from bit 15 to bit 16.

        One further example is the sparc and the a.out format. The
        sparc has a similar problem to the 88k, in that some
        instructions don't have room for an entire offset, but on the
        sparc the parts are created odd sized lumps. The designers of
        the a.out format chose not to use the data within the section
        for storing part of the offset; all the offset is kept within
        the reloc. Any thing in the data should be ignored. 

|        save %sp,-112,%sp
|        sethi %hi(_foo+0x12345678),%g2
|        ldsb [%g2+%lo(_foo+0x12345678)],%i0
|        ret
|        restore

        Both relocs contains a pointer to foo, and the offsets would
        contain junk.


|RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]:
|offset   type      value 
|00000004 HI22      _foo+0x12345678
|00000008 LO10      _foo+0x12345678

|00000000 9de3bf90     ; save %sp,-112,%sp
|00000004 05000000     ; sethi %hi(_foo+0),%g2
|00000008 f048a000     ; ldsb [%g2+%lo(_foo+0)],%i0
|0000000c 81c7e008     ; ret
|00000010 81e80000     ; restore


        o howto 

        The howto field can be imagined as a
        relocation instruction. It is a pointer to a struct which
        contains information on what to do with all the other
        information in the reloc record and data section. A back end
        would normally have a relocation instruction set and turn
        relocations into pointers to the correct structure on input -
        but it would be possible to create each howto field on demand.

DESCRIPTION
	If an output_bfd is supplied to this function the generated
	image will be relocatable, the relocations are copied to the
	output file after they have been changed to reflect the new
	state of the world. There are two ways of reflecting the
	results of partial linkage in an output file; by modifying the
	output data in place, and by modifying the relocation record.
	Some native formats (e.g., basic a.out and basic coff) have no
	way of specifying an addend in the relocation type, so the
	addend has to go in the output data.  This is no big deal
	since in these formats the output data slot will always be big
	enough for the addend. Complex reloc types with addends were
	invented to solve just this problem.

	bfd_reloc_code_type

DESCRIPTION
	The insides of a reloc code.  The idea is that, eventually, there
	will be one enumerator for every type of relocation we ever do.
	Pass one of these values to <<bfd_reloc_type_lookup>>, and it'll
	return a howto pointer.

	This does mean that the application must determine the correct
	enumerator value; you can't get a howto pointer from a random set
	of attributes.
