NAME

	concat -- concatenate a variable number of strings

SYNOPSIS

	#include <varargs.h>

	char *concat (s1, s2, s3, ..., NULL)

DESCRIPTION

	Concatenate a variable number of strings and return the result
	in freshly malloc'd memory.

	Returns NULL if insufficient memory is available.  The argument
	list is terminated by the first NULL pointer encountered.  Pointers
	to empty strings are ignored.

NOTES

	This function uses xmalloc() which is expected to be a front end
	function to malloc() that deals with low memory situations.  In
	typical use, if malloc() returns NULL then xmalloc() diverts to an
	error handler routine which never returns, and thus xmalloc will
	never return a NULL pointer.  If the client application wishes to
	deal with low memory situations itself, it should supply an xmalloc
	that just directly invokes malloc and blindly returns whatever
	malloc returns.
