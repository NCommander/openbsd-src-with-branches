.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
\fBTcl_Exit\fR(\fIstatus\fR)
.sp
\fBTcl_CreateExitHandler\fR(\fIproc, clientData\fR)
.sp
\fBTcl_DeleteExitHandler\fR(\fIproc, clientData\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_ExitProc clientData

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_Exit\fR is the procedure that is invoked to end a Tcl application.
It is invoked by the \fBexit\fR command, as well as anyplace else that
terminates the application.
No-one should ever invoke the \fBexit\fR procedure directly;  always
invoke \fBTcl_Exit\fR instead, so that it can invoke exit handlers.
.PP
\fBTcl_CreateExitHandler\fR arranges for \fIproc\fR to be invoked
by \fBTcl_Exit\fR before it terminates the application.
This provides a hook for cleanup operations such as flushing buffers
and freeing global memory.
\fIProc\fR should have arguments and return value that match
the type \fBTcl_ExitProc\fR:
.CS
typedef void Tcl_ExitProc(ClientData \fIclientData\fR);
.CE
The \fIclientData\fR parameter to \fIproc\fR is a
copy of the \fIclientData\fR argument given to
\fBTcl_CreateExitHandler\fR when the callback
was created.  Typically, \fIclientData\fR points to a data
structure containing application-specific information about
what to do in \fIproc\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_DeleteExitHandler\fR may be called to delete a
previously-created exit handler.  It removes the handler
indicated by \fIproc\fR and \fIclientData\fR so that no call
to \fIproc\fR will be made.  If no such handler exists then
\fBTcl_DeleteExitHandler\fR does nothing.

.SH KEYWORDS
