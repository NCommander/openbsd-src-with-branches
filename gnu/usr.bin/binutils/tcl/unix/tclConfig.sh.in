# tclConfig.sh --
# 
# This shell script (for sh) is generated automatically by Tcl's
# configure script.  It will create shell variables for most of
# the configuration options discovered by the configure script.
# This script is intended to be included by the configure scripts
# for Tcl extensions so that they don't have to figure this all
# out for themselves.

# The information in this file is specific to a single platform.

# Flags to pass to ld, such as "-R /usr/local/tcl/lib", that tell the
