/* System defines for OpenBSD.
   If you think you need to change this file, then you are wrong.  In order to
   avoid a huge ugly mass of nested #ifdefs, you should create a new file just
   for your system, which contains exactly those #includes and definitions that
   your system needs, AND NOTHING MORE!  Then, add that file to the appropriate
   place in configure.in, and viola, you are done.  sysdep-sunos4.h is a good
   example of how to do this. */
