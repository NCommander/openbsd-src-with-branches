o - size
    Currently assumes that the only relevant sections are named .text,
    .data and either .bss or .stack.  This is not very general, and it
    doesn't work for ECOFF.

o - strip
    Make faster by using ftruncate if available (and format is suitable).

o - nm, objdump
    Add option to demangle C++ names.

o - nm, BFD
    Print more information about the symbols for more object file formats.
    Print the symbol size in POSIX format.

o - See also ../ld/TODO and ../bfd/TODO.

o - ar q is flakey: e.g., doesn't handle long file names properly.

o - objdump -d:  Print relocatable addresses intelligently.
