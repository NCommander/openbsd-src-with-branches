This is GNU grep 2.0, the "fastest grep in the west" (we hope).  All
bugs reported in previous releases have been fixed.  Many exciting new
bugs have probably been introduced in this major revision.

GNU grep is provided "as is" with no warranty.  The exact terms
under which you may use and (re)distribute this program are detailed
in the GNU General Public License, in the file COPYING.

GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
look at every character.  The result is typically many times faster
than Unix grep or egrep.  (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
will run more slowly, however.)
