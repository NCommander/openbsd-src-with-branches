/*
  NAME
  xmalloc() - get memory or bust
  INDEX
  xmalloc() uses malloc()
  
  SYNOPSIS
  char *	my_memory;
  
  my_memory = xmalloc(42); / * my_memory gets address of 42 chars * /
  
  DESCRIPTION
  
  Use xmalloc() as an "error-free" malloc(). It does almost the same job.
  When it cannot honour your request for memory it BOMBS your program
  with a "virtual memory exceeded" message. Malloc() returns NULL and
  does not bomb your program.
