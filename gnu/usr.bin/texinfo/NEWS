This file records noteworthy changes.

3.9 (4 October 1996)
* makeinfo:
  - Give a suppressible (with --no-validate) error for references
    outside of any node.
  - Keep track of multitable output correctly for split files; this
    caused nodes after the first multitable to be ``undefined''.
* install-info:
  - Rename --infodir option to --info-dir.
  - More robust error checking to avoid various crashes.
* configure: Include replacements for memcpy and memmove functions in
  the distribution, in case they are missing.

3.8 (30 September 1996)
* Define and/or document new and/or previously existing commands:
  Accents: @" @' @, @" @= @^ @` @~ @H @d @dotaccent @dotless @ringaccent
    @tieaccent @u @ubaraccent @v
  Special characters: @AA @AE @L @O @OE @aa @ae @exclamdown @l @o @oe
    @pounds @questiondown @ss
  Special punctuation: @! @? @enddots
  dir file maintenance: @dircategory @direntry; also new program, install-info
  HTML support: @email @url @ifhtml...@end ifhtml
  Macros: @macro @unmacro
  Tables: @multitable @tab
  Hyphenation: @- @hyphenation
  Spacing: @  @<TAB> @<NEWLINE>
  Sectioning:
    @headings singleafter/doubleafter (change heading style after current page)
    @centerchap
    @setchapterstyle
  Other:
    @shorttitlepage (simple title pages)
    @detailmenu...@end detailmenu (help makeinfo parse master menus)
* Makeinfo prefers an input file named `foo.texinfo' or `foo.texi' or
  `foo.txinfo' to just `foo' (the latter most likely being an executable).
* Makeinfo implements @. @! @? correctly, as end-of-sentence punctuation.
* @key marks its argument with a lozenge in TeX and <...> in Info.
* TeX output has substantially decreased interline spacing and other
  formatting changes.
* Remove these obsolete and never-documented commands:
    @infotop
    @infoappendix @infoappendixsec @infoappendixsubsec @infoappendixsubsubsec
    @infochapter @infosection @infosubsection @infosubsubsection
    @infounnumbered @infounnumberedsec @infounnumberedsubsec
      @infounnumberedsubsubsec
    @input
    @smallbreak @medbreak
    @overfullrule
    @br
* Deprecate these obsolete commands, to be removed in the next release:
    @ctrl
    @infoinclude
    @iappendix @iappendixsection @iappendixsec @iappendixsubsec
      @iappendixsubsubsec
    @ichapter @isection @isubsection @isubsubsection 
    @iunnumbered @iunnumberedsec @iunnumberedsubsec @iunnumberedsubsubsec
    @setchapterstyle
