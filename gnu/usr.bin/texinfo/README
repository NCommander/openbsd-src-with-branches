There are as yet no corresponding newsgroups.

For bug reports, please include enough information for the maintainers
to reproduce the problem.  Generally speaking, that means:
- the contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the bug (crucial!).
- a description of the problem and any samples of the erroneous output.
- the version number of Texinfo and the program(s) involved (use --version).
- hardware, operating system, and compiler versions (uname -a).
- any unusual options you gave to configure (see config.status).
- anything else that you think would be helpful.

Patches are most welcome; if possible, please make them with diff -c and
include ChangeLog entries.

When sending email, please do not encode or split the messages in any
way if at all possible; it's easier to deal with one large message than
many small ones.  GNU shar is a convenient way of packaging multiple
and/or binary files for email.


For generic installation instructions on compiling and installing this
Automake-based distribution, please read the file `INSTALL'.
Installation notes specific to Texinfo:

* The Info tree uses a file `dir' as its root node; the `dir-example'
  file in this distribution is included as a possible starting point.
  Use it, modify it, or ignore it just as you like.

* You can create a file texinfo.cnf to be read by TeX when
  processing Texinfo manuals.  For example, you might like to use
  @afourpaper by default.  See the `Preparing for TeX' node in
  texinfo.txi for more details.  You don't have to create the file if
  you have nothing to put in it.

* If your info files are not in $prefix/info, you may wish to add a line
#define DEFAULT_INFOPATH "/mydir1:/mydir2:..."
  to config.h after running configure.

* For instructions on compiling this distribution with DJGPP tools
  for MS-DOS and MS-Windows, see the file djgpp/README.


If you would like to contribute to the GNU project by implementing
additional documentation output formats for Texinfo, that would be
great.  But please do not write a separate translator texi2foo for your
favorite format foo!  That is the hard way to do the job, and makes
extra work in subsequent maintenance, since the Texinfo language is
continually being enhanced and updated.  Instead, the best approach is
modify Makeinfo to generate the new format, as it does now for Info,
HTML, XML, and DocBook.

If you want to convert from DocBook to Texinfo, please see 
http://docbook2X.sourceforge.net/.

    NEWS                        Summary of new features by release.

    INTRODUCTION                Brief introduction to the system, and
                                how to create readable files from the
                                Texinfo source files in this distribution.

Texinfo source files (in ./doc):
    texinfo.txi                 Describes the Texinfo language and many
                                of the associated tools.  It tells how
                                to use Texinfo to write documentation,
                                how to use Texinfo mode in GNU Emacs,
                                TeX, makeinfo, and the Emacs Lisp
                                Texinfo formatting commands.

    info.texi                   This manual tells you how to use 
                                Info.  This document comes as part of
                                GNU Emacs.  If you do not have Emacs,
                                you can format this Texinfo source
                                file with makeinfo or TeX and then
                                read the resulting Info file with the
                                standalone Info reader that is part of
                                this distribution.

    info-stnd.texi              This manual tells you how to use
                                the standalone GNU Info reader that is
                                included in this distribution as C
                                source (./info).
