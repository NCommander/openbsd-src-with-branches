Installation notes specific to Texinfo:

    * The Info tree uses a file `dir' as its root node; the `dir-example'
      file in this distribution is included for informative purposes.
      Use it, modify it, or ignore it just as you like.

    * You can create a file texinfo.cnf to be read by TeX when
      processing Texinfo manuals.  For example, it might contain the
      command @afourpaper.  See the `Preparing for TeX' node in
      texinfo.texi for more details.

    * If your info files are not in $prefix/info, you may wish to add a line
#define DEFAULT_INFOPATH "/mydir1:/mydir2:/etc"
      to config.h after running configure.


This distribution includes (but is not limited to) the following files:

    README                      This file.
    INTRODUCTION                Brief introduction to the system, and
                                how to create readable files from the
                                Texinfo source files in this distribution.

    texinfo.texi                This manual describes the Texinfo language
                                and many of the associated tools.  It
                                tells how to use Texinfo to write
                                documentation, how to use Texinfo mode
                                in GNU Emacs, TeX, makeinfo, and the
                                Emacs Lisp Texinfo formatting commands.

    info.texi                   This manual tells you how to use 
                                Info.  This document comes as part of
                                GNU Emacs.  If you do not have Emacs,
                                you can format this Texinfo source
                                file with makeinfo or TeX and then
                                read the resulting Info file with the
                                standalone Info reader that is part of
                                this distribution.

    info-stnd.texi              This manual tells you how to use
                                the standalone GNU Info reader that is
                                included in this distribution as C
                                source (./info).

    doc/texinfo.tex             This TeX definitions file tells
                                the TeX program how to typeset a
                                Texinfo file into a DVI file ready for
                                printing.

    util/texindex.c             This file contains the source for
                                the `texindex' program that generates
                                sorted indices used by TeX when
                                typesetting a file for printing.

    util/texi2dvi               This is a shell script for

                                TeX and texindex. Must be used if the
                                source document uses Texinfo @macros.

                                use to create an Info file from a
                                Texinfo file.

    info.c                      This file contains the source for
