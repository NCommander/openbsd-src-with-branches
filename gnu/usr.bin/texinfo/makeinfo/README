makeinfo is a standalone program to convert Texinfo source into Info
files readable with standalone info or M-x info in Emacs.

makeinfo can also output plain ASCII.  Work to support HTML and Troff
output is almost complete.

The Emacs function M-x texinfo-format-buffer does more or less the same
job, but makeinfo is faster and gives better error messages.
