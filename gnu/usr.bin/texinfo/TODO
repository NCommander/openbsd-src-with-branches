If you are interested in working on any of these, email bug-texinfo@gnu.org.

* Makeinfo:
  - Try directory of main source file.
  - Support @`{@dotless{i}} et al. in HTML.
  - A detexinfo program, like detex or delatex.  This command would
    strip all the texinfo commands out, and would be used as a filter on
    the way to a speller.  An option would be to NOT strip comments out.
    makeinfo --no-headers comes close.
  - If node name contains an @ command, complain explicitly.
  - Call Ghostscript to get ASCII/jpg output for the @image command.
  - Better HTML output: allow settable background color, table colors
    and spacing, <head> meta tags, back link from footnote marker, etc.
  - Rewrite completely to simplify generation of different formats.

* TeX:
  - Use @ as the escape character, and Texinfo syntax generally, in the
    table of contents, aux, and index files.  Eliminate all the crazy
    multiple redefinitions of every Texinfo command in different contexts.
  - Handle @hsep and @vsep in @multitables.
  - Introduce new command to change \bindingoffset.
  - Reasonable way to change fonts from the default (some work has been
    done), to allow for PostScript fonts, for example.
  - How about using latex2html to produce HTML?
  - Support 8-bit input characters, perhaps via the ec fonts.
  - Repeat table headings if a @multitable is multiple pages long.
  - Table of contents gets misaligned if there are 10 or more [sub]sections.

* General:
  - Rationalize and improve the dir categories in existing manuals.
  - @xindexterm [def] primary [,secondary [,tertiary]]  or some such?
  - Support compressed image files.
  - Handle reference card creation, perhaps by only paying attention to
    sectioning and @def... commands.
  - Allow @end (and other?) commands to be indented in the source.
  - Get Info declared as a MIME Content-Type.

* Language:
  - @figure:
@figure [xref-label]
@figureinclude <filename>, [<height>], [<width>]
@figurehsize <dimen>
@figurevsize <dimen>
@caption ... @end caption
<arbitrary Texinfo commands>
@end figure
  - multicolumn * width to take up `the rest'.
  - another table command to take N succeeding items and split them
    into M columns (see eplain).
  - support bibliographies with BibTeX (see web2c/doc for kludge prototype).
  - @flushboth to combine @flushleft and @flushright, for RFC's.
  - @part sectioning command.
  - Allow subitems and `see' and `see also' in indices.
  - @exercise/@answer command for, e.g., gawk.
  - Allow @hsep/@vsep at @item, instead of just in template.
  - Support automatic line numbering of examples.
  - Better macro syntax.
  - Allow : in node names for info files, for names like
    `class::method'.  Likewise index entries.  A quoting mechanism such
    as surrounding node names with SPACE BACKSPACE is probably the best
    solution, although this is an incompatible change to Info format, sigh.
  - Change bars.  This is difficult or impossible in TeX,
    unfortunately.  To do it right requires device driver support.
    wdiff or ediff may be all we can do.

* Doc:
  - Include a complete functional summary, as in a reference card, in
    the manual.
  - Improve the manuals, especially for makeinfo, standalone info, etc.
  - new section on doing dedication pages. See gawk.texi
    for an example of doing it in both the tex and info versions.

* Info:
  - Regular expression search.
  - Full-text search across all info files installed on the system.
  - Support character sets other than ISO Latin 1.
  - Perhaps comply with LANGUAGE setting on a per-node basis, to allow
    incremental translation of Texinfo files.
  - Search all nodes of dir file at startup, then can have
    INFO-DIR-SEPARATE-GROUPS and other such.
  - Better dir file merging.
  - Steal interface ideas from Lynx: number links, use color, etc.
    Perhaps code from the pinfo viewer can be reused:
    http://zeus.polsl.gliwice.pl/~pborys/.
  - More sample .infokey files, so people can choose without writing their own.
  - q within help should quit help like C-x 0.
  - Incorporate an X-based viewer, perhaps tkinfo
      http://www.math.ucsb.edu/~boldt/tkinfo/
    or saxinfo.

* PDF:
  - make each letter of the index (A, B, ...) a section in the TOC.
    From Carsten Dominik <dominik@astro.uva.nl>.

  
* install-info:
  - be able to copy the info file to compile-time $(infodir), to
    simplify by-hand installation.


Ideas that will not be implemented:
- Process Texinfo files directly instead of converting to Info:
  ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/people/phelps/tcltk/tkman.tar.Z, which
  uses Tcl/Tk 8.0 from ftp.smli.com in the /pub/tcl directory.
  From: phelps@ecstasy.CS.Berkeley.EDU (Tom Phelps)
  [This has the disadvantage of needing to be updated when the
  Texinfo language changes, so don't.]

- Split HTML output by chapter.
  [Then cross-references in HTML cannot be generated consistently.]
