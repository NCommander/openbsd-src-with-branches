If you are interested in working on any of these, email bug-texinfo@gnu.org.

* Makeinfo:
  - Support output of Docbook format and SGML-Tools format.
  - Support output of true 8-bit characters from accent commands, etc.
  - A detexinfo program, like detex or delatex.  This command would
    strip all the texinfo commands out, and would be used as a filter on
    the way to a speller.  An option would be to NOT strip comments out.
    makeinfo --no-headers comes close.
  - If node name contains an @ command, complain explicitly.
  - Better ASCII output: convert menus to single table of contents,
    enumerate chapters and sections, convert cross-refs and indices to
    chapter/section references.  See:
       ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2/faq201s.zip
  - Call Ghostscript to get ASCII output for the @image command.
  - Better HTML output: allow settable background color, table colors
    and spacing, <head> meta tags, back link from footnote marker, etc.
  - Could warn if @sc{TEXT} for all-caps TEXT, since it's a no-op.

* TeX:
  - Use @ as the escape character, and Texinfo syntax generally, in the
    table of contents, aux, and index files.  Eliminate all the crazy
    multiple redefinitions of every Texinfo command in different contexts.
  - Handle @hsep and @vsep in @multitables.
  - Introduce new command to change \bindingoffset.
  - How about using latex2html to produce HTML?

* General:
  - Better i18n support, including support for 8-bit input characters,
    and 8-bit output in info.  Perhaps have to use the ec fonts.
  - Support compressed image files, automatic generation of .txt
    or .jpg from .eps by Ghostscript.
  - Handle reference card creation, perhaps by only paying attention to
    sectioning and @def... commands.
  - Allow : in node names for info files, for names like `class::method'.
  - Allow @end (and other?) commands to be indented in the source.
  - Get Info declared as a MIME Content-Type.

* Language:
  - @figure:
@figure [xref-label]
@figureinclude <filename>, [<height>], [<width>]
@figurehsize <dimen>
@figurevsize <dimen>
@caption ... @end caption
<arbitrary Texinfo commands>
@end figure
  - support bibliographies with BibTeX (see web2c/doc for kludge prototype).
  - @flushboth to combine @flushleft and @flushright, for RFC's.
  - @part sectioning command.
  - Allow subitems and `see' and `see also' in indices.
  - @verbatim ... @end verbatim.
  - @exercise/@answer command for, e.g., gawk.
  - Allow @hsep/@vsep at @item, instead of just in template.
  - The dark corner symbol for the gawk manual.
  - Support automatic line numbering of examples.
  - Change bars.  This is difficult or impossible in TeX,
    unfortunately.  To do it right requires device driver support.
    wdiff or ediff may be better in some cases, anyway.

* Doc:
  - Include a complete functional summary, as in a reference card, in
    the manual.
  - Improve the manuals for makeinfo, standalone info, etc.
  - Page 39, need a new section on doing dedication pages. See gawk.texi
    for an example of doing it in both the tex and info versions.

* Info:
  - Regular expression search.
  - Allow key rebinding, perhaps through the readline library.
  - Full-text search across all info files installed on the system.
  - Support character sets other than ISO Latin 1.
  - Perhaps comply with LANGUAGE setting on a per-node basis, to allow
    incremental translation of Texinfo files.
  - Search all nodes of dir file at startup, then can have
    INFO-DIR-SEPARATE-GROUPS and other such.
  - Better dir file merging.
  - Steal interface ideas from Lynx: TAB for navigating to next link
    within a page, number links, use color, etc.  Perhaps code from the pinfo
    viewer can be reused: http://zeus.polsl.gliwice.pl/~pborys/.
  - q within help should quit help like C-x 0.
  - Incorporate an X-based viewer, perhaps tkinfo
      http://www.math.ucsb.edu/~boldt/tkinfo/
    or saxinfo.
  - Perhaps process Texinfo files directly instead of converting to Info:
    ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/people/phelps/tcltk/tkman.tar.Z
    + ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/people/phelps/tcltk/rman.tar.Z
    + Tcl/Tk 8.0 from ftp.smli.com in the /pub/tcl directory.
    From: phelps@ecstasy.CS.Berkeley.EDU (Tom Phelps)
    (But this has the disadvantage of needing to be updated when the
    Texinfo language changes, so don't.)

* Install-info:
  - be able to copy the info file to compile-time $(infodir), to
    simplify by-hand installation.
