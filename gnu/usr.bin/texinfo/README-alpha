Please report bugs in this alpha distribution to
  texinfo-pretest@cs.umb.edu
rather than bug-texinfo@prep.  Thanks.

You can get on texinfo-pretest, if you're not already,
by sending a message whose body is
  subscribe you@your.preferred.email.address

to texinfo-pretest-request@cs.umb.edu.
And you can get off the list by sending an unsubscribe message.
(I use majordomo to maintain the list.)
