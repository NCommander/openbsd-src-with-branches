# Commentary:

# Author: Noah Friedman <friedman@prep.ai.mit.edu>

# Please send bug reports, etc. to bug-texinfo@prep.ai.mit.edu
# If possible, please send a copy of the output of the script called with
# the `--debug' option when making a bug report.

# In the interest of general portability, some common bourne shell
# constructs were avoided because they weren't guaranteed to be available
# in some earlier implementations.  I've tried to make this program as
# portable as possible.  Welcome to unix, where the lowest common
# denominator is rapidly diminishing.
#
# Among the more interesting lossages I noticed with some bourne shells
# are:
#     * No shell functions.
#     * No `unset' builtin.
#     * `shift' cannot take a numeric argument, and signals an error if
#       there are no arguments to shift.

# Code:

# Name by which this script was invoked.
progname=`echo "$0" | sed -e 's/[^\/]*\///g'`

# This string is expanded by rcs automatically when this file is checked out.
rcs_revision='$Revision: 1.10 $'
version=`set - $rcs_revision; echo $2`

# To prevent hairy quoting and escaping later.
bq='`'
eq="'"

usage="Usage: $0 [OPTION]... FILE...
Run a Texinfo document through TeX.

Options:
-D, --debug          Turn on shell debugging ($bq${bq}set -x$eq$eq).
-t, --texinfo CMD    Insert CMD after @setfilename before running TeX.
--verbose            Report on what is done.
-h, --help           Display this help and exit.
-v, --version        Display version information and exit.

The values of the TEX, TEXINDEX, and MAKEINFO environment variables are
used to run those commands, if they are set.
