TODO list for the g77 library

* `Makefile.in's should be brought up to standard; I'm not sure they
  have a complete set of targets at present.

* Investigate building shared libraries on systems we know about.

* Test cases.

* Allow the library to be stripped to save space.

* An interface to IEEE maths functions from libc where this makes
  sense.

* TeXinfo Documentation of the user-callable routines.
