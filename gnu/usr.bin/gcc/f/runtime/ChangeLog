Fri Feb 28 13:16:50 1997  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Version 0.5.20 released.

Wed Feb 26 20:28:53 1997  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: $(MAKE) invocations now explicitly
	specify `-f Makefile', just in case the `makefile's
	from the netlib distribution would get used instead.

Mon Feb 24 16:43:39 1997  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* libU77/Makefile.in (check): Specify driver, and
	don't bother enabling already-enabled intrinsic groups.
	Also, get the $(srcdir) version of u77-test.f.

Sat Feb 22 14:08:42 1997  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* libU77/u77-test.f: Explicitly declare intrinsics, get
	rid of useless CHARACTER declarations on intrinsics (maybe
	someday appropriate to implement meaning of that in g77
	and restore them?).
	Add spin loop just to fatten up the timings a bit.
	Clarify ETIME output as having three fields.
	Call TIME with CHARACTER*8, not CHARACTER*6, argument.
	Call new SECOND intrinsic subroutine, after calling
	new DUMDUM subroutine just to ensure the correct value
	doesn't get left around in a register or something.

Thu Feb 20 15:22:42 1997  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* libU77/bes.c: Comment out all the code, as g77 avoids actually
	calling it, going directly to the system's library instead.

Mon Feb 17 02:27:41 1997  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* libU77/fgetc_.c (fgetc_): Allow return value to be
	CHARACTER*(*), properly handle CHARACTER*0 and blank-pad
	CHARACTER*n where n>1.

Tue Feb 11 14:12:19 1997  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Clarify role of $(srcdir) here.  Fix
	various targets accordingly.  Don't rely at all on
	gcc/f/include/ being a link to gcc/include/ -- just
	use it directly.
	(${srcdir}/configure, ${srcdir}/libU77/configure):
	Remove the config.cache files in build directory before
	cd'ing to source directory as well.

	* libF77/Makefile.in, libI77/Makefile.in (ALL_CFLAGS):
	Include `-I.' to pick up build directory.
	Use gcc/include/ directly.
	* libU77/Makefile.in (ALL_CFLAGS): Include `-I$(srcdir)'
	to pick up source directory.
	(OBJS): Fix typo in `chmod_.o' (was `chmod.o').

Mon Feb 10 12:54:47 1997  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (UOBJ), libU77/Makefile.in (OBJS): Add
	libU77/chmod_.o to list of objects.
	* libU77/chmod_.c: Fix up headers.
	Fix implementation to not prematurely truncate command
	string and make room for trailing null.

	* libU77/ctime_.c: Incoming xstime argument is now longint.
	* libU77/mclock_.c: Now returns longint.
	* libU77/time_.c: Now returns longint.

1997-02-10  Dave Love  <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

	* etime_.c, dtime_.c: Typo rounded times to seconds.

	* date_.c: Add missing return.

	* hostnm_.c: #include unistd.h.

Sat Feb  8 03:30:19 1997  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	INTEGER*8 support built in to f2c.h and libf2c (since
	gcc will be used to compile relevant code anyway):
	* Makefile.in, libF77/Makefile.in: Add pow_qq.o,
	qbitbits.o, and qbitshft.o to $POW and $F90BIT macros,
	as appropriate.
	* f2c.h.in: Define appropriate types and macros.
	Place #error directive correctly.
	* configure.in: Determine appropriate types for long
	integer (F2C_LONGINT).
	Meanwhile, quote strings in #error, for consistency.
	Fix restoring of ac_cpp macro.
	* configure: Regenerated using autoconf-2.12.

	* libF77/Version.c, libI77/Version.c, libU77/Version.c:
	Update version numbers.
	Change names and code for g77-specific version-printing
	routines (shorter names should be safer to link on
	weird, 8-char systems).

	* libF77/c_cos.c, libF77/c_div.c, libF77/c_exp.c,
	libF77/c_log.c, libF77/c_sin.c, libF77/c_sqrt.c,
	libF77/d_cnjg.c, libF77/pow_zi.c, libF77/r_cnjg.c,
	libF77/z_cos.c, libF77/z_div.c, libF77/z_exp.c,
	libF77/z_log.c, libF77/z_sin.c, libF77/z_sqrt.c:
	Changed to work properly even when result is aliased
	with any inputs.

	* libF77/makefile, libI77/makefile: Leave these in
	the g77 distribution, so it is easier to track changes
	to official libf2c.

	* libF77/signal_.c: Eliminate redundant `return 0;'.

	* libI77/fio.h (err, errfl): Fix these so they work
	(and must be expressed) as statements.
	Fix up many users of err() to include trailing semicolon.

	* Incorporate changes by Bell Labs to libf2c through 1997-02-07.

1997-02-06  Dave Love  <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

	* libU77/etime_.c, libU77/dtime_.c: Fix getrusage stuff.

	* libU77/config.h.in: Regenerate for HAVE_GETRUSAGE.

	* libU77/Makefile.in, libI77/Makefile.in, libF77/Makefile.in:
	Redo *clean targets; distclean and maintainer-clean remove the stage?
	and include links.  This probably want looking at further.

Wed Feb  5 00:21:23 1997  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	Add libU77 library from Dave Love <d.love@dl.ac.uk>:
	* Makefile.in: Add libU77 directory, rules, etc.
	* configure.in: New libU77 directory, Makefile, etc.

	* Makefile.in, libF77/Makefile.in, libI77/Makefile.in,
	libU77/Makefile.in: Reorganize these so $(AR) commands
	handled by the top-level Makefile instead of the
	subordinates.  This permits it to do $(AR) only when
	one or more object files actually change, instead of
	having to force-update it as was necessary before.
	And that had the disadvantage of requiring, e.g., user
	root to have access to $(AR) to the library simply to
	install g77, which might be problematic on an NFS setup.
	(mostlyclean, clean, distclean, maintainer-clean):
	Properly handle these rules.

	* Makefile.in: Don't invoke config.status here -- let
	compiler-level stuff handle all that.

	* err.c [MISSING_FILE_ELEMS]: Declare malloc in this case
	too, so it doesn't end up as an integer.

Sat Feb  1 02:43:48 1997  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* libF77/Makefile.in: More fixup for $(F90BIT) -- wasn't
	in list for ar command, and it wasn't correctly listed
	in the list of things depending on f2c.h.

	* f2c.h.in: Fix up #error directive.

1997-01-31  Dave Love  <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

	* libF77/Makefile.in ($(lib)): Add $(F90BIT); shouldn't exclude
	stuff f2c needs so we can share the library.

Sat Jan 18 19:39:03 1997  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: No longer define ALWAYS_FLUSH, the
	resulting performance is too low.

Wed Dec 18 12:06:02 1996  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	Patch from Mumit Khan <khan@xraylith.wisc.edu>:
	* libF77/s_paus.c: Add __CYGWIN32__ to list of macros
	controlling how to pause.

Sun Dec  1 21:25:27 1996  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* configure: Regenerated using autoconf-2.12.

Mon Nov 25 21:16:15 1996  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* configure: Regenerated using autoconf-2.11.

1996-11-19  Dave Love  <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

	* libI77/backspace.c: Include sys/types.h for size_t.

Wed Nov  6 14:17:27 1996  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* f2c.h.in: Properly comment out the unsupported stuff so
	we don't get build-time errors.

	* libF77/Version.c, libI77/Version.c: Restore macro definition
	of version information.

	* libI77/Makefile.in (OBJ): Add ftell_.o to list of objects.

	* libI77/uio.c (do_ud): Fix up casts in PAD_UDread case just
	like they were fixed in the other case.

Thu Oct 31 22:27:45 1996  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* libI77/ftell_.c (fseek_): Map incoming whence argument to
	system's actual SEEK_CUR, SEEK_SET, or SEEK_END macro for
	fseek(), and crash (gracefully) if the argument is invalid.

1996-10-19  Dave Love  <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

	* configure.in: Add check that we have the tools to cross-compile
 	if appropriate.
	(NO_EOF_CHAR_CHECK,Skip_f2c_Undefs): Define.

	* libF77/Makefile.in (F90BIT): New routines from Netlib.

	* f2c.h.in:
	Use more sanitary #error (indented for K&R compliance if necessary) if
	f2c_i2 defined.
	Sync with Netlib: Add `uninteger'.  (Commented out) integer*8 stuff.
	bit_{test,clear,set} macros.

1996-10-19  Dave Love  <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

	Update to Netlib version of 1996-09-26.
	
	* libI77/Version.c: Use <stdio.h>, not "stdio.h".
	* libF77/Version.c: Likewise.

Wed Aug 28 13:25:29 1996  Dave Love  <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

	* libI77/rsne.c (x_rsne): Use size_t instead of int.

	* libI77/endfile.c (copy): Use size_t in place of int.

Wed Aug 28 13:22:20 1996  Dave Love  <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

	* libI77/backspace.c (f_back): Cast fread arg to size_t.

Tue Aug 27 19:11:30 1996  Dave Love  <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

	* libI77/Version.c: Supply */ to avoid apparent nested comment.

Tue Aug 20 09:21:43 1996  Dave Love  <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

	* libF77/Makefile.in (ALL_CFLAGS): Fix missing ../ for include.
	* libI77/Makefile.in (ALL_CFLAGS): Likewise.

Sat Aug 17 13:00:47 1996  Dave Love  <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

 	libF77/lbitbits.c): New file from Netlib.  qbit... not currently
	compiled.

 	{RANLIB,AR}_FOR_TARGET.
	* Makefile.in: Likewise.
	* libF77/Makefile.in: Likewise.
	* libI77/Makefile.in: Likewise.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Sat Mar 30 21:02:03 1996  Dave Love  <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

	* Makefile.in: Eliminate explicit use of
 	{RANLIB,AR}_FOR_TARGET.

Tue Mar 26 23:39:59 1996  Dave Love  <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

	* Makefile.in: Remove hardwired RANLIB and RANLIB_TEST (unnoted
 	change).

Mon Mar 25 21:04:56 1996  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Incorporate changes by Bell Labs to libf2c through 1996-03-23,
	including changes to dmg and netlib email addresses.

Tue Mar 19 13:10:02 1996  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Incorporate changes by AT&T/Bellcore to libf2c through 1996-03-19.

	* Makefile.in (rebuilt): New target.

	* lib[FI]77/Makefile.in: Use $AR_FOR_TARGET, not $AR.

Tue Mar 19 12:53:19 1996  Dave Love  <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

	* configure.in (ac_cpp): #include <stdio.h> instead
	of <features.h>.

Tue Mar 19 12:52:09 1996  Mumit Khan  <khan@xraylith.wisc.edu>

	* configure.in (ac_cpp): For f2c integer type,
	add -I$srcdir/../.. to make it work on mips-ultrix4.2.

Sat Mar  9 17:37:15 1996  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* libI77/Makefile.in (.c.o): Add -DAllow_TYQUAD, to enable

	* f2c.h.in: Turn on longint type.

Fri Dec 29 18:22:01 1995  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Reorganize the *clean rules to more closely
	parallel gcc's.

	* lib[FI]77/Makefile.in: Ignore error from $(AR) command,
	in case just doing an install and installer has no write
	access to library (this is a kludge fix -- perhaps install
	targets should never try updating anything?).

Sat Nov 18 19:37:22 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 0.5.17 released.

Thu Nov 16 07:20:35 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Incorporate changes by AT&T/Bellcore to libf2c through 1995-11-15.

Fri Sep 22 02:19:59 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* libI77/backspace.c, libI77/close.c, libI77/endfile.c,
	libI77/fio.h, libI77/inquire.c, libI77/rawio.h,
	libF77/s_paus.c: Not an MSDOS system if GO32
	is defined, in the sense that the run-time environment
	is thus more UNIX-like.

Wed Sep 20 02:24:51 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* libF77/Makefile.in, libI77/Makefile.in: Comment out `ld -r -x'
	and `mv' line pairs, since `-x' isn't supported on systems
	such as Solaris, and these lines don't seem to do anything
	useful after all.

Wed Aug 30 15:58:35 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 0.5.16 released.

	* Incorporate changes by AT&T/Bellcore to libf2c through 950829.

Mon Aug 28 12:50:34 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* libF77/Makefile.in, libI77/Makefile.in ($(lib)): Force ar'ing
	and ranlib'ing of libf2c.a, else after rm'ing libf2c.a and
	doing a make, only libI77 or libF77 would be added to
	the newly created archive.
	Also, instead of `$?' list all targets explicitly so all
	objects are updated in libf2c.a even if only one actually
	needs recompiling, for similar reason -- we can't easily tell
	if a given object is really up-to-date in libf2c.a, or even
	present there.

Sun Aug 27 14:54:24 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* libF77/Makefile.in, libI77/Makefile.in: Fix spacing so
	initial tabs are present in all appropriate places.
	Move identical $(AR) commands in if then/else clauses
	to single command preceding if.
	(.c.o, Version[FI].o): Use $@ instead of $* because AIX (RS/6000)
	says $@ means source, not object, basename, and $@ seems to work
	everywhere.

Wed Aug 23 15:44:25 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* libF77/system_.c (system_): Declare as returning `ftnint',
	consistent with signal_, instead of defaulting to `int'.
	Hope dmg@research.att.com agrees, else probably will
	change to whatever he determines is correct (and change
	g77 accordingly).

Thu Aug 17 08:46:17 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* libI77/rsne.c (s_rsne): Call f_init if not already done.

Thu Aug 17 04:35:28 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Incorporate changes by Bellcore to libf2c through 950817.
	And this text is for EMACS: (foo at bar).

Wed Aug 16 17:33:06 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* libF77/Makefile.in, libI77/Makefile.in (CFLAGS): Put -g1
	after configured CFLAGS but before GCC_CFLAGS, so by default
	the libraries are built with minimal debugging information.

Fri Jul 28 10:30:15 1995  Dave Love  <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

	* libI77/open.c (f_open): Call f_init if not already done.

Sat Jul  1 19:31:56 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* libF77/system_.c (system_): Make buff one byte bigger so
	following byte doesn't get overwritten by call with large
	string.

Tue Jun 27 23:28:16 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Incorporate changes by Bellcore to libf2c through 950613.

	* libF77/Version.c (__G77_LIBF77_VERSION__): Add this string
	to track g77 mods to libf2c.

	* libI77/Version.c (__G77_LIBI77_VERSION__): Add this string
	to track g77 mods to libf2c.

	* libI77/rawio.h: #include <rawio.h> only conditionally,
	using macro intended for that purpose.

Fri May 19 11:20:00 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Incorporate change made by d.love,

	* configure: Regenerated.

Wed Apr 26 21:08:57 BST 1995  Dave Love  <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

	* configure.in: Fix quoting problem in atexit check.

Wed Mar 15 12:49:58 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Incorporate changes by Bellcore to libf2c through 950315.

Sun Mar  5 18:54:29 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* README: Tell people not to read lib[fi]77/README.

Wed Feb 15 14:30:58 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Update copyright notice at top of file.

	* f2c.h.in (f2c_i2): Make sure defining this crashes compilations.

	* libI77/Makefile.in (F2C_H): Fix typo in definition of this
	symbol (was FF2C_H=...).

	* README: Remove some obsolete items.
	Add date.

	* TODO: Add date.
