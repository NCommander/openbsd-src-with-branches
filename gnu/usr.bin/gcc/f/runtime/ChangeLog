Sat Mar 30 21:02:03 1996  Dave Love  <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

	* Makefile.in: Eliminate explicit use of
 	{RANLIB,AR}_FOR_TARGET.

Tue Mar 26 23:39:59 1996  Dave Love  <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

	* Makefile.in: Remove hardwired RANLIB and RANLIB_TEST (unnoted
 	change).

Mon Mar 25 21:04:56 1996  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Incorporate changes by Bell Labs to libf2c through 1996-03-23,
	including changes to dmg and netlib email addresses.

Tue Mar 19 13:10:02 1996  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Incorporate changes by AT&T/Bellcore to libf2c through 1996-03-19.

	* Makefile.in (rebuilt): New target.

	* lib[FI]77/Makefile.in: Use $AR_FOR_TARGET, not $AR.

Tue Mar 19 12:53:19 1996  Dave Love  <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

	* configure.in (ac_cpp): #include <stdio.h> instead
	of <features.h>.

Tue Mar 19 12:52:09 1996  Mumit Khan  <khan@xraylith.wisc.edu>

	* configure.in (ac_cpp): For f2c integer type,
	add -I$srcdir/../.. to make it work on mips-ultrix4.2.

Sat Mar  9 17:37:15 1996  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* libI77/Makefile.in (.c.o): Add -DAllow_TYQUAD, to enable
	I/O support for INTEGER*8.
	* f2c.h.in: Turn on longint type.

Fri Dec 29 18:22:01 1995  Craig Burley  <burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Reorganize the *clean rules to more closely
	parallel gcc's.

	* lib[FI]77/Makefile.in: Ignore error from $(AR) command,
	in case just doing an install and installer has no write
	access to library (this is a kludge fix -- perhaps install
	targets should never try updating anything?).

Sat Nov 18 19:37:22 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 0.5.17 released.

Thu Nov 16 07:20:35 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Incorporate changes by AT&T/Bellcore to libf2c through 1995-11-15.

Fri Sep 22 02:19:59 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* libI77/backspace.c, libI77/close.c, libI77/endfile.c,
	libI77/fio.h, libI77/inquire.c, libI77/rawio.h,
	libF77/s_paus.c: Not an MSDOS system if GO32
	is defined, in the sense that the run-time environment
	is thus more UNIX-like.

Wed Sep 20 02:24:51 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* libF77/Makefile.in, libI77/Makefile.in: Comment out `ld -r -x'
	and `mv' line pairs, since `-x' isn't supported on systems
	such as Solaris, and these lines don't seem to do anything
	useful after all.

Wed Aug 30 15:58:35 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 0.5.16 released.

	* Incorporate changes by AT&T/Bellcore to libf2c through 950829.

Mon Aug 28 12:50:34 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* libF77/Makefile.in, libI77/Makefile.in ($(lib)): Force ar'ing
	and ranlib'ing of libf2c.a, else after rm'ing libf2c.a and
	doing a make, only libI77 or libF77 would be added to
	the newly created archive.
	Also, instead of `$?' list all targets explicitly so all
	objects are updated in libf2c.a even if only one actually
	needs recompiling, for similar reason -- we can't easily tell
	if a given object is really up-to-date in libf2c.a, or even
	present there.

Sun Aug 27 14:54:24 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* libF77/Makefile.in, libI77/Makefile.in: Fix spacing so
	initial tabs are present in all appropriate places.
	Move identical $(AR) commands in if then/else clauses
	to single command preceding if.
	(.c.o, Version[FI].o): Use $@ instead of $* because AIX (RS/6000)
	says $@ means source, not object, basename, and $@ seems to work
	everywhere.

Wed Aug 23 15:44:25 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* libF77/system_.c (system_): Declare as returning `ftnint',
	consistent with signal_, instead of defaulting to `int'.
	Hope dmg@research.att.com agrees, else probably will
	change to whatever he determines is correct (and change
	g77 accordingly).

Thu Aug 17 08:46:17 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* libI77/rsne.c (s_rsne): Call f_init if not already done.

Thu Aug 17 04:35:28 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Incorporate changes by Bellcore to libf2c through 950817.
	And this text is for EMACS: (foo at bar).

Wed Aug 16 17:33:06 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* libF77/Makefile.in, libI77/Makefile.in (CFLAGS): Put -g1
	after configured CFLAGS but before GCC_CFLAGS, so by default
	the libraries are built with minimal debugging information.

Fri Jul 28 10:30:15 1995  Dave Love  <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

	* libI77/open.c (f_open): Call f_init if not already done.

Sat Jul  1 19:31:56 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* libF77/system_.c (system_): Make buff one byte bigger so
	following byte doesn't get overwritten by call with large
	string.

Tue Jun 27 23:28:16 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Incorporate changes by Bellcore to libf2c through 950613.

	* libF77/Version.c (__G77_LIBF77_VERSION__): Add this string
	to track g77 mods to libf2c.

	* libI77/Version.c (__G77_LIBI77_VERSION__): Add this string
	to track g77 mods to libf2c.

	* libI77/rawio.h: #include <rawio.h> only conditionally,
	using macro intended for that purpose.

Fri May 19 11:20:00 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Incorporate change made by d.love,

Wed Feb 15 14:30:58 1995  Craig Burley  (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in: Update copyright notice at top of file.

	* f2c.h.in (f2c_i2): Make sure defining this crashes compilations.

	* libI77/Makefile.in (F2C_H): Fix typo in definition of this
