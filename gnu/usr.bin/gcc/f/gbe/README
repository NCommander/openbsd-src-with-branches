This directory contains .diff files for various GNU CC distributions.
The name of a file tells which version to which it applies.  Prior to
gcc version 2.7.1, g77 will not build without the appropriate .diff
file applied to the GNU CC distribution via patch.  That is because
g77 needs certain changes to be made to the GNU CC back end, which
it shares with not only the C front end, but with other GNU front
ends (C++, Objective-C, Pascal, ADA, Chill, ...) as well.  Version
2.7.1 of gcc includes the changes needed by g77 versions through 0.5.17.
Future versions of g77 might again require changes to versions 2.7.1,
and later versions, of gcc.

This distribution of g77 is not supported for versions of gcc prior
to 2.6.2.  The 2.6.3 patch file should work for version 2.6.2, but
you should probably use gcc-2.6.3 in any case if that is possible.

To apply a .diff file to, say, gcc 2.7.0, one might use the following
command:

    patch -p1 -d gcc-2.7.0 < gcc-2.7.0/f/gbe/2.7.0.diff

If you are using a version of gcc more recent than the most
recent .diff file's version, try the most recent .diff ONLY
if the difference is in the third field.  E.g. the above
patch might work on gcc-2.6.4 or gcc-2.6.5 if these were
released.  On the other hand, it probably wouldn't work for
a more major release like gcc-2.7.0 or gcc-3.0.0, and you
shouldn't try it.  If the .diff file is missing, don't bother
asking `fortran@gnu.ai.mit.edu' for it -- it is certainly
being worked on.  In the meantime, watch the usual channels
(see gcc/f/DOC *TROUBLE (BUGS, ETC.)*) for information on
support for the new version of gcc.
