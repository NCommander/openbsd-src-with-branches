# This disables the long/short jump optimization.
# I use sysV68 R3V7.1 RM04 (phdm@info.ucl.ac.be)
# Since ss-950318, with jump optimization enabled, "as" issues a warning
# when assembling combine.s :
#   aline nnnnn : Warning: Table overflow: some optimizations lost (SDIs)
# but later "ld" complains with
#   ld: relocation entry found for non-relocatable symbol in combine.o
# and the produced "cc1" fails with SIGSEGV
# Another possible fix would be to split combine.c.
# Since ss-961013, the same happens for expr.c compiled by gcc, but not by cc;
# and for cp/decl.c; aren't those files too big ?
