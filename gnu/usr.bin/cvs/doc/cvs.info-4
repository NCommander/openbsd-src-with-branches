Informing others about commits
==============================

   It is often useful to inform others when you commit a new revision
of a file.  The `-i' option of the `modules' file, or the `loginfo'
file, can be used to automate this process.  *Note modules::.  *Note
loginfo::.  You can use these features of CVS to, for instance,
instruct CVS to mail a message to all developers, or post a message to
a local newsgroup.

Several developers simultaneously attempting to run CVS
=======================================================

   If several developers try to run CVS at the same time, one may get
the following message:

     [11:43:23] waiting for bach's lock in /usr/local/cvsroot/foo

   CVS will try again every 30 seconds, and either continue with the
operation or print the message again, if it still needs to wait.  If a
lock seems to stick around for an undue amount of time, find the person
holding the lock and ask them about the cvs command they are running.
If they aren't running a cvs command, look in the repository directory
mentioned in the message and remove files which they own whose names
start with `#cvs.tfl', `#cvs.rfl', or `#cvs.wfl'.

   Note that these locks are to protect CVS's internal data structures
and have no relationship to the word "lock" in the sense used by
RCS--which refers to reserved checkouts (*note Multiple developers::.).

   Any number of people can be reading from a given repository at a
time; only when someone is writing do the locks prevent other people
from reading or writing.

   One might hope for the following property

     If someone commits some changes in one cvs command,
     then an update by someone else will either get all the
     changes, or none of them.

   but CVS does *not* have this property.  For example, given the files

     a/one.c
     a/two.c
     b/three.c
     b/four.c

   if someone runs

     cvs ci a/two.c b/three.c

   and someone else runs `cvs update' at the same time, the person
running `update' might get only the change to `b/three.c' and not the
change to `a/two.c'.

Mechanisms to track who is editing files
========================================

   For many groups, use of CVS in its default mode is perfectly
satisfactory.  Users may sometimes go to check in a modification only
to find that another modification has intervened, but they deal with it
and proceed with their check in.  Other groups prefer to be able to
know who is editing what files, so that if two people try to edit the
same file they can choose to talk about who is doing what when rather
than be surprised at check in time.  The features in this section allow
such coordination, while retaining the ability of two developers to
edit the same file at the same time.

   For maximum benefit developers should use `cvs edit' (not `chmod')
to make files read-write to edit them, and `cvs release' (not `rm') to
discard a working directory which is no longer in use, but CVS is not
able to enforce this behavior.

File: cvs.info,  Node: Setting a watch,  Next: Getting Notified,  Up: Watches

Telling CVS to watch certain files
----------------------------------

   To enable the watch features, you first specify that certain files
are to be watched.

 - Command: cvs watch on [`-lR'] FILES ...
     Specify that developers should run `cvs edit' before editing
     FILES.  CVS will create working copies of FILES read-only, to
     remind developers to run the `cvs edit' command before working on
     them.

     If FILES includes the name of a directory, CVS arranges to watch
     all files added to the corresponding repository directory, and
     sets a default for files added in the future; this allows the user
     to set notification policies on a per-directory basis.  The
     contents of the directory are processed recursively, unless the
     `-l' option is given.  The `-R' option can be used to force
     recursion if the `-l' option is set in `~/.cvsrc' (*note
     ~/.cvsrc::.).

     If FILES is omitted, it defaults to the current directory.


 - Command: cvs watch off [`-lR'] FILES ...
     Do not provide notification about work on FILES.  CVS will create
     working copies of FILES read-write.

     The FILES and options are processed as for `cvs watch on'.



File: cvs.info,  Node: Getting Notified,  Next: Editing files,  Prev: Setting a watch,  Up: Watches

Telling CVS to notify you
-------------------------

   You can tell CVS that you want to receive notifications about
various actions taken on a file.  You can do this without using `cvs
watch on' for the file, but generally you will want to use `cvs watch
on', so that developers use the `cvs edit' command.

 - Command: cvs watch add [`-a' ACTION] [`-lR'] FILES ...
     Add the current user to the list of people to receive notification
     of work done on FILES.

     The `-a' option specifies what kinds of events CVS should notify
     the user about.  ACTION is one of the following:

    `edit'
          Another user has applied the `cvs edit' command (described
          below) to a file.

    `unedit'
          Another user has applied the `cvs unedit' command (described
          below) or the `cvs release' command to a file, or has deleted
          the file and allowed `cvs update' to recreate it.

    `commit'
          Another user has committed changes to a file.

    `all'
          All of the above.

    `none'
          None of the above.  (This is useful with `cvs edit',
          described below.)

     The `-a' option may appear more than once, or not at all.  If
     omitted, the action defaults to `all'.

     The FILES and options are processed as for the `cvs watch'
     commands.


 - Command: cvs watch remove [`-a' ACTION] [`-lR'] FILES ...
     Remove a notification request established using `cvs watch add';
     the arguments are the same.  If the `-a' option is present, only
     watches for the specified actions are removed.


   When the conditions exist for notification, CVS calls the `notify'
administrative file.  Edit `notify' as one edits the other
administrative files (*note Intro administrative files::.).  This file
follows the usual conventions for administrative files (*note
syntax::.), where each line is a regular expression followed by a
command to execute.  The command should contain a single ocurrence of
`%s' which will be replaced by the user to notify; the rest of the
information regarding the notification will be supplied to the command
on standard input.  The standard thing to put in the `notify' file is
the single line:

     ALL mail %s -s \"CVS notification\"

   This causes users to be notified by electronic mail.

   Note that if you set this up in the straightforward way, users
receive notifications on the server machine.  One could of course write
a `notify' script which directed notifications elsewhere, but to make
this easy, CVS allows you to associate a notification address for each
user.  To do so create a file `users' in `CVSROOT' with a line for each
user in the format USER:VALUE.  Then instead of passing the name of the
user to be notified to `notify', CVS will pass the VALUE (normally an
email address on some other machine).

   CVS does not notify you for your own changes.  Currently this check
is done based on whether the user name of the person taking the action
which triggers notification matches the user name of the person getting
notification.  In fact, in general, the watches features only track one
edit by each user.  It probably would be more useful if watches tracked
each working directory separately, so this behavior might be worth
changing.


File: cvs.info,  Node: Editing files,  Next: Watch information,  Prev: Getting Notified,  Up: Watches

How to edit a file which is being watched
-----------------------------------------

   Since a file which is being watched is checked out read-only, you
cannot simply edit it.  To make it read-write, and inform others that
you are planning to edit it, use the `cvs edit' command.  Some systems
call this a "checkout", but CVS uses that term for obtaining a copy of
the sources (*note Getting the source::.), an operation which those
systems call a "get" or a "fetch".

 - Command: cvs edit [OPTIONS] FILES ...
     Prepare to edit the working files FILES.  CVS makes the FILES
     read-write, and notifies users who have requested `edit'
     notification for any of FILES.

     The `cvs edit' command accepts the same OPTIONS as the `cvs watch
     add' command, and establishes a temporary watch for the user on
     FILES; CVS will remove the watch when FILES are `unedit'ed or
     `commit'ted.  If the user does not wish to receive notifications,
     she should specify `-a none'.

     The FILES and options are processed as for the `cvs watch'
     commands.


   Normally when you are done with a set of changes, you use the `cvs
commit' command, which checks in your changes and returns the watched
files to their usual read-only state.  But if you instead decide to
abandon your changes, or not to make any changes, you can use the `cvs
unedit' command.

 - Command: cvs unedit [`-lR'] FILES ...
     Abandon work on the working files FILES, and revert them to the
     repository versions on which they are based.  CVS makes those
     FILES read-only for which users have requested notification using
     `cvs watch on'.  CVS notifies users who have requested `unedit'
     notification for any of FILES.

     The FILES and options are processed as for the `cvs watch'
     commands.

     If watches are not in use, the `unedit' command probably does not
     work, and the way to revert to the repository version is to remove
     the file and then use `cvs update' to get a new copy.  The meaning
     is not precisely the same; removing and updating may also bring in
     some changes which have been made in the repository since the last
     time you updated.

   When using client/server CVS, you can use the `cvs edit' and `cvs
unedit' commands even if CVS is unable to succesfully communicate with
the server; the notifications will be sent upon the next successful CVS
command.

Information about who is watching and editing
---------------------------------------------

 - Command: cvs watchers [`-lR'] FILES ...
     List the users currently watching changes to FILES.  The report
     includes the files being watched, and the mail address of each
     watcher.

     The FILES and options are processed as for the `cvs watch'
     commands.


 - Command: cvs editors [`-lR'] FILES ...
     List the users currently working on FILES.  The report includes
     the mail address of each user, the time when the user began
     working with the file, and the host and path of the working
     directory containing the file.

     The FILES and options are processed as for the `cvs watch'
     commands.



File: cvs.info,  Node: Watches Compatibility,  Prev: Watch information,  Up: Watches

Using watches with old versions of CVS
--------------------------------------

   If you use the watch features on a repository, it creates `CVS'
directories in the repository and stores the information about watches
in that directory.  If you attempt to use CVS 1.6 or earlier with the
repository, you get an error message such as the following (all on one
line):

     cvs update: cannot open CVS/Entries for reading:
     No such file or directory

   and your operation will likely be aborted.  To use the watch
features, you must upgrade all copies of CVS which use that repository
in local or server mode.  If you cannot upgrade, use the `watch off' and
`watch remove' commands to remove all watches, and that will restore
the repository to a state which CVS 1.6 can cope with.

Choosing between reserved or unreserved checkouts
=================================================

   Reserved and unreserved checkouts each have pros and cons.  Let it
be said that a lot of this is a matter of opinion or what works given
different groups' working styles, but here is a brief description of
some of the issues.  There are many ways to organize a team of
developers.  CVS does not try to enforce a certain organization.  It is
a tool that can be used in several ways.

   Reserved checkouts can be very counter-productive.  If two persons
want to edit different parts of a file, there may be no reason to
prevent either of them from doing so.  Also, it is common for someone
to take out a lock on a file, because they are planning to edit it, but
then forget to release the lock.

   People, especially people who are familiar with reserved checkouts,
often wonder how often conflicts occur if unreserved checkouts are
used, and how difficult they are to resolve.  The experience with many
groups is that they occur rarely and usually are relatively
straightforward to resolve.

   The rarity of serious conflicts may be surprising, until one realizes
that they occur only when two developers disagree on the proper design
for a given section of code; such a disagreement suggests that the team
has not been communicating properly in the first place.  In order to
collaborate under *any* source management regimen, developers must
agree on the general design of the system; given this agreement,
overlapping changes are usually straightforward to merge.

   In some cases unreserved checkouts are clearly inappropriate.  If no
merge tool exists for the kind of file you are managing (for example
word processor files or files edited by Computer Aided Design
programs), and it is not desirable to change to a program which uses a
mergeable data format, then resolving conflicts is going to be
unpleasant enough that you generally will be better off to simply avoid
the conflicts instead, by using reserved checkouts.

   The watches features described above in *Note Watches:: can be
considered to be an intermediate model between reserved checkouts and
unreserved checkouts.  When you go to edit a file, it is possible to
find out who else is editing it.  And rather than having the system
simply forbid both people editing the file, it can tell you what the
situation is and let you figure out whether it is a problem in that
particular case or not.  Therefore, for some groups it can be
considered the best of both the reserved checkout and unreserved
checkout worlds.

Revision management
*******************

   If you have read this far, you probably have a pretty good grasp on
what CVS can do for you.  This chapter talks a little about things that
you still have to decide.

   If you are doing development on your own using CVS you could
probably skip this chapter.  The questions this chapter takes up become
more important when more than one person is working in a repository.

* Menu:

* When to commit::              Some discussion on the subject


File: cvs.info,  Node: When to commit,  Up: Revision management

When to commit?
===============

   Your group should decide which policy to use regarding commits.
Several policies are possible, and as your experience with CVS grows
you will probably find out what works for you.

   If you commit files too quickly you might commit files that do not
even compile.  If your partner updates his working sources to include
your buggy file, he will be unable to compile the code.  On the other
hand, other persons will not be able to benefit from the improvements
you make to the code if you commit very seldom, and conflicts will
probably be more common.

   It is common to only commit files after making sure that they can be
compiled.  Some sites require that the files pass a test suite.
Policies like this can be enforced using the commitinfo file (*note
commitinfo::.), but you should think twice before you enforce such a
convention.  By making the development environment too controlled it
might become too regimented and thus counter-productive to the real
goal, which is to get software written.


File: cvs.info,  Node: Keyword substitution,  Next: Tracking sources,  Prev: Revision management,  Up: Top

Keyword substitution
********************

   As long as you edit source files inside your working copy of a
module you can always find out the state of your files via `cvs status'
and `cvs log'.  But as soon as you export the files from your
development environment it becomes harder to identify which revisions
they are.

   CVS can use a mechanism known as "keyword substitution" (or "keyword
expansion") to help identifying the files.  Embedded strings of the form
`$KEYWORD$' and `$KEYWORD:...$' in a file are replaced with strings of
the form `$KEYWORD:VALUE$' whenever you obtain a new revision of the
file.

File: cvs.info,  Node: Keyword list,  Next: Using keywords,  Up: Keyword substitution

Keyword List
============

   This is a list of the keywords:

`$Author$'
     The login name of the user who checked in the revision.

`$Date$'
     The date and time (UTC) the revision was checked in.

`$Header$'
     A standard header containing the full pathname of the RCS file,
     the revision number, the date (UTC), the author, the state, and
     the locker (if locked).  Files will normally never be locked when
     you use CVS.

`$Id$'
     Same as `$Header$', except that the RCS filename is without a path.

`$Name$'
     Tag name used to check out this file.

`$Locker$'
     The login name of the user who locked the revision (empty if not
     locked, and thus almost always useless when you are using CVS).

`$Log$'
     The log message supplied during commit, preceded by a header
     containing the RCS filename, the revision number, the author, and
     the date (UTC).  Existing log messages are *not* replaced.
     Instead, the new log message is inserted after `$Log:...$'.  Each
     new line is prefixed with the same string which precedes the
     `$Log' keyword.  For example, if the file contains

            /* Here is what people have been up to:
             *
             * $Log: frob.c,v $
             * Revision 1.1  1997/01/03 14:23:51  joe
             * Add the superfrobnicate option
             *
             */

     then additional lines which are added when expanding the `$Log'
     keyword will be preceded by `   * '.  Unlike previous versions of
     CVS and RCS, the "comment leader" from the RCS file is not used.
     The `$Log' keyword is useful for accumulating a complete change
     log in a source file, but for several reasons it can be
     problematic.  *Note Log keyword::.

`$RCSfile$'
     The name of the RCS file without a path.

`$Revision$'
     The revision number assigned to the revision.

`$Source$'
     The full pathname of the RCS file.

`$State$'
     The state assigned to the revision.  States can be assigned with
     `cvs admin -s'--see *Note admin options::.


File: cvs.info,  Node: Using keywords,  Next: Avoiding substitution,  Prev: Keyword list,  Up: Keyword substitution

Using keywords
==============

   To include a keyword string you simply include the relevant text
string, such as `$Id$', inside the file, and commit the file.  CVS will
automatically expand the string as part of the commit operation.

   It is common to embed `$Id$' string in the C source code.  This
example shows the first few lines of a typical file, after keyword
substitution has been performed:

     static char *rcsid="$Id: samp.c,v 1.5 1993/10/19 14:57:32 ceder Exp $";
     /* The following lines will prevent `gcc' version 2.X
        from issuing an "unused variable" warning. */
     #if __GNUC__ == 2
     #define USE(var) static void * use_##var = (&use_##var, (void *) &var)
     USE (rcsid);
     #endif

   Even though a clever optimizing compiler could remove the unused
variable `rcsid', most compilers tend to include the string in the
binary.  Some compilers have a `#pragma' directive to include literal
text in the binary.

   The `ident' command (which is part of the RCS package) can be used
to extract keywords and their values from a file.  This can be handy
for text files, but it is even more useful for extracting keywords from
binary files.

     $ ident samp.c
     samp.c:
          $Id: samp.c,v 1.5 1993/10/19 14:57:32 ceder Exp $
     $ gcc samp.c
     $ ident a.out
     a.out:
          $Id: samp.c,v 1.5 1993/10/19 14:57:32 ceder Exp $

   SCCS is another popular revision control system.  It has a command,
`what', which is very similar to `ident' and used for the same purpose.
Many sites without RCS have SCCS.  Since `what' looks for the
character sequence `@(#)' it is easy to include keywords that are
detected by either command.  Simply prefix the RCS keyword with the
magic SCCS phrase, like this:

     static char *id="@(#) $Id: ab.c,v 1.5 1993/10/19 14:57:32 ceder Exp $";


File: cvs.info,  Node: Avoiding substitution,  Next: Substitution modes,  Prev: Using keywords,  Up: Keyword substitution

Avoiding substitution
=====================

   Keyword substitution has its disadvantages.  Sometimes you might
want the literal text string `$Author$' to appear inside a file without
CVS interpreting it as a keyword and expanding it into something like
`$Author: ceder $'.

   There is unfortunately no way to selectively turn off keyword
substitution.  You can use `-ko' (*note Substitution modes::.) to turn
off keyword substitution entirely.

   In many cases you can avoid using keywords in the source, even
though they appear in the final product.  For example, the source for
this manual contains `$@asis{}Author$' whenever the text `$Author$'
should appear.  In `nroff' and `troff' you can embed the null-character
`\&' inside the keyword for a similar effect.


File: cvs.info,  Node: Substitution modes,  Next: Log keyword,  Prev: Avoiding substitution,  Up: Keyword substitution

Substitution modes
==================

   Each file has a stored default substitution mode, and each working
directory copy of a file also has a substitution mode.  The former is
set by the `-k' option to `cvs add' and `cvs admin'; the latter is set
by the `-k' or `-A' options to `cvs checkout' or `cvs update'.  `cvs
diff' also has a `-k' option.  For some examples, see *Note Binary
files::.

   The modes available are:

`-kkv'
     Generate keyword strings using the default form, e.g.  `$Revision:
     5.7 $' for the `Revision' keyword.

`-kkvl'
     Like `-kkv', except that a locker's name is always inserted if the
     given revision is currently locked.  This option is normally not
     useful when CVS is used.

`-kk'
     Generate only keyword names in keyword strings; omit their values.
     For example, for the `Revision' keyword, generate the string
     `$Revision$' instead of `$Revision: 5.7 $'.  This option is useful
     to ignore differences due to keyword substitution when comparing
     different revisions of a file.

`-ko'
     Generate the old keyword string, present in the working file just
     before it was checked in.  For example, for the `Revision'
     keyword, generate the string `$Revision: 1.1 $' instead of
     `$Revision: 5.7 $' if that is how the string appeared when the
     file was checked in.

`-kb'
     Like `-ko', but also inhibit conversion of line endings between
     the canonical form in which they are stored in the repository
     (linefeed only), and the form appropriate to the operating system
     in use on the client.  For systems, like unix, which use linefeed
     only to terminate lines, this is the same as `-ko'.  For more
     information on binary files, see *Note Binary files::.

`-kv'
     Generate only keyword values for keyword strings.  For example,
     for the `Revision' keyword, generate the string `5.7' instead of
     `$Revision: 5.7 $'.  This can help generate files in programming
     languages where it is hard to strip keyword delimiters like
     `$Revision: $' from a string.  However, further keyword
     substitution cannot be performed once the keyword names are
     removed, so this option should be used with care.

     One often would like to use `-kv' with `cvs export'--*note
     export::..  But be aware that doesn't handle an export containing
     binary files correctly.


File: cvs.info,  Node: Log keyword,  Prev: Substitution modes,  Up: Keyword substitution

Problems with the $Log$ keyword.
================================

   The `$Log$' keyword is somewhat controversial.  As long as you are
working on your development system the information is easily accessible
even if you do not use the `$Log$' keyword--just do a `cvs log'.  Once
you export the file the history information might be useless anyhow.

   A more serious concern is that CVS is not good at handling `$Log$'
entries when a branch is merged onto the main trunk.  Conflicts often
result from the merging operation.

   People also tend to "fix" the log entries in the file (correcting
spelling mistakes and maybe even factual errors).  If that is done the
information from `cvs log' will not be consistent with the information
inside the file.  This may or may not be a problem in real life.

   It has been suggested that the `$Log$' keyword should be inserted
*last* in the file, and not in the files header, if it is to be used at
all.  That way the long list of change messages will not interfere with
everyday source file browsing.

Tracking third-party sources
****************************

   If you modify a program to better fit your site, you probably want
to include your modifications when the next release of the program
arrives.  CVS can help you with this task.

   In the terminology used in CVS, the supplier of the program is
called a "vendor".  The unmodified distribution from the vendor is
checked in on its own branch, the "vendor branch".  CVS reserves branch
1.1.1 for this use.

   When you modify the source and commit it, your revision will end up
on the main trunk.  When a new release is made by the vendor, you
commit it on the vendor branch and copy the modifications onto the main
trunk.

   Use the `import' command to create and update the vendor branch.
After a successful `import' the vendor branch is made the `head'
revision, so anyone that checks out a copy of the file gets that
revision.  When a local modification is committed it is placed on the
main trunk, and made the `head' revision.

Importing a module for the first time
=====================================

   Use the `import' command to check in the sources for the first time.
When you use the `import' command to track third-party sources, the
"vendor tag" and "release tags" are useful.  The "vendor tag" is a
symbolic name for the branch (which is always 1.1.1, unless you use the
`-b BRANCH' flag--*Note Multiple vendor branches::.).  The "release
tags" are symbolic names for a particular release, such as `FSF_0_04'.

   Note that `import' does *not* change the directory in which you
invoke it.  In particular, it does not set up that directory as a CVS
working directory; if you want to work with the sources import them
first and then check them out into a different directory (*note Getting
the source::.).

   Suppose you have the sources to a program called `wdiff' in a
directory `wdiff-0.04', and are going to make private modifications
that you want to be able to use even when new releases are made in the
future.  You start by importing the source to your repository:

     $ cd wdiff-0.04
     $ cvs import -m "Import of FSF v. 0.04" fsf/wdiff FSF_DIST WDIFF_0_04

   The vendor tag is named `FSF_DIST' in the above example, and the
only release tag assigned is `WDIFF_0_04'.


File: cvs.info,  Node: Update imports,  Next: Reverting local changes,  Prev: First import,  Up: Tracking sources

Updating a module with the import command
=========================================

   When a new release of the source arrives, you import it into the
repository with the same `import' command that you used to set up the
repository in the first place.  The only difference is that you specify
a different release tag this time.

     $ tar xfz wdiff-0.05.tar.gz
     $ cd wdiff-0.05
     $ cvs import -m "Import of FSF v. 0.05" fsf/wdiff FSF_DIST WDIFF_0_05

   For files that have not been modified locally, the newly created
revision becomes the head revision.  If you have made local changes,
`import' will warn you that you must merge the changes into the main
trunk, and tell you to use `checkout -j' to do so.

     $ cvs checkout -jFSF_DIST:yesterday -jFSF_DIST wdiff

The above command will check out the latest revision of `wdiff',
merging the changes made on the vendor branch `FSF_DIST' since
yesterday into the working copy.  If any conflicts arise during the
merge they should be resolved in the normal way (*note Conflicts
example::.).  Then, the modified files may be committed.

   Using a date, as suggested above, assumes that you do not import
more than one release of a product per day. If you do, you can always
use something like this instead:

     $ cvs checkout -jWDIFF_0_04 -jWDIFF_0_05 wdiff

In this case, the two above commands are equivalent.


File: cvs.info,  Node: Reverting local changes,  Next: Binary files in imports,  Prev: Update imports,  Up: Tracking sources

Reverting to the latest vendor release
======================================

   You can also revert local changes completely and return to the
latest vendor release by changing the `head' revision back to the
vendor branch on all files.  For example, if you have a checked-out
copy of the sources in `~/work.d/wdiff', and you want to revert to the
vendor's version for all the files in that directory, you would type:

     $ cd ~/work.d/wdiff
     $ cvs admin -bWDIFF .

You must specify the `-bWDIFF' without any space after the `-b'.  *Note
admin options::.

How to handle binary files with cvs import
==========================================

   Use the `-k' wrapper option to tell import which files are binary.
*Note Wrappers::.


File: cvs.info,  Node: Keywords in imports,  Next: Multiple vendor branches,  Prev: Binary files in imports,  Up: Tracking sources

How to handle keyword substitution with cvs import
==================================================

   The sources which you are importing may contain keywords (*note
Keyword substitution::.).  For example, the vendor may use CVS or some
other system which uses similar keyword expansion syntax.  If you just
import the files in the default fashion, then the keyword expansions
supplied by the vendor will be replaced by keyword expansions supplied
by your own copy of CVS.  It may be more convenient to maintain the
expansions supplied by the vendor, so that this information can supply
information about the sources that you imported from the vendor.

   To maintain the keyword expansions supplied by the vendor, supply
the `-ko' option to `cvs import' the first time you import the file.
This will turn off keyword expansion for that file entirely, so if you
want to be more selective you'll have to think about what you want and
use the `-k' option to `cvs update' or `cvs admin' as appropriate.


File: cvs.info,  Node: Multiple vendor branches,  Prev: Keywords in imports,  Up: Tracking sources

Multiple vendor branches
========================

   All the examples so far assume that there is only one vendor from
which you are getting sources.  In some situations you might get
sources from a variety of places.  For example, suppose that you are
dealing with a project where many different people and teams are
modifying the software.  There are a variety of ways to handle this,
but in some cases you have a bunch of source trees lying around and
what you want to do more than anything else is just to all put them in
CVS so that you at least have them in one place.

   For handling situations in which there may be more than one vendor,
you may specify the `-b' option to `cvs import'.  It takes as an
argument the vendor branch to import to.  The default is `-b 1.1.1'.

   For example, suppose that there are two teams, the red team and the
blue team, that are sending you sources.  You want to import the red
team's efforts to branch 1.1.1 and use the vendor tag RED.  You want to
import the blue team's efforts to branch 1.1.3 and use the vendor tag
BLUE.  So the commands you might use are:

     $ cvs import dir RED RED_1-0
     $ cvs import -b 1.1.3 dir BLUE BLUE_1-5

   Note that if your vendor tag does not match your `-b' option, CVS
will not detect this case!  For example,

     $ cvs import -b 1.1.3 dir RED RED_1-0

Be careful; this kind of mismatch is sure to sow confusion or worse.  I
can't think of a useful purpose for the ability to specify a mismatch
here, but if you discover such a use, don't.  CVS is likely to make this
an error in some future release.

How your build system interacts with CVS
****************************************

   As mentioned in the introduction, CVS does not contain software for
building your software from source code.  This section describes how
various aspects of your build system might interact with CVS.

   One common question, especially from people who are accustomed to
RCS, is how to make their build get an up to date copy of the sources.
The answer to this with CVS is two-fold.  First of all, since CVS
itself can recurse through directories, there is no need to modify your
`Makefile' (or whatever configuration file your build tool uses) to
make sure each file is up to date.  Instead, just use two commands,
first `cvs -q update' and then `make' or whatever the command is to
invoke your build tool.  Secondly, you do not necessarily *want* to get
a copy of a change someone else made until you have finished your own
work.  One suggested approach is to first update your sources, then
implement, build and test the change you were thinking of, and then
commit your sources (updating first if necessary).  By periodically (in
between changes, using the approach just described) updating your
entire tree, you ensure that your sources are sufficiently up to date.

   One common need is to record which versions of which source files
went into a particular build.  This kind of functionality is sometimes
called "bill of materials" or something similar.  The best way to do
this with CVS is to use the `tag' command to record which versions went
into a given build (*note Tags::.).

   Using CVS in the most straightforward manner possible, each
developer will have a copy of the entire source tree which is used in a
particular build.  If the source tree is small, or if developers are
geographically dispersed, this is the preferred solution.  In fact one
approach for larger projects is to break a project down into smaller
separately-compiled subsystems, and arrange a way of releasing them
internally so that each developer need check out only those subsystems
which are they are actively working on.

   Another approach is to set up a structure which allows developers to
have their own copies of some files, and for other files to access
source files from a central location.  Many people have come up with
some such a system using features such as the symbolic link feature
found in many operating systems, or the `VPATH' feature found in many
versions of `make'.  One build tool which is designed to help with this
kind of thing is Odin (see
`ftp://ftp.cs.colorado.edu/pub/distribs/odin').

Overall structure of CVS commands
=================================

   The overall format of all CVS commands is:

     cvs [ cvs_options ] cvs_command [ command_options ] [ command_args ]

`cvs'
     The name of the CVS program.

`cvs_options'
     Some options that affect all sub-commands of CVS.  These are
     described below.

`cvs_command'
     One of several different sub-commands.  Some of the commands have
     aliases that can be used instead; those aliases are noted in the
     reference manual for that command.  There are only two situations
     where you may omit `cvs_command': `cvs -H' elicits a list of
     available commands, and `cvs -v' displays version information on
     CVS itself.

`command_options'
     Options that are specific for the command.

`command_args'
     Arguments to the commands.

   There is unfortunately some confusion between `cvs_options' and
`command_options'.  `-l', when given as a `cvs_option', only affects
some of the commands.  When it is given as a `command_option' is has a
different meaning, and is accepted by more commands.  In other words,
do not take the above categorization too seriously.  Look at the
documentation instead.


File: cvs.info,  Node: Exit status,  Next: ~/.cvsrc,  Prev: Structure,  Up: CVS commands

CVS's exit status
=================

   CVS can indicate to the calling environment whether it succeeded or
failed by setting its "exit status".  The exact way of testing the exit
status will vary from one operating system to another.  For example in
a unix shell script the `$?' variable will be 0 if the last command
returned a successful exit status, or greater than 0 if the exit status
indicated failure.

   If CVS is successful, it returns a successful status; if there is an
error, it prints an error message and returns a failure status.  The
one exception to this is the `cvs diff' command.  It will return a
successful status if it found no differences, or a failure status if
there were differences or if there was an error.  Because this behavior
provides no good way to detect errors, in the future it is possible that
`cvs diff' will be changed to behave like the other CVS commands.


File: cvs.info,  Node: ~/.cvsrc,  Next: Global options,  Prev: Exit status,  Up: CVS commands

Default options and the ~/.cvsrc file
=====================================

   There are some `command_options' that are used so often that you
might have set up an alias or some other means to make sure you always
specify that option.  One example (the one that drove the
implementation of the `.cvsrc' support, actually) is that many people
find the default output of the `diff' command to be very hard to read,
and that either context diffs or unidiffs are much easier to understand.

   The `~/.cvsrc' file is a way that you can add default options to
`cvs_commands' within cvs, instead of relying on aliases or other shell
scripts.

   The format of the `~/.cvsrc' file is simple.  The file is searched
for a line that begins with the same name as the `cvs_command' being
executed.  If a match is found, then the remainder of the line is split
up (at whitespace characters) into separate options and added to the
command arguments *before* any options from the command line.

   If a command has two names (e.g., `checkout' and `co'), the official
name, not necessarily the one used on the command line, will be used to
match against the file.  So if this is the contents of the user's
`~/.cvsrc' file:

     log -N
     diff -u
     update -P
     co -P

the command `cvs checkout foo' would have the `-P' option added to the
arguments, as well as `cvs co foo'.

   With the example file above, the output from `cvs diff foobar' will
be in unidiff format.  `cvs diff -c foobar' will provide context diffs,
as usual.  Getting "old" format diffs would be slightly more
complicated, because `diff' doesn't have an option to specify use of
the "old" format, so you would need `cvs -f diff foobar'.

   In place of the command name you can use `cvs' to specify global
options (*note Global options::.).  For example the following line in
`.cvsrc'

     cvs -z6

   causes CVS to use compression level 6.


File: cvs.info,  Node: Global options,  Next: Common options,  Prev: ~/.cvsrc,  Up: CVS commands

Global options
==============

   The available `cvs_options' (that are given to the left of
`cvs_command') are:

`--allow-root=ROOTDIR'
     Specify legal CVSROOT directory.  See *Note Password
     authentication server::.

`-a'
     Authenticate all communication between the client and the server.
     Only has an effect on the CVS client.  As of this writing, this is
     only implemented when using a GSSAPI connection (*note GSSAPI
     authenticated::.).  Authentication prevents certain sorts of
     attacks involving hijacking the active TCP connection.  Enabling
     authentication does not enable encryption.

`-b BINDIR'
     In CVS 1.9.18 and older, this specified that RCS programs are in
     the BINDIR directory.  Current versions of CVS do not run RCS
     programs; for compatibility this option is accepted, but it does
     nothing.

`-T TEMPDIR'
     Use TEMPDIR as the directory where temporary files are located.
     Overrides the setting of the `$TMPDIR' environment variable and
     any precompiled directory.  This parameter should be specified as
     an absolute pathname.

`-d CVS_ROOT_DIRECTORY'
     Use CVS_ROOT_DIRECTORY as the root directory pathname of the
     repository.  Overrides the setting of the `$CVSROOT' environment
     variable.  *Note Repository::.

`-e EDITOR'
     Use EDITOR to enter revision log information.  Overrides the
     setting of the `$CVSEDITOR' and `$EDITOR' environment variables.
     For more information, see *Note Committing your changes::.

`-f'
     Do not read the `~/.cvsrc' file.  This option is most often used
     because of the non-orthogonality of the CVS option set.  For
     example, the `cvs log' option `-N' (turn off display of tag names)
     does not have a corresponding option to turn the display on.  So
     if you have `-N' in the `~/.cvsrc' entry for `log', you may need
     to use `-f' to show the tag names.

`-H'
`--help'
     Display usage information about the specified `cvs_command' (but
     do not actually execute the command).  If you don't specify a
     command name, `cvs -H' displays overall help for CVS, including a
     list of other help options.

`-l'
     Do not log the `cvs_command' in the command history (but execute it
     anyway).  *Note history::, for information on command history.

`-n'
     Do not change any files.  Attempt to execute the `cvs_command',
     but only to issue reports; do not remove, update, or merge any
     existing files, or create any new files.

     Note that CVS will not necessarily produce exactly the same output
     as without `-n'.  In some cases the output will be the same, but
     in other cases CVS will skip some of the processing that would
     have been required to produce the exact same output.

`-Q'
     Cause the command to be really quiet; the command will only
     generate output for serious problems.

`-q'
     Cause the command to be somewhat quiet; informational messages,
     such as reports of recursion through subdirectories, are
     suppressed.

`-r'
     Make new working files files read-only.  Same effect as if the
     `$CVSREAD' environment variable is set (*note Environment
     variables::.).  The default is to make working files writable,
     unless watches are on (*note Watches::.).

`-s VARIABLE=VALUE'
     Set a user variable (*note Variables::.).

`-t'
     Trace program execution; display messages showing the steps of CVS
     activity.  Particularly useful with `-n' to explore the potential
     impact of an unfamiliar command.

`-v'
`--version'
     Display version and copyright information for CVS.

`-w'
     Make new working files read-write.  Overrides the setting of the
     `$CVSREAD' environment variable.  Files are created read-write by
     default, unless `$CVSREAD' is set or `-r' is given.

`-x'
     Encrypt all communication between the client and the server.  Only
     has an effect on the CVS client.  As of this writing, this is only
     implemented when using a GSSAPI connection (*note GSSAPI
     authenticated::.) or a Kerberos connection (*note Kerberos
     authenticated::.).  Enabling encryption implies that message
     traffic is also authenticated.  Encryption support is not
     available by default; it must be enabled using a special configure
     option, `--enable-encryption', when you build CVS.

`-z GZIP-LEVEL'
     Set the compression level.  Only has an effect on the CVS client.
