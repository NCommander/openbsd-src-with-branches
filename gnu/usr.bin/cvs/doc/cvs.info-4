File: cvs.info,  Node: Substitution modes,  Next: Log keyword,  Prev: Avoiding substitution,  Up: Keyword substitution

Substitution modes
==================

   Each file has a stored default substitution mode, and each working
directory copy of a file also has a substitution mode.  The former is
set by the `-k' option to `cvs add' and `cvs admin'; the latter is set
by the -k or -A options to `cvs checkout' or `cvs update'.  `cvs diff'
also has a `-k' option.  For some examples, *Note Binary files::.

   The modes available are:

`-kkv'
     Generate keyword strings using the default form, e.g.  `$Revision:
     5.7 $' for the `Revision' keyword.

`-kkvl'
     Like `-kkv', except that a locker's name is always inserted if the
     given revision is currently locked.  This option is normally not
     useful when CVS is used.

`-kk'
     Generate only keyword names in keyword strings; omit their values.
     For example, for the `Revision' keyword, generate the string
     `$Revision$' instead of `$Revision: 5.7 $'.  This option is useful
     to ignore differences due to keyword substitution when comparing
     different revisions of a file.

`-ko'
     Generate the old keyword string, present in the working file just
     before it was checked in.  For example, for the `Revision'
     keyword, generate the string `$Revision: 1.1 $' instead of
     `$Revision: 5.7 $' if that is how the string appeared when the
     file was checked in.

`-kb'
     Like `-ko', but also inhibit conversion of line endings between
     the canonical form in which they are stored in the repository
     (linefeed only), and the form appropriate to the operating system
     in use on the client.  For systems, like unix, which use linefeed
     only to terminate lines, this is the same as `-ko'.  For more
     information on binary files, see *Note Binary files::.

`-kv'
     Generate only keyword values for keyword strings.  For example,
     for the `Revision' keyword, generate the string `5.7' instead of
     `$Revision: 5.7 $'.  This can help generate files in programming
     languages where it is hard to strip keyword delimiters like
     `$Revision: $' from a string.  However, further keyword
     substitution cannot be performed once the keyword names are
     removed, so this option should be used with care.

     One often would like to use `-kv' with `cvs export'--*note
     export::..  But be aware that doesn't handle an export containing
     binary files correctly.


File: cvs.info,  Node: Log keyword,  Prev: Substitution modes,  Up: Keyword substitution

Problems with the $Log$ keyword.
================================

   The `$Log$' keyword is somewhat controversial.  As long as you are
working on your development system the information is easily accessible
even if you do not use the `$Log$' keyword--just do a `cvs log'.  Once
you export the file the history information might be useless anyhow.

   A more serious concern is that RCS is not good at handling `$Log$'
entries when a branch is merged onto the main trunk.  Conflicts often
result from the merging operation.

   People also tend to "fix" the log entries in the file (correcting
spelling mistakes and maybe even factual errors).  If that is done the
information from `cvs log' will not be consistent with the information
inside the file.  This may or may not be a problem in real life.

   It has been suggested that the `$Log$' keyword should be inserted
*last* in the file, and not in the files header, if it is to be used at
all.  That way the long list of change messages will not interfere with
everyday source file browsing.

Handling binary files
*********************

   There are two issues with using CVS to store binary files.  The
first is that CVS by default convert line endings between the canonical
form in which they are stored in the repository (linefeed only), and
the form appropriate to the operating system in use on the client (for
example, carriage return followed by line feed for Windows NT).

   The second is that a binary file might happen to contain data which
looks like a keyword (*note Keyword substitution::.), so keyword
expansion must be turned off.

   The `-kb' option available with some CVS commands insures that
neither line ending conversion nor keyword expansion will be done.  If
you are using an old version of RCS without this option, and you are
using an operating system, such as unix, which terminates lines with
linefeeds only, you can use `-ko' instead; if you are on another
operating system, upgrade to a version of RCS, such as 5.7 or later,
which supports `-kb'.

   Here is an example of how you can create a new file using the `-kb'
flag:

     $ echo '$Id$' > kotest
     $ cvs add -kb -m"A test file" kotest
     $ cvs ci -m"First checkin; contains a keyword" kotest

   If a file accidentally gets added without `-kb', one can use the
`cvs admin' command to recover.  For example:

     $ echo '$Id$' > kotest
     $ cvs add -m"A test file" kotest
     $ cvs ci -m"First checkin; contains a keyword" kotest
     $ cvs admin -kb kotest
     $ cvs update -A kotest
     $ cvs commit -m "make it binary" kotest  # For non-unix systems

   When you check in the file `kotest' the keywords are expanded.  (Try
the above example, and do a `cat kotest' after every command).  The `cvs
admin -kb' command sets the default keyword substitution method for
this file, but it does not alter the working copy of the file that you
have.  The easiest way to get the unexpanded version of `kotest' is
`cvs update -A'.  If you need to cope with line endings (that is, you
are using a CVS client on a non-unix system), then you need to check in
a new copy of the file, as shown by the `cvs commit' command above.

   However, in using `cvs admin -k' to change the keyword expansion, be
aware that the keyword expansion mode is not version controlled.  This
means that, for example, that if you have a text file in old releases,
and a binary file with the same name in new releases, CVS provides no
way to check out the file in text or binary mode depending on what
version you are checking out.  There is no good workaround for this
problem.

   You can also set a default for whether `cvs add' and `cvs import'
treat a file as binary based on its name; for example you could say
that files who names end in `.exe' are binary.  *Note Wrappers::.

How your build system interacts with CVS
****************************************

   As mentioned in the introduction, CVS does not contain software for
building your software from source code.  This section describes how
various aspects of your build system might interact with CVS.

   One common question, especially from people who are accustomed to
RCS, is how to make their build get an up to date copy of the sources.
The answer to this with CVS is two-fold.  First of all, since CVS
itself can recurse through directories, there is no need to modify your
`Makefile' (or whatever configuration file your build tool uses) to
make sure each file is up to date.  Instead, just use two commands,
first `cvs -q update' and then `make' or whatever the command is to
invoke your build tool.  Secondly, you do not necessarily *want* to get
a copy of a change someone else made until you have finished your own
work.  One suggested approach is to first update your sources, then
implement, build and test the change you were thinking of, and then
commit your sources (updating first if necessary).  By periodically (in
between changes, using the approach just described) updating your
entire tree, you ensure that your sources are sufficiently up to date.

   One common need is to record which versions of which source files
went into a particular build.  This kind of functionality is sometimes
called "bill of materials" or something similar.  The best way to do
this with CVS is to use the `tag' command to record which versions went
into a given build (*note Tags::.).

   Using CVS in the most straightforward manner possible, each
developer will have a copy of the entire source tree which is used in a
particular build.  If the source tree is small, or if developers are
geographically dispersed, this is the preferred solution.  In fact one
approach for larger projects is to break a project down into smaller
separately-compiled subsystems, and arrange a way of releasing them
internally so that each developer need check out only those subsystems
which are they are actively working on.

   Another approach is to set up a structure which allows developers to
have their own copies of some files, and for other files to access
source files from a central location.  Many people have come up with
some such a system using features such as the symbolic link feature
found in many operating systems, or the `VPATH' feature found in many
versions of `make'.  One build tool which is designed to help with this
kind of thing is Odin (see
`ftp://ftp.cs.colorado.edu/pub/distribs/odin').

Compatibility between CVS Versions
**********************************

   The repository format is compatible going back to CVS 1.3.  But see
*Note Watches Compatibility::, if you have copies of CVS 1.6 or older
and you want to use the optional developer communication features.

   The working directory format is compatible going back to CVS 1.5.
It did change between CVS 1.3 and CVS 1.5.  If you run CVS 1.5 or newer
on a working directory checked out with CVS 1.3, CVS will convert it,
but to go back to CVS 1.3 you need to check out a new working directory
with CVS 1.3.

   The remote protocol is interoperable going back to CVS 1.5, but no
further (1.5 was the first official release with the remote protocol,
but some older versions might still be floating around).  In many cases
you need to upgrade both the client and the server to take advantage of
new features and bugfixes, however.

Revision management
*******************

   If you have read this far, you probably have a pretty good grasp on
what CVS can do for you.  This chapter talks a little about things that
you still have to decide.

   If you are doing development on your own using CVS you could
probably skip this chapter.  The questions this chapter takes up become
more important when more than one person is working in a repository.

* Menu:

* When to commit::              Some discussion on the subject


File: cvs.info,  Node: When to commit,  Up: Revision management

When to commit?
===============

   Your group should decide which policy to use regarding commits.
Several policies are possible, and as your experience with CVS grows
you will probably find out what works for you.

   If you commit files too quickly you might commit files that do not
even compile.  If your partner updates his working sources to include
your buggy file, he will be unable to compile the code.  On the other
hand, other persons will not be able to benefit from the improvements
you make to the code if you commit very seldom, and conflicts will
probably be more common.

   It is common to only commit files after making sure that they can be
compiled.  Some sites require that the files pass a test suite.
Policies like this can be enforced using the commitinfo file (*note
commitinfo::.), but you should think twice before you enforce such a
convention.  By making the development environment too controlled it
might become too regimented and thus counter-productive to the real
goal, which is to get software written.

File: cvs.info,  Node: Structure,  Next: ~/.cvsrc,  Up: CVS commands

Overall structure of CVS commands
=================================

   The overall format of all CVS commands is:

     cvs [ cvs_options ] cvs_command [ command_options ] [ command_args ]

`cvs'
     The name of the CVS program.

`cvs_options'
     Some options that affect all sub-commands of CVS.  These are
     described below.

`cvs_command'
     One of several different sub-commands.  Some of the commands have
     aliases that can be used instead; those aliases are noted in the
     reference manual for that command.  There are only two situations
     where you may omit `cvs_command': `cvs -H' elicits a list of
     available commands, and `cvs -v' displays version information on
     CVS itself.

`command_options'
     Options that are specific for the command.

`command_args'
     Arguments to the commands.

   There is unfortunately some confusion between `cvs_options' and
`command_options'.  `-l', when given as a `cvs_option', only affects
some of the commands.  When it is given as a `command_option' is has a
different meaning, and is accepted by more commands.  In other words,
do not take the above categorization too seriously.  Look at the
documentation instead.


File: cvs.info,  Node: ~/.cvsrc,  Next: Global options,  Prev: Structure,  Up: CVS commands

Default options and the ~/.cvsrc file
=====================================

   There are some `command_options' that are used so often that you
might have set up an alias or some other means to make sure you always
specify that option.  One example (the one that drove the
implementation of the .cvsrc support, actually) is that many people
find the default output of the `diff' command to be very hard to read,
and that either context diffs or unidiffs are much easier to understand.

   The `~/.cvsrc' file is a way that you can add default options to
`cvs_commands' within cvs, instead of relying on aliases or other shell
scripts.

   The format of the `~/.cvsrc' file is simple.  The file is searched
for a line that begins with the same name as the `cvs_command' being
executed.  If a match is found, then the remainder of the line is split
up (at whitespace characters) into separate options and added to the
command arguments *before* any options from the command line.

   If a command has two names (e.g., `checkout' and `co'), the official
name, not necessarily the one used on the command line, will be used to
match against the file.  So if this is the contents of the user's
`~/.cvsrc' file:

     log -N
     diff -u
     update -P
     co -P

the command `cvs checkout foo' would have the `-P' option added to the
arguments, as well as `cvs co foo'.

   With the example file above, the output from `cvs diff foobar' will
be in unidiff format.  `cvs diff -c foobar' will provide context diffs,
as usual.  Getting "old" format diffs would be slightly more
complicated, because `diff' doesn't have an option to specify use of
the "old" format, so you would need `cvs -f diff foobar'.

   In place of the command name you can use `cvs' to specify global
options (*note Global options::.).  For example the following line in
`.cvsrc'

     cvs -z6

   causes CVS to use compression level 6


File: cvs.info,  Node: Global options,  Next: Common options,  Prev: ~/.cvsrc,  Up: CVS commands

Global options
==============

   The available `cvs_options' (that are given to the left of
`cvs_command') are:

`-b BINDIR'
     Use BINDIR as the directory where RCS programs are located.
     Overrides the setting of the `$RCSBIN' environment variable and
     any precompiled directory.  This parameter should be specified as
     an absolute pathname.

`-T TEMPDIR'
     Use TEMPDIR as the directory where temporary files are located.
     Overrides the setting of the `$TMPDIR' environment variable and
     any precompiled directory.  This parameter should be specified as
     an absolute pathname.

`-d CVS_ROOT_DIRECTORY'
     Use CVS_ROOT_DIRECTORY as the root directory pathname of the
     repository.  Overrides the setting of the `$CVSROOT' environment
     variable.  *Note Repository::.

`-e EDITOR'
     Use EDITOR to enter revision log information.  Overrides the
     setting of the `$CVSEDITOR' and `$EDITOR' environment variables.
     For more information, see *Note Committing your changes::.

`-f'
     Do not read the `~/.cvsrc' file.  This option is most often used
     because of the non-orthogonality of the CVS option set.  For
     example, the `cvs log' option `-N' (turn off display of tag names)
     does not have a corresponding option to turn the display on.  So
     if you have `-N' in the `~/.cvsrc' entry for `log', you may need
     to use `-f' to show the tag names.

`-H'
`--help'
     Display usage information about the specified `cvs_command' (but
     do not actually execute the command).  If you don't specify a
     command name, `cvs -H' displays overall help for CVS, including a
     list of other help options.

`-l'
     Do not log the cvs_command in the command history (but execute it
     anyway).  *Note history::, for information on command history.

`-n'
     Do not change any files.  Attempt to execute the `cvs_command',
     but only to issue reports; do not remove, update, or merge any
     existing files, or create any new files.

`-Q'
     Cause the command to be really quiet; the command will only
     generate output for serious problems.

`-q'
     Cause the command to be somewhat quiet; informational messages,
     such as reports of recursion through subdirectories, are
     suppressed.

`-r'
     Make new working files files read-only.  Same effect as if the
     `$CVSREAD' environment variable is set (*note Environment
     variables::.).  The default is to make working files writable,
     unless watches are on (*note Watches::.).

`-s VARIABLE=VALUE'
     Set a user variable (*note Variables::.).

`-t'
     Trace program execution; display messages showing the steps of CVS
     activity.  Particularly useful with `-n' to explore the potential
     impact of an unfamiliar command.

`-v'
`--version'
     Display version and copyright information for CVS.

`-w'
     Make new working files read-write.  Overrides the setting of the
     `$CVSREAD' environment variable.  Files are created read-write by
     default, unless `$CVSREAD' is set or `-r' is given.

`-x'
     Encrypt all communication between the client and the server.  Only
     has an effect on the CVS client.  As of this writing, this is only
     implemented when using a Kerberos connection (*note Kerberos
     authenticated::.).  Encryption support is not available by
     default; it must be enabled using a special configure option,
     `--enable-encryption', when you build CVS.

`-z GZIP-LEVEL'
     Set the compression level.  Only has an effect on the CVS client.


File: cvs.info,  Node: Common options,  Next: admin,  Prev: Global options,  Up: CVS commands

Common command options
======================

   This section describes the `command_options' that are available
across several CVS commands.  These options are always given to the
right of `cvs_command'. Not all commands support all of these options;
each option is only supported for commands where it makes sense.
However, when a command has one of these options you can almost always
count on the same behavior of the option as in other commands.  (Other
command options, which are listed with the individual commands, may have
different behavior from one CVS command to the other).

   *Warning:* the `history' command is an exception; it supports many
options that conflict even with these standard options.

`-D DATE_SPEC'
     Use the most recent revision no later than DATE_SPEC.  DATE_SPEC
     is a single argument, a date description specifying a date in the
     past.

     The specification is "sticky" when you use it to make a private
     copy of a source file; that is, when you get a working file using
     `-D', CVS records the date you specified, so that further updates
     in the same directory will use the same date (for more information
     on sticky tags/dates, *note Sticky tags::.).

     `-D' is available with the `checkout', `diff', `export', `history',
     `rdiff', `rtag', and `update' commands.  (The `history' command
     uses this option in a slightly different way; *note history
     options::.).

     A wide variety of date formats are supported by CVS.  The most
     standard ones are ISO8601 (from the International Standards
     Organization) and the Internet e-mail standard (specified in
     RFC822 as amended by RFC1123).

     ISO8601 dates have many variants but a few examples are:

          1972-09-24
          1972-09-24 20:05

     See `http://www.ft.uni-erlangen.de/~mskuhn/iso-time.html' for more
     details about ISO8601 dates.

     In addition to the dates allowed in Internet e-mail itself, CVS
     also allows some of the fields to be omitted.  For example:

          24 Sep 1972 20:05
          24 Sep

     The date is interpreted as being in the local timezone, unless a
     specific timezone is specified.

     These two date formats are preferred.  However, CVS currently
     accepts a wide variety of other date formats.  They are
     intentionally not documented here in any detail, and future
     versions of CVS might not accept all of them.

     One such format is `MONTH/DAY/YEAR'.  This may confuse people who
     are accustomed to having the month and day in the other order;
     `1/4/96' is January 4, not April 1.

     Remember to quote the argument to the `-D' flag so that your shell
     doesn't interpret spaces as argument separators.  A command using
     the `-D' flag can look like this:

          $ cvs diff -D "1 hour ago" cvs.texinfo

`-f'
     When you specify a particular date or tag to CVS commands, they
     normally ignore files that do not contain the tag (or did not
     exist prior to the date) that you specified.  Use the `-f' option
     if you want files retrieved even when there is no match for the
     tag or date.  (The most recent revision of the file will be used).

     `-f' is available with these commands: `annotate', `checkout',
     `export', `rdiff', `rtag', and `update'.

     *Warning:*  The `commit' command also has a `-f' option, but it
     has a different behavior for that command.  *Note commit options::.

`-k KFLAG'
     Alter the default RCS processing of keywords.  *Note Keyword
     substitution::, for the meaning of KFLAG.  Your KFLAG
     specification is "sticky" when you use it to create a private copy
     of a source file; that is, when you use this option with the
     `checkout' or `update' commands, CVS associates your selected
     KFLAG with the file, and continues to use it with future update
     commands on the same file until you specify otherwise.

     The `-k' option is available with the `add', `checkout', `diff',
     `import' and `update' commands.

`-l'
     Local; run only in current working directory, rather than
     recursing through subdirectories.

     *Warning:* this is not the same as the overall `cvs -l' option,
     which you can specify to the left of a cvs command!

     Available with the following commands: `checkout', `commit',
     `diff', `export', `log', `remove', `rdiff', `rtag', `status',
     `tag', and `update'.

`-m MESSAGE'
     Use MESSAGE as log information, instead of invoking an editor.

     Available with the following commands: `add', `commit' and
     `import'.

`-n'
     Do not run any checkout/commit/tag program.  (A program can be
     specified to run on each of these activities, in the modules
     database (*note modules::.); this option bypasses it).

     *Warning:* this is not the same as the overall `cvs -n' option,
     which you can specify to the left of a cvs command!

     Available with the `checkout', `commit', `export', and `rtag'
     commands.

`-P'
     Prune empty directories.  See *Note Removing directories::.

`-p'
     Pipe the files retrieved from the repository to standard output,
     rather than writing them in the current directory.  Available with
     the `checkout' and `update' commands.

`-W'
     Specify file names that should be filtered.  You can use this
     option repeatedly.  The spec can be a file name pattern of the
     same type that you can specify in the `.cvswrappers' file.
     Avaliable with the following commands: `import', and `update'.

`-r TAG'
     Use the revision specified by the TAG argument instead of the
     default "head" revision.  As well as arbitrary tags defined with
     the `tag' or `rtag' command, two special tags are always
     available: `HEAD' refers to the most recent version available in
     the repository, and `BASE' refers to the revision you last checked
     out into the current working directory.

     The tag specification is sticky when you use this with `checkout'
     or `update' to make your own copy of a file: CVS remembers the tag
     and continues to use it on future update commands, until you
     specify otherwise (for more information on sticky tags/dates,
     *note Sticky tags::.).  The tag can be either a symbolic or
     numeric tag.  *Note Tags::.

     Specifying the `-q' global option along with the `-r' command
     option is often useful, to suppress the warning messages when the
     RCS history file does not contain the specified tag.

     *Warning:* this is not the same as the overall `cvs -r' option,
     which you can specify to the left of a cvs command!

     `-r' is available with the `checkout', `commit', `diff',
     `history', `export', `rdiff', `rtag', and `update' commands.

admin--Administration front end for rcs
=======================================

   * Requires: repository, working directory.

   * Changes: repository.

   * Synonym: rcs

   This is the CVS interface to assorted administrative RCS facilities,
documented in rcs(1).  `admin' simply passes all its options and
arguments to the `rcs' command; it does no filtering or other
processing.  This command *does* work recursively, however, so extreme
care should be used.

   If there is a group whose name matches a compiled in value which
defaults to `cvsadmin', only members of that group can use `cvs admin'.
To disallow `cvs admin' for all users, create a group with no users in
it.

admin options
-------------

   Not all valid `rcs' options are useful together with CVS.  Some even
makes it impossible to use CVS until you undo the effect!

   This description of the available options is based on the `rcs(1)'
man page, but modified to suit readers that are more interested in CVS
than RCS.

`-AOLDFILE'
     Might not work together with CVS.  Append the access list of
     OLDFILE to the access list of the RCS file.

`-aLOGINS'
     Might not work together with CVS.  Append the login names
     appearing in the comma-separated list LOGINS to the access list of
     the RCS file.

`-b[REV]'
     When used with bare RCS, this option sets the default branch to
     REV; in CVS sticky tags (*note Sticky tags::.) are a better way to
     decide which branch you want to work on.  There is one use with
     CVS: to revert to the vendor's version when using vendor branches
     (*note Reverting local changes::.).

`-cSTRING'
     Useful with CVS.  Sets the comment leader to STRING.  The comment
     leader is printed before every log message line generated by the
     keyword `$Log$' (*note Keyword substitution::.).  This is useful
     for programming languages without multi-line comments.  RCS
     initially guesses the value of the comment leader from the file
     name extension when the file is first committed.

`-e[LOGINS]'
     Might not work together with CVS.  Erase the login names appearing
     in the comma-separated list LOGINS from the access list of the RCS
     file.  If LOGINS is omitted, erase the entire access list.

`-I'
     Run interactively, even if the standard input is not a terminal.

`-i'
     Useless with CVS.  When using bare RCS, this is used to create and
     initialize a new RCS file, without depositing a revision.

`-kSUBST'
     Useful with CVS.  Set the default keyword substitution to SUBST.
     *Note Keyword substitution::.  Giving an explicit `-k' option to
     `cvs update', `cvs export', or `cvs checkout' overrides this
     default.

`-l[REV]'
     Lock the revision with number REV.  If a branch is given, lock the
     latest revision on that branch.  If REV is omitted, lock the
     latest revision on the default branch.

     This can be used in conjunction with the `rcslock.pl' script in
     the `contrib' directory of the CVS source distribution to provide
     reserved checkouts (where only one user can be editing a given
     file at a time).  See the comments in that file for details (and
     see the `README' file in that directory for disclaimers about the
     unsupported nature of contrib).  According to comments in that
     file, locking must set to strict (which is the default).

`-L'
     Set locking to strict.  Strict locking means that the owner of an
     RCS file is not exempt from locking for checkin.  For use with
     CVS, strict locking must be set; see the discussion under the `-l'
     option above.

`-mREV:MSG'
     Replace the log message of revision REV with MSG.

`-NNAME[:[REV]]'
     Act like `-n', except override any previous assignment of NAME.

`-nNAME[:[REV]]'
     Associate the symbolic name NAME with the branch or revision REV.
     It is normally better to use `cvs tag' or `cvs rtag' instead.
     Delete the symbolic name if both `:' and REV are omitted;
     otherwise, print an error message if NAME is already associated
     with another number.  If REV is symbolic, it is expanded before
     association.  A REV consisting of a branch number followed by a
     `.' stands for the current latest revision in the branch.  A `:'
     with an empty REV stands for the current latest revision on the
     default branch, normally the trunk.  For example, `rcs -nNAME:
     RCS/*' associates NAME with the current latest revision of all the
     named RCS files; this contrasts with `rcs -nNAME:$ RCS/*' which
     associates NAME with the revision numbers extracted from keyword
     strings in the corresponding working files.

`-oRANGE'
     Potentially useful, but dangerous, with CVS (see below).  Deletes
     ("outdates") the revisions given by RANGE.  A range consisting of
     a single revision number means that revision.  A range consisting
     of a branch number means the latest revision on that branch.  A
     range of the form `REV1:REV2' means revisions REV1 to REV2 on the
     same branch, `:REV' means from the beginning of the branch
     containing REV up to and including REV, and `REV:' means from
     revision REV to the end of the branch containing REV.  None of the
     outdated revisions may have branches or locks.

     Due to the way CVS handles branches REV cannot be specified
     symbolically if it is a branch.  *Note Magic branch numbers::, for
     an explanation.

     Make sure that no-one has checked out a copy of the revision you
     outdate.  Strange things will happen if he starts to edit it and
     tries to check it back in.  For this reason, this option is not a
     good way to take back a bogus commit; commit a new revision
     undoing the bogus change instead (*note Merging two revisions::.).

`-q'
     Run quietly; do not print diagnostics.

`-sSTATE[:REV]'
     Useful with CVS.  Set the state attribute of the revision REV to
     STATE.  If REV is a branch number, assume the latest revision on
     that branch.  If REV is omitted, assume the latest revision on the
     default branch.  Any identifier is acceptable for STATE.  A useful
     set of states is `Exp' (for experimental), `Stab' (for stable),
     and `Rel' (for released).  By default, the state of a new revision
     is set to `Exp' when it is created.  The state is visible in the
     output from CVS LOG (*note log::.), and in the `$Log$' and
     `$State$' keywords (*note Keyword substitution::.).  Note that CVS
     uses the `dead' state for its own purposes; to take a file to or
     from the `dead' state use commands like `cvs remove' and `cvs
     add', not `cvs admin -s'.

`-t[FILE]'
     Useful with CVS.  Write descriptive text from the contents of the
     named FILE into the RCS file, deleting the existing text.  The
     FILE pathname may not begin with `-'.  If FILE is omitted, obtain
     the text from standard input, terminated by end-of-file or by a
     line containing `.' by itself.  Prompt for the text if interaction
     is possible; see `-I'.  The descriptive text can be seen in the
     output from `cvs log' (*note log::.).

`-t-STRING'
     Similar to `-tFILE'. Write descriptive text from the STRING into
     the RCS file, deleting the existing text.

`-U'
     Set locking to non-strict.  Non-strict locking means that the
     owner of a file need not lock a revision for checkin.  For use
     with CVS, strict locking must be set; see the discussion under the
     `-l' option above.

`-u[REV]'
     See the option `-l' above, for a discussion of using this option
     with CVS.  Unlock the revision with number REV.  If a branch is
     given, unlock the latest revision on that branch.  If REV is
     omitted, remove the latest lock held by the caller.  Normally,
     only the locker of a revision may unlock it.  Somebody else
     unlocking a revision breaks the lock.  This causes a mail message
     to be sent to the original locker.  The message contains a
     commentary solicited from the breaker.  The commentary is
     terminated by end-of-file or by a line containing `.' by itself.

`-VN'
     Emulate RCS version N. Use -VN to make an RCS file acceptable to
     RCS version N by discarding information that would confuse version
     N.

`-xSUFFIXES'
     Useless with CVS. Use SUFFIXES to characterize RCS files.

Outdating is dangerous
......................

   First, an example of how *not* to use the `admin' command.  It is
included to stress the fact that this command can be quite dangerous
unless you know *exactly* what you are doing.

   The `-o' option can be used to "outdate" old revisions from the
history file.  If you are short on disc this option might help you.
But think twice before using it--there is no way short of restoring the
latest backup to undo this command!

   The next line is an example of a command that you would *not* like
to execute.

     $ cvs admin -o:R_1_02 .

   The above command will delete all revisions up to, and including,
the revision that corresponds to the tag R_1_02.  But beware!  If there
are files that have not changed between R_1_02 and R_1_03 the file will
have *the same* numerical revision number assigned to the tags R_1_02
and R_1_03.  So not only will it be impossible to retrieve R_1_02;
R_1_03 will also have to be restored from the tapes!

Comment leaders
...............

   If you use the `$Log$' keyword and you do not agree with the guess
for comment leader that CVS has done, you can enforce your will with
`cvs admin -c'.  This might be suitable for `nroff' source:

     $ cvs admin -c'.\" ' *.man
     $ rm *.man
     $ cvs update

   The two last steps are to make sure that you get the versions with
correct comment leaders in your working files.

checkout--Check out sources for editing
=======================================

   * Synopsis: checkout [options] modules...

   * Requires: repository.

   * Changes: working directory.

   * Synonyms: co, get

   Make a working directory containing copies of the source files
specified by MODULES.  You must execute `checkout' before using most of
the other CVS commands, since most of them operate on your working
directory.

   The MODULES part of the command are either symbolic names for some
collection of source directories and files, or paths to directories or
files in the repository.  The symbolic names are defined in the
`modules' file.  *Note modules::.

   Depending on the modules you specify, `checkout' may recursively
create directories and populate them with the appropriate source files.
You can then edit these source files at any time (regardless of
whether other software developers are editing their own copies of the
sources); update them to include new changes applied by others to the
source repository; or commit your work as a permanent change to the
source repository.

   Note that `checkout' is used to create directories.  The top-level
directory created is always added to the directory where `checkout' is
invoked, and usually has the same name as the specified module.  In the
case of a module alias, the created sub-directory may have a different
name, but you can be sure that it will be a sub-directory, and that
`checkout' will show the relative path leading to each file as it is
extracted into your private work area (unless you specify the `-Q'
global option).

   The files created by `checkout' are created read-write, unless the
`-r' option to CVS (*note Global options::.) is specified, the
`CVSREAD' environment variable is specified (*note Environment
variables::.), or a watch is in effect for that file (*note Watches::.).

   Running `checkout' on a directory that was already built by a prior
`checkout' is also permitted, and has the same effect as specifying the
`-d' option to the `update' command, that is, any new directories that
have been created in the repository will appear in your work area.
*Note update::.

   For the output produced by the `checkout' command see *Note update
output::.

checkout options
----------------

   These standard options are supported by `checkout' (*note Common
options::., for a complete description of them):

`-D DATE'
     Use the most recent revision no later than DATE.  This option is
     sticky, and implies `-P'.  See *Note Sticky tags::, for more
     information on sticky tags/dates.

`-f'
     Only useful with the `-D DATE' or `-r TAG' flags.  If no matching
     revision is found, retrieve the most recent revision (instead of
     ignoring the file).

`-k KFLAG'
     Process RCS keywords according to KFLAG.  See co(1).  This option
     is sticky; future updates of this file in this working directory
     will use the same KFLAG.  The `status' command can be viewed to
     see the sticky options.  *Note status::.

`-l'
     Local; run only in current working directory.

`-n'
     Do not run any checkout program (as specified with the `-o' option
     in the modules file; *note modules::.).

`-P'
     Prune empty directories.  See *Note Moving directories::.

`-p'
     Pipe files to the standard output.

`-r TAG'
     Use revision TAG.  This option is sticky, and implies `-P'.  See
     *Note Sticky tags::, for more information on sticky tags/dates.

   In addition to those, you can use these special command options with
`checkout':

`-A'
     Reset any sticky tags, dates, or `-k' options.  See *Note Sticky
     tags::, for more information on sticky tags/dates.

`-c'
     Copy the module file, sorted, to the standard output, instead of
     creating or modifying any files or directories in your working
     directory.

`-d DIR'
     Create a directory called DIR for the working files, instead of
     using the module name.  Unless you also use `-N', the paths
     created under DIR will be as short as possible.

`-j TAG'
     With two `-j' options, merge changes from the revision specified
     with the first `-j' option to the revision specified with the
     second `j' option, into the working directory.

     With one `-j' option, merge changes from the ancestor revision to
     the revision specified with the `-j' option, into the working
     directory.  The ancestor revision is the common ancestor of the
     revision which the working directory is based on, and the revision
     specified in the `-j' option.

     In addition, each -j option can contain an optional date
     specification which, when used with branches, can limit the chosen
     revision to one within a specific date.  An optional date is
     specified by adding a colon (:) to the tag:
     `-jSYMBOLIC_TAG:DATE_SPECIFIER'.

     *Note Merging::.

`-N'
     Only useful together with `-d DIR'.  With this option, CVS will
     not shorten module paths in your working directory.  (Normally,
     CVS shortens paths as much as possible when you specify an
     explicit target directory).

`-s'
     Like `-c', but include the status of all modules, and sort it by
     the status string.  *Note modules::, for info about the `-s'
     option that is used inside the modules file to set the module
     status.

   * Changes: repository.

   * Synonym: ci

   *Warning:* The `-f FILE' option will probably be renamed to `-F
FILE', and `-f' will be given a new behavior in future releases of CVS.

   Use `commit' when you want to incorporate changes from your working
source files into the source repository.

   If you don't specify particular files to commit, all of the files in
your working current directory are examined.  `commit' is careful to
change in the repository only those files that you have really changed.
By default (or if you explicitly specify the `-R' option), files in
subdirectories are also examined and committed if they have changed;
you can use the `-l' option to limit `commit' to the current directory
only.

   `commit' verifies that the selected files are up to date with the
current revisions in the source repository; it will notify you, and
exit without committing, if any of the specified files must be made
current first with `update' (*note update::.).  `commit' does not call
the `update' command for you, but rather leaves that for you to do when
the time is right.

   When all is well, an editor is invoked to allow you to enter a log
message that will be written to one or more logging programs (*note
modules::., and *note loginfo::.) and placed in the RCS history file
inside the repository.  This log message can be retrieved with the
`log' command; *Note log::.  You can specify the log message on the
command line with the `-m MESSAGE' option, and thus avoid the editor
invocation, or use the `-f FILE' option to specify that the argument
file contains the log message.

commit options
--------------

   These standard options are supported by `commit' (*note Common
options::., for a complete description of them):

`-l'
     Local; run only in current working directory.

`-n'
     Do not run any module program.

`-R'
     Commit directories recursively.  This is on by default.

`-r REVISION'
     Commit to REVISION.  REVISION must be either a branch, or a
     revision on the main trunk that is higher than any existing
     revision number (*note Assigning revisions::.).  You cannot commit
     to a specific revision on a branch.

   `commit' also supports these options:

`-F FILE'
     Read the log message from FILE, instead of invoking an editor.

`-f'
     Note that this is not the standard behavior of the `-f' option as
     defined in *Note Common options::.

     Force CVS to commit a new revision even if you haven't made any
     changes to the file.  If the current revision of FILE is 1.7, then
     the following two commands are equivalent:

          $ cvs commit -f FILE
          $ cvs commit -r 1.8 FILE

     The `-f' option disables recursion (i.e., it implies `-l').  To
     force CVS to commit a new revision for all files in all
     subdirectories, you must use `-f -R'.

`-m MESSAGE'
     Use MESSAGE as the log message, instead of invoking an editor.

Committing to a branch
......................

   You can commit to a branch revision (one that has an even number of
dots) with the `-r' option.  To create a branch revision, use the `-b'
option of the `rtag' or `tag' commands (*note tag::.  or *note
rtag::.).  Then, either `checkout' or `update' can be used to base your
sources on the newly created branch.  From that point on, all `commit'
changes made within these working sources will be automatically added
to a branch revision, thereby not disturbing main-line development in
any way.  For example, if you had to create a patch to the 1.2 version
of the product, even though the 2.0 version is already under
development, you might do:

     $ cvs rtag -b -r FCS1_2 FCS1_2_Patch product_module
     $ cvs checkout -r FCS1_2_Patch product_module
     $ cd product_module
     [[ hack away ]]
     $ cvs commit

This works automatically since the `-r' option is sticky.

Creating the branch after editing
.................................

   Say you have been working on some extremely experimental software,
based on whatever revision you happened to checkout last week.  If
others in your group would like to work on this software with you, but
without disturbing main-line development, you could commit your change
to a new branch.  Others can then checkout your experimental stuff and
utilize the full benefit of CVS conflict resolution.  The scenario might
look like:

     [[ hacked sources are present ]]
     $ cvs tag -b EXPR1
     $ cvs update -r EXPR1
     $ cvs commit

   The `update' command will make the `-r EXPR1' option sticky on all
files.  Note that your changes to the files will never be removed by the
`update' command.  The `commit' will automatically commit to the
correct branch, because the `-r' is sticky.  You could also do like
this:

     [[ hacked sources are present ]]
     $ cvs tag -b EXPR1
     $ cvs commit -r EXPR1

but then, only those files that were changed by you will have the `-r
EXPR1' sticky flag.  If you hack away, and commit without specifying
the `-r EXPR1' flag, some files may accidentally end up on the main
trunk.

   To work with you on the experimental change, others would simply do

     $ cvs checkout -r EXPR1 whatever_module
