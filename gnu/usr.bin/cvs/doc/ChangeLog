Tue Oct  1 14:15:33 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo: Revert all recent changes (the last unscathed one
	is the CVSUMASK one from Sunday).  For the most part said changes
	are for new features which are not appropriate at this stage of
	the release process.  None of the changes being reverted need to
	go into 1.9, that is for sure.

Mon Sep 30 18:17:34 1996  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Credits): add comment asking if we should update.
	Add more detail about printing Letter on A4.
	Add some comments about internal comments.
	(From files): describe "cvs import -b 1" for importing existing
	projects onto the main branch.
	(First import): add a couple of helpful hints about naming vendor
	and release tags, etc., and regularize the examples with this.
	(Tracking sources): noted some reasons why you might use vendor
	branches with "cvs import".
	(Update imports): mention using "update" in place of "checkout" if
	you have an existing working directory.
	(Binary files in imports): add sub-menu separator comment.
	(Tracking sources): new menu entry "Reverting to vendor release".
	(Reverting to vendor release): new node to describe reverting
	local changes and optionally using patch(1) to move local changes
	forward.
	(Global options): describe -D and -g, as well as DIFFBIN and
	GREPBIN.
	(export examples): add one.
	(import options): describe the effect of '-b 1'.
	
Mon Sep 30 08:09:53 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo: Adjust comments concerning A4 vs. US letter,
	referring to ../README.

	* cvs.texinfo (Common options): Add comment about dates which CVS
	uses in output.

Sun Sep 29 11:14:16 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Keyword list): Don't mention Name twice.

	* cvs.texinfo (File permissions): Expand CVSUMASK stuff a bit.
	(Setting a watch, Environment variables, Global options): Update
	index entries for "read-only files, and ...".

	* cvsclient.texi (Requests): State that Gzip-stream is preferred
	to gzip-file-contents.  Cite RFC1952/1951 rather than just "gzip".
	Say that RFC1950/1951 compression is also known as "zlib".

Sat Sep 28 09:31:45 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Repository): Move all information about the
	internal structure of the repository to User modules node.  Rename
	it to "Repository storage" ("User modules" wasn't particularly
	clear).  Mention CVSUMASK.  Much clarification and
	reorganization.
	(Basic concepts): Remove material which duplicates what is now in
	Repository.  Rewrite paragraph introducing modules.

	* cvs.texinfo (Starting a new project): In discussing difficulty
	in renaming files, don't refer to "cvs 1.x"--there is no
	non-vaporous "cvs 2.x".  Reword to reflect that part of the reason
	to avoid renames (where possible) is not because of CVS at all, and
	to try to give a general impression of how bad CVS issues involved in
	renaming are.

Fri Sep 27 04:23:44 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Adding files): Talk about directories, not modules,
	since that is what is meant.  Suggest using -kb option to add
	rather than running cvs admin after the fact and xref to Binary
	files not admin examples.  Incorporate information which had been
	in "add" node (there was a lot of duplication).  Don't document
	use of "add" on a directory to take the place of "cvs update -d";
	the latter is simpler and more logical.
	(add, add options, add examples): Removed.
	(release output, release options): Update xrefs accordingly.
	(Adding files, Removing files): Mention the fact that adds and
	removes are branch-specific.
	(Merging adds and removals): New node.

	* cvs.texinfo (Concurrency): When mentioning RCS locks, use the
	term reserved checkouts and xref to the place where we discuss
	them in more depth.

Thu Sep 26 08:26:01 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (log): Add comments about timezones.
	(log, Common options): Add index entries for timezone and zone, time.

Wed Sep 25 11:05:30 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (log options): Add xref to where we describe the
	date formats that -d accepts.
	(Common options): Don't refer to date formats accepted by co(1);
	CVS's rules have never been the same.  Add long whiny comment
	about what a mess date formats are.

Tue Sep 24 11:49:02 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (From other version control systems): The RCS file
	must not be locked when you copy it to the CVS repository.

	* cvs.texinfo (Editing files): Also discuss how to revert in the
	non-watch case.  Add some index entries.

	* cvs.texinfo (update output): Add comment about how we *should*
	be handling .# files.  Mention fact that it is different under
	VMS.  Add .# to index.

Fri Sep 20 13:08:33 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Multiple developers): Revise text on reserved
	versus unreserved checkouts extensively.  Move index entries for
	"reserved checkouts" and "RCS-style locking" to here.  Add
	cross-reference to cvs admin -l.  Add new section "Choosing a
	model".
	(Editing files): Add note about use of the word "checkout".

Tue Sep 17 00:54:57 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Defining the module): Don't suggest "cvs co
	modules"; that depends on a "modules" module being defined which
	is not the default which is created by "cvs init".  Instead
	suggest "cvs co CVSROOT/modules" which should always work.

Tue Sep 17 00:43:49 1996  VaX#n8  <vax@linkdead.paranoia.com>
			  and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Rename by copying): Suggest "cvs tag -d" on the file
	"new", not on everything.  Also don't suggest deleting branch tags.

Tue Sep 17 00:34:39 1996  David A. Swierczek  <swierczekd@med.ge.com>

	* Makefile.in (install-info): Note whether files are in srcdir and
	deal with it rather than cd'ing into srcdir.

Mon Sep 16 23:33:36 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Wrappers): Add comment about using wrappers to
	compress files in the repository.

	* cvs.texinfo (modules): Add comments about how we should be
	documenting how -i and friends operate in client/server CVS.

	* cvs.texinfo (File permissions): Describe the need for write
	permissions for locks and val-tags.

	* cvs.texinfo (commitinfo): Add comment about using commitinfo to
	enforce who has access.

	* cvs.texinfo (checkout): Refer to "update output" node.
	(import): Add new import output node.
	(release): Correct release output menu entry (used to be
	release options instead).
	(update output): Say this is output from checkout as well as
	update.

Fri Sep 13 23:55:42 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Magic branch numbers): Delete song and dance about
	how cvs log can't cope with magic branches because rlog doesn't
	know about them; cvs log no longer calls rlog.  Delete item about
	how you can't specify a symbolic branch to cvs log; that is fixed.

Wed Sep 11 22:48:21 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.texinfo (Password authentication server): Add comments
	regarding port numbers and troubleshooting.

	with recovering from failure to use -kb.

	* cvs.texinfo (Conflicts example): Describe the "feature" by which
	CVS won't check in files with conflicts.
	(File status): Expand and revise to document all the possible
	statuses from cvs status.  Also document "Working revision" and

	CVS_RSH.

	* cvsclient.texi (Protocol Notes): When talking about having the

	create lock files in the repository.

	* cvsclient.texi (Responses): In F response, make at least a
	minimal attempt to define "flush".

	* cvs.texinfo (Wrappers): Document -k.
	(From files, Binary files in imports): Say that imports can deal
	with binary files and refer to Wrappers node for details.

Fri Sep 13 10:52:09 1996  Greg A. Woods  <woods@clapton.seachange.com>

	list of configuration management functionality), and deleted some
	functions such as tape construction which are not provided by the
	well-known configuration management systems.

 	methods; fix pserver info.

	more accurately where we put temporary files.

	* cvs.texinfo (From files): Say directory tree instead of module
	where that is what we mean.  Use @var{wdir} and @var{rdir} in the
	example instead of using @var{dir} for two different things.
	(From files): Say directory tree instead of module
	where that is what we mean.
	(Binary files): When using cvs admin -kb, one needs an extra
	commit step on non-unix systems.
	(Binary files in imports): New node.
	(Wrappers): Add comment regarding indent example.
	(Top): Don't refer to modules when that is not what we mean.

	on complex and unknown security bugs to clarify that it is

	should better document tagging the branchpoint.

Tue Apr  9 19:59:45 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>
