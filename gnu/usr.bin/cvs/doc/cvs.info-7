Reference manual for Administrative files
*****************************************

   Inside the repository, in the directory `$CVSROOT/CVSROOT', there
are a number of supportive files for CVS.  You can use CVS in a limited
fashion without any of them, but if they are set up properly they can
help make life easier.  For a discussion of how to edit them, see *Note
Intro administrative files::.

   The most important of these files is the `modules' file, which
defines the modules inside the repository.

The modules file
================

   The `modules' file records your definitions of names for collections
of source code.  CVS will use these definitions if you use CVS to
update the modules file (use normal commands like `add', `commit', etc).

   The `modules' file may contain blank lines and comments (lines
beginning with `#') as well as module definitions.  Long lines can be
continued on the next line by specifying a backslash (`\') as the last
character on the line.

   There are three basic types of modules: alias modules, regular
modules, and ampersand modules.  The difference between them is the way
that they map files in the repository to files in the working
directory.  In all of the following examples, the top-level repository
contains a directory called `first-dir', which contains two files,
`file1' and `file2', and a directory `sdir'.  `first-dir/sdir' contains
a file `sfile'.

* Alias modules::             The simplest kind of module
* Regular modules::
* Ampersand modules::
* Excluding directories::     Excluding directories from a module
* Module options::            Regular and ampersand modules can take options

File: cvs.info,  Node: Alias modules,  Next: Regular modules,  Up: modules

Alias modules
-------------

   Alias modules are the simplest kind of module:

`MNAME -a ALIASES...'
     This represents the simplest way of defining a module MNAME.  The
     `-a' flags the definition as a simple alias: CVS will treat any
     use of MNAME (as a command argument) as if the list of names
     ALIASES had been specified instead.  ALIASES may contain either
     other module names or paths.  When you use paths in aliases,
     `checkout' creates all intermediate directories in the working
     directory, just as if the path had been specified explicitly in
     the CVS arguments.

   For example, if the modules file contains:

     amodule -a first-dir

then the following two commands are equivalent:

     $ cvs co amodule
     $ cvs co first-dir

and they each would provide output such as:

     cvs checkout: Updating first-dir
     U first-dir/file1
     U first-dir/file2
     cvs checkout: Updating first-dir/sdir
     U first-dir/sdir/sfile


File: cvs.info,  Node: Regular modules,  Next: Ampersand modules,  Prev: Alias modules,  Up: modules

Regular modules
---------------

`MNAME [ options ] DIR [ FILES... ]'
     In the simplest case, this form of module definition reduces to
     `MNAME DIR'.  This defines all the files in directory DIR as
     module mname.  DIR is a relative path (from `$CVSROOT') to a
     directory of source in the source repository.  In this case, on
     checkout, a single directory called MNAME is created as a working
     directory; no intermediate directory levels are used by default,
     even if DIR was a path involving several directory levels.

   For example, if a module is defined by:

     regmodule first-dir

then regmodule will contain the files from first-dir:

     $ cvs co regmodule
     cvs checkout: Updating regmodule
     U regmodule/file1
     U regmodule/file2
     cvs checkout: Updating regmodule/sdir
     U regmodule/sdir/sfile
     $

   By explicitly specifying files in the module definition after DIR,
you can select particular files from directory DIR.  Here is an example:

     regfiles first-dir/sdir sfile

With this definition, getting the regfiles module will create a single
working directory `regfiles' containing the file listed, which comes
from a directory deeper in the CVS source repository:

     $ cvs co regfiles
     U regfiles/sfile
     $


File: cvs.info,  Node: Ampersand modules,  Next: Excluding directories,  Prev: Regular modules,  Up: modules

Ampersand modules
-----------------

   A module definition can refer to other modules by including
`&MODULE' in its definition.
     MNAME [ options ] &MODULE...

   Then getting the module creates a subdirectory for each such module,
in the directory containing the module.  For example, if modules
contains

     ampermod &first-dir

   then a checkout will create an `ampermod' directory which contains a
directory called `first-dir', which in turns contains all the
directories and files which live there.  For example, the command

     $ cvs co ampermod

will create the following files:

     ampermod/first-dir/file1
     ampermod/first-dir/file2
     ampermod/first-dir/sdir/sfile

   There is one quirk/bug: the messages that CVS prints omit the
`ampermod', and thus do not correctly display the location to which it
is checking out the files:

     $ cvs co ampermod
     cvs checkout: Updating first-dir
     U first-dir/file1
     U first-dir/file2
     cvs checkout: Updating first-dir/sdir
     U first-dir/sdir/sfile
     $

   Do not rely on this buggy behavior; it may get fixed in a future
release of CVS.


File: cvs.info,  Node: Excluding directories,  Next: Module options,  Prev: Ampersand modules,  Up: modules

Excluding directories
---------------------

   An alias module may exclude particular directories from other
modules by using an exclamation mark (`!') before the name of each
directory to be excluded.

   For example, if the modules file contains:

     exmodule -a !first-dir/sdir first-dir

   then checking out the module `exmodule' will check out everything in
`first-dir' except any files in the subdirectory `first-dir/sdir'.


File: cvs.info,  Node: Module options,  Next: Module program options,  Prev: Excluding directories,  Up: modules

Module options
--------------

   Either regular modules or ampersand modules can contain options,
which supply additional information concerning the module.

`-d NAME'
     Name the working directory something other than the module name.

`-e PROG'
     Specify a program PROG to run whenever files in a module are
     exported.  PROG runs with a single argument, the module name.

`-i PROG'
     Specify a program PROG to run whenever files in a module are
     committed.  PROG runs with a single argument, the full pathname of
     the affected directory in a source repository.  The `commitinfo',
     `loginfo', and `verifymsg' files provide other ways to call a
     program on commit.

`-o PROG'
     Specify a program PROG to run whenever files in a module are
     checked out.  PROG runs with a single argument, the module name.

`-s STATUS'
     Assign a status to the module.  When the module file is printed
     with `cvs checkout -s' the modules are sorted according to
     primarily module status, and secondarily according to the module
     name.  This option has no other meaning.  You can use this option
     for several things besides status: for instance, list the person
     that is responsible for this module.

`-t PROG'
     Specify a program PROG to run whenever files in a module are
     tagged with `rtag'.  PROG runs with two arguments: the module name
     and the symbolic tag specified to `rtag'.  It is not run when
     `tag' is executed.  Generally you will find that taginfo is a
     better solution (*note user-defined logging::).

`-u PROG'
     Specify a program PROG to run whenever `cvs update' is executed
     from the top-level directory of the checked-out module.  PROG runs
     with a single argument, the full path to the source repository for
     this module.

   You should also see *note Module program options:: about how the
"program options" programs are run.


File: cvs.info,  Node: Module program options,  Prev: Module options,  Up: modules

How the modules file "program options" programs are run
-------------------------------------------------------

For checkout, rtag, and export, the program is server-based, and as
such the following applies:-

   If using remote access methods (pserver, ext, etc.), CVS will
execute this program on the server from a temporary directory. The path
is searched for this program.

   If using "local access" (on a local or remote NFS filesystem, i.e.
repository set just to a path), the program will be executed from the
newly checked-out tree, if found there, or alternatively searched for
in the path if not.

The commit and update programs are locally-based, and are run as
follows:-

   The program is always run locally. One must re-checkout the tree one
is using if these options are updated in the modules administrative
file. The file CVS/Checkin.prog contains the value of the option `-i'
set in the modules file, and similarly for the file CVS/Update.prog and
`-u'. The program is always executed from the top level of the
checked-out copy on the client. Again, the program is first searched
for in the checked-out copy and then using the path.

   The programs are all run after the operation has effectively
completed.

The cvswrappers file
====================

   Wrappers refers to a CVS feature which lets you control certain
settings based on the name of the file which is being operated on.  The
settings are `-k' for binary files, and `-m' for nonmergeable text
files.

   The `-m' option specifies the merge methodology that should be used
when a non-binary file is updated.  `MERGE' means the usual CVS
behavior: try to merge the files.  `COPY' means that `cvs update' will
refuse to merge files, as it also does for files specified as binary
with `-kb' (but if the file is specified as binary, there is no need to
specify `-m 'COPY'').  CVS will provide the user with the two versions
of the files, and require the user using mechanisms outside CVS, to
insert any necessary changes.  *WARNING*: do not use `COPY' with CVS
1.9 or earlier-such versions of CVS will copy one version of your file
over the other, wiping out the previous contents.  The `-m' wrapper
option only affects behavior when merging is done on update; it does
not affect how files are stored.  See *Note Binary files::, for more on
binary files.

   The basic format of the file `cvswrappers' is:

     wildcard     [option value][option value]...
     
     where option is one of
     -m           update methodology      value: MERGE or COPY
     -k           keyword expansion       value: expansion mode
     
     and value is a single-quote delimited value.

   For example, the following command imports a directory, treating
files whose name ends in `.exe' as binary:

     cvs import -I ! -W "*.exe -k 'b'" first-dir vendortag reltag


File: cvs.info,  Node: commit files,  Next: commitinfo,  Prev: Wrappers,  Up: Administrative files

The commit support files
========================

   The `-i' flag in the `modules' file can be used to run a certain
program whenever files are committed (*note modules::).  The files
described in this section provide other, more flexible, ways to run
programs whenever something is committed.

   There are three kind of programs that can be run on commit.  They
are specified in files in the repository, as described below.  The
following table summarizes the file names and the purpose of the
corresponding programs.

`commitinfo'
     The program is responsible for checking that the commit is
     allowed.  If it exits with a non-zero exit status the commit will
     be aborted.

`verifymsg'
     The specified program is used to evaluate the log message, and
     possibly verify that it contains all required fields.  This is
     most useful in combination with the `rcsinfo' file, which can hold
     a log message template (*note rcsinfo::).

`editinfo'
     The specified program is used to edit the log message, and
     possibly verify that it contains all required fields.  This is
     most useful in combination with the `rcsinfo' file, which can hold
     a log message template (*note rcsinfo::).  (obsolete)

`loginfo'
     The specified program is called when the commit is complete.  It
     receives the log message and some additional information and can
     store the log message in a file, or mail it to appropriate
     persons, or maybe post it to a local newsgroup, or...  Your
     imagination is the limit!

The common syntax
-----------------

   The administrative files such as `commitinfo', `loginfo', `rcsinfo',
`verifymsg', etc., all have a common format.  The purpose of the files
are described later on.  The common syntax is described here.

   Each line contains the following:
   * A regular expression.  This is a basic regular expression in the
     syntax used by GNU emacs.

   * A whitespace separator--one or more spaces and/or tabs.

   * A file name or command-line template.

Blank lines are ignored.  Lines that start with the character `#' are
treated as comments.  Long lines unfortunately can _not_ be broken in
two parts in any way.

   The first regular expression that matches the current directory name
in the repository is used.  The rest of the line is used as a file name
or command-line as appropriate.


File: cvs.info,  Node: commitinfo,  Next: verifymsg,  Prev: commit files,  Up: Administrative files

Commitinfo
==========

   The `commitinfo' file defines programs to execute whenever `cvs
commit' is about to execute.  These programs are used for pre-commit
checking to verify that the modified, added and removed files are really
ready to be committed.  This could be used, for instance, to verify
that the changed files conform to to your site's standards for coding
practice.

   As mentioned earlier, each line in the `commitinfo' file consists of
a regular expression and a command-line template.  The template can
include a program name and any number of arguments you wish to supply
to it.  The full path to the current source repository is appended to
the template, followed by the file names of any files involved in the
commit (added, removed, and modified files).

   The first line with a regular expression matching the directory
within the repository will be used.  If the command returns a non-zero
exit status the commit will be aborted.

   If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions
in this file, the `DEFAULT' line is used, if it is specified.

   All occurrences of the name `ALL' appearing as a regular expression
are used in addition to the first matching regular expression or the
name `DEFAULT'.

   Note: when CVS is accessing a remote repository, `commitinfo' will
be run on the _remote_ (i.e., server) side, not the client side (*note
Remote repositories::).


File: cvs.info,  Node: verifymsg,  Next: editinfo,  Prev: commitinfo,  Up: Administrative files

Verifying log messages
======================

   Once you have entered a log message, you can evaluate that message
to check for specific content, such as a bug ID.  Use the `verifymsg'
file to specify a program that is used to verify the log message.  This
program could be a simple script that checks that the entered message
contains the required fields.

   The `verifymsg' file is often most useful together with the
`rcsinfo' file, which can be used to specify a log message template.

   Each line in the `verifymsg' file consists of a regular expression
and a command-line template.  The template must include a program name,
and can include any number of arguments.  The full path to the current
log message template file is appended to the template.

   One thing that should be noted is that the `ALL' keyword is not
supported.  If more than one matching line is found, the first one is
used.  This can be useful for specifying a default verification script
in a directory, and then overriding it in a subdirectory.

   If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions
in this file, the `DEFAULT' line is used, if it is specified.

   If the verification script exits with a non-zero exit status, the
commit is aborted.

   Note that the verification script cannot change the log message; it
can merely accept it or reject it.

   The following is a little silly example of a `verifymsg' file,
together with the corresponding `rcsinfo' file, the log message
template and an verification  script.  We begin with the log message
template.  We want to always record a bug-id number on the first line
of the log message.  The rest of log message is free text.  The
following template is found in the file `/usr/cvssupport/tc.template'.

     BugId:

   The script `/usr/cvssupport/bugid.verify' is used to evaluate the
log message.

     #!/bin/sh
     #
     #       bugid.verify filename
     #
     #  Verify that the log message contains a valid bugid
     #  on the first line.
     #
     if head -1 < $1 | grep '^BugId:[ ]*[0-9][0-9]*$' > /dev/null; then
         exit 0
     else
         echo "No BugId found."
         exit 1
     fi

   The `verifymsg' file contains this line:

     ^tc     /usr/cvssupport/bugid.verify

   The `rcsinfo' file contains this line:

     ^tc     /usr/cvssupport/tc.template


File: cvs.info,  Node: editinfo,  Next: loginfo,  Prev: verifymsg,  Up: Administrative files

Editinfo
========

   _NOTE:_ The `editinfo' feature has been rendered obsolete.  To set a
default editor for log messages use the `EDITOR' environment variable
(*note Environment variables::) or the `-e' global option (*note Global
options::).  See *Note verifymsg::, for information on the use of the
`verifymsg' feature for evaluating log messages.

   If you want to make sure that all log messages look the same way,
you can use the `editinfo' file to specify a program that is used to
edit the log message.  This program could be a custom-made editor that
always enforces a certain style of the log message, or maybe a simple
shell script that calls an editor, and checks that the entered message
contains the required fields.

   If no matching line is found in the `editinfo' file, the editor
specified in the environment variable `$CVSEDITOR' is used instead.  If
that variable is not set, then the environment variable `$EDITOR' is
used instead.  If that variable is not set a default will be used.  See
*Note Committing your changes::.

   The `editinfo' file is often most useful together with the `rcsinfo'
file, which can be used to specify a log message template.

   Each line in the `editinfo' file consists of a regular expression
and a command-line template.  The template must include a program name,
and can include any number of arguments.  The full path to the current
log message template file is appended to the template.

   One thing that should be noted is that the `ALL' keyword is not
supported.  If more than one matching line is found, the first one is
used.  This can be useful for specifying a default edit script in a
module, and then overriding it in a subdirectory.

   If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions
in this file, the `DEFAULT' line is used, if it is specified.

   If the edit script exits with a non-zero exit status, the commit is
aborted.

   Note: when CVS is accessing a remote repository, or when the `-m' or
`-F' options to `cvs commit' are used, `editinfo' will not be consulted.
There is no good workaround for this; use `verifymsg' instead.

Editinfo example
----------------

   The following is a little silly example of a `editinfo' file,
together with the corresponding `rcsinfo' file, the log message
template and an editor script.  We begin with the log message template.
We want to always record a bug-id number on the first line of the log
message.  The rest of log message is free text.  The following template
is found in the file `/usr/cvssupport/tc.template'.

     BugId:

   The script `/usr/cvssupport/bugid.edit' is used to edit the log
message.

     #!/bin/sh
     #
     #       bugid.edit filename
     #
     #  Call $EDITOR on FILENAME, and verify that the
     #  resulting file contains a valid bugid on the first
     #  line.
     if [ "x$EDITOR" = "x" ]; then EDITOR=vi; fi
     if [ "x$CVSEDITOR" = "x" ]; then CVSEDITOR=$EDITOR; fi
     $CVSEDITOR $1
     until head -1|grep '^BugId:[ ]*[0-9][0-9]*$' < $1
     do  echo -n  "No BugId found.  Edit again? ([y]/n)"

             n*) exit 1;;
         esac
         $CVSEDITOR $1
     done

   The `editinfo' file contains this line:

     ^tc     /usr/cvssupport/bugid.edit

   The `rcsinfo' file contains this line:

     ^tc     /usr/cvssupport/tc.template


File: cvs.info,  Node: loginfo,  Next: rcsinfo,  Prev: editinfo,  Up: Administrative files

Loginfo
=======

   The `loginfo' file is used to control where `cvs commit' log
information is sent.  The first entry on a line is a regular expression
which is tested against the directory that the change is being made to,
relative to the `$CVSROOT'.  If a match is found, then the remainder of
the line is a filter program that should expect log information on its
standard input.

   If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions
in this file, the `DEFAULT' line is used, if it is specified.

   All occurrences of the name `ALL' appearing as a regular expression
are used in addition to the first matching regular expression or
`DEFAULT'.

   The first matching regular expression is used.

   *Note commit files::, for a description of the syntax of the
`loginfo' file.

   The user may specify a format string as part of the filter.  The
string is composed of a `%' followed by a space, or followed by a single
format character, or followed by a set of format characters surrounded
by `{' and `}' as separators.  The format characters are:

s
     file name

V
     old version number (pre-checkin)

v
     new version number (post-checkin)

   All other characters that appear in a format string expand to an
empty field (commas separating fields are still provided).

   For example, some valid format strings are `%', `%s', `%{s}', and
`%{sVv}'.

   The output will be a string of tokens separated by spaces.  For
backwards compatibility, the first token will be the repository
subdirectory.  The rest of the tokens will be comma-delimited lists of
the information requested in the format string.  For example, if
`/u/src/master/yoyodyne/tc' is the repository, `%{sVv}' is the format
string, and three files (ChangeLog, Makefile, foo.c) were modified, the
output might be:

     yoyodyne/tc ChangeLog,1.1,1.2 Makefile,1.3,1.4 foo.c,1.12,1.13

   As another example, `%{}' means that only the name of the repository
will be generated.

   Note: when CVS is accessing a remote repository, `loginfo' will be
run on the _remote_ (i.e., server) side, not the client side (*note
Remote repositories::).

Loginfo example
---------------

   The following `loginfo' file, together with the tiny shell-script
below, appends all log messages to the file
`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitlog', and any commits to the administrative
files (inside the `CVSROOT' directory) are also logged in
`/usr/adm/cvsroot-log'.  Commits to the `prog1' directory are mailed to
ceder.

     ALL             /usr/local/bin/cvs-log $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitlog $USER
     ^CVSROOT        /usr/local/bin/cvs-log /usr/adm/cvsroot-log
     ^prog1          Mail -s %s ceder

   The shell-script `/usr/local/bin/cvs-log' looks like this:

     #!/bin/sh
     (echo "------------------------------------------------------";
      echo -n $2"  ";
      date;
      echo;
      cat) >> $1

Keeping a checked out copy
--------------------------

   It is often useful to maintain a directory tree which contains files
which correspond to the latest version in the repository.  For example,
other developers might want to refer to the latest sources without
having to check them out, or you might be maintaining a web site with
CVS and want every checkin to cause the files used by the web server to
be updated.

   The way to do this is by having loginfo invoke `cvs update'.  Doing
so in the naive way will cause a problem with locks, so the `cvs update'
must be run in the background.  Here is an example for unix (this
should all be on one line):

     ^cyclic-pages		(date; cat; (sleep 2; cd /u/www/local-docs;
      cvs -q update -d) &) >> $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/updatelog 2>&1

   This will cause checkins to repository directories starting with
`cyclic-pages' to update the checked out tree in `/u/www/local-docs'.

Rcsinfo
=======

   The `rcsinfo' file can be used to specify a form to edit when
filling out the commit log.  The `rcsinfo' file has a syntax similar to
the `verifymsg', `commitinfo' and `loginfo' files.  *Note syntax::.
Unlike the other files the second part is _not_ a command-line
template.  Instead, the part after the regular expression should be a
full pathname to a file containing the log message template.

   If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions
in this file, the `DEFAULT' line is used, if it is specified.

   All occurrences of the name `ALL' appearing as a regular expression
are used in addition to the first matching regular expression or
`DEFAULT'.

   The log message template will be used as a default log message.  If
you specify a log message with `cvs commit -m MESSAGE' or `cvs commit -f
FILE' that log message will override the template.

   *Note verifymsg::, for an example `rcsinfo' file.

   When CVS is accessing a remote repository, the contents of `rcsinfo'
at the time a directory is first checked out will specify a template
which does not then change.  If you edit `rcsinfo' or its templates,
you may need to check out a new working directory.
