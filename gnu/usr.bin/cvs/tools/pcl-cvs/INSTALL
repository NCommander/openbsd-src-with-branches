Installation of the pcl-cvs program
===================================

  1. Possibly edit the file `Makefile' to reflect the situation at your
     site.  We say "possibly" because the version of pcl-cvs included
     with CVS uses a configuration mechanism integrated with the overall
     mechanisms used by the CVS build and install procedures.  Thus the
     file `Makefile' will be generated automatically from the file
     `Makefile.in', and it should not be necessary to edit it further.

     If you do have to edit the `Makefile', the only things you have to
     change is the definition of `lispdir' and `infodir'.  The elisp
     files will be copied to `lispdir', and the info file(s) to
     `infodir'.

  2. Configure pcl-cvs.el

     There are a couple of pathnames that you have to check to make
     sure that they match your system.  They appear early in the file
     `pcl-cvs.el'.

     *NOTE:*  If your system is running emacs 18.57 or earlier you MUST
     uncomment the line that says:
          (setq delete-exited-processes nil)

     Setting `delete-exited-processes' to `nil' works around a bug in
     emacs that causes it to dump core.  The bug was fixed in emacs
     18.58.

  3. Release 1.05 and later of pcl-cvs requires parts of the Elib
     library, version 1.0 or later.  Elib is available via anonymous
     ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu in `pub/gnu/elib-1.0.tar.gz', and from a
     lot of other sites that mirror prep.  Get Elib, and install it,
     before proceeding.

     *NOTE:* The version of pcl-cvs included with CVS includes a copy
     of Elib in the sub-directory `elib' under the `contrib/elib'
     directory.

  4. Type `make install' in the source directory.  This will
     byte-compile all `.el' files and copy the `*.elc' files into the
     directory you specified in step 1.

     If you want to install the `*.el' files too, you can type `make
     install-el' to do so.

     If you only want to create the compiled elisp files, but don't
     want to install them, you can type `make' without parameters.

  5. Edit the file `default.el' in your emacs lisp directory (usually
     `/usr/gnu/lib/emacs/site-lisp' or something similar) and enter the
     contents of the file `pcl-cvs-startup.el' into it.  It contains a
     couple of `auto-load's that facilitates the use of pcl-cvs.


Installation of the on-line manual.
===================================

  1. Create the info file(s) `pcl-cvs.info*' from `pcl-cvs.texinfo' by
     typing `make info'.  If you don't have the program `makeinfo' you
     can get it by anonymous ftp from e.g. `prep.ai.mit.edu' as
     `pub/gnu/texinfo-3.7.tar.gz' (there might be a newer version there
     when you read this).

  2. Install the info file(s) `pcl-cvs.info*' into your standard `info'
     directory.  You should be able to do this by typing `make
     install-info'.

  3. Edit the file `dir' in the `info' directory and enter one line to
     contain a pointer to the info file(s) `pcl-cvs.info*'.  The line
     can, for instance, look like this:

          * Pcl-cvs: (pcl-cvs).           An Emacs front-end to CVS.

How to make typeset documentation from pcl-cvs.texinfo
======================================================

   If you have TeX installed at your site, you can make a typeset manual
from `pcl-cvs.texinfo'.

  1. Run TeX by typing ``make pcl-cvs.dvi''.  You will not get the
     indices unless you have the `texindex' program.

  2. Convert the resulting device independent file `pcl-cvs.dvi' to a
     form which your printer can output and print it.  If you have a
     postscript printer there is a program, `dvi2ps', which does.  There
     is also a program which comes together with TeX, `dvips', which
     you can use.
