Mon Apr 15 01:34:27 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

        * Makefile: removed.  Why was this in the repository in the first
        place?

        * Makefile.in (BATCHFLAGS): don't pass -q to Emacs when compiling,
        because Emacs probably can't find Elib's cookie.el[c] if we do
        that.  (Actually, it still can't, but that may be due to a bug in
        Emacs).

        * INSTALL: reflect changed location of elib in the CVS dist.

Sun Apr 14 12:18:12 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

        * pcl-cvs.el (cookie): Changed "(load \"cookie\")" to
        "(require 'cookie)", since elib is now included again.
        Moved "(provide 'pcl-cvs)" to the end of the file, so it's not
        provided if the package didn't load successfully.

        * Makefile.in (subdir): tools/pcl-cvs now, not contrib/pcl-cvs.
        (BATCHFLAGS): removed "-n" from BATCHFLAGS.  Emacs 19.30 does not
        know about this flag.
        (OBJDIR_DISTFILES): don't include .elc files here, add comment
        explaining why.

Thu Apr 11 20:22:34 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

        * pcl-cvs.el (cvs-mode-map): conform to Emacs 19 keybinding
        conventions by not binding any regular letters under C-c.

Fri Feb  9 14:29:07 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (mostlyclean clean realclean): Remove 'realclean'
	from this target list; it's already defined later in the file.

Tue Jan 23 13:02:24 1996  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* pcl-cvs.el (pcl-cvs-bugs-address): change the default address
	as suggested by Per Cederqvist.
	* pcl-cvs.el: removed comments refering to Signum, etc.

Sun Jan 21 12:51:12 1996  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-parse-stderr): fix typo (missing '\') that was
	causing occasional un-reported, un-traced, failures that simply
	said something like "RE missing '\(' or '\\('" -- hopefully this
	is the last such bug!

Tue Jan 16 13:57:16 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in: Rename "dist" target back to "dist-dir".  The
	latter is what actually gets used.
	(pcl-cvs.dvi): Restore srcdir to pcl-cvs.texinfo.  Fix typo
	(pcl-cvs.texifo -> pcl-cvs.texinfo).
	(TEXINDEX,TEX,SET_TEXINPUTS): New variables.
	(.el.elc): Copy .el file to build dir so .elc file gets put there.
	(dist-dir): Fix typo (cvs.info -> pcl-cvs.info).
	* cookie.el: New file, copied from elib 1.0.
	* README: Remove note about requiring elib; it claimed that CVS
	contained a copy of elib, but it lied.
	* pcl-cvs.el: Change (require 'cookie) to (load "cookie.el").
	* pcl-cvs-lucid.el: Change (require 'pcl-cvs) to (load "pcl-cvs.el").

Fri Jan 12 10:32:14 1996  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* pcl-cvs.elc, pcl-cvs-lucid.elc: removed

	* pcl-cvs.el: run through the spell checker...
	- noted some free variables in comments
	(cvs-inhibit-copyright-message): move this above
	cvs-startup-message to keep the compiler quiet

	* compile-all.el: removed (use make for dependency checking!)

	* Makefile.in: tweak various comments and echo messages...
	(elcfiles): removed this target.
	(.SUFFIXES, .el.elc): added support for elisp files.
	(CORE): new macro -- list of files all .elc depend on [still empty]
	(BATCHFLAGS): new macro -- flags to pass to emacs
	(OBJDIR_DISTFILES): added ELCFILES to be shipped in distribution

	* README: fix the RCS Id.

	* INSTALL: re-copy formatted makeinfo output from pcl-cvs.info,
	just to keep everything in proper synchronisation.

	* pcl-cvs.texinfo (Pcl-cvs installation): update to match Karl's
	new wording from INSTALL.

Wed Jan 10 22:04:35 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

        * INSTALL: make first item read a little more smoothly.

        * README: note that pcl-cvs has been tested under 19.30.

Wed Jan 10 17:59:00 1996  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* ChangeLog.woods: these are changes integrated in from my
	own pcl-cvs repository module, and based on the original PCL-CVS
	Version 1.05 release.  They include most, if not all, of the
	changes from the Cygnus and Cyclic CVS contrib versions of
	PCL-CVS (i.e. the changes noted below).

Sat Dec 30 15:01:45 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * pcl-cvs.el (cvs-changelog-ours-p): check that
        `add-log-full-name' and `add-log-mailing-address' are non-nil, in
        addition to checking that they are boundp.
        
Thu Dec 21 16:45:48 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@occs.cs.oberlin.edu>

        * pcl-cvs.el (cvs-parse-stderr): ignore kerberos connection
        failure, since CVS will automatically try rsh next.  I think this
        is okay because if a person needs to know that kerberos failed,
        then chances are the rsh failed too, and *that* error message will
        clue them in that something's afoot.

Wed Nov 22 11:01:50 1995  Joshua Cowan <jcowan@hermit.reslife.okstate.edu>

        * pcl-cvs.el (cvs-changelog-ours-p): use `user-full-name' if
        `add-log-full-name' unbound, as not every uses the stuff in
        add-log.el.  Same with `add-log-mailing-address'.
        (cvs-changelog-entries): change to `change-log-mode' unless
        already in it.

Sun Jul  9 20:57:11 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * "/bin/rmdir" as default, not "/usr/local/bin/rmdir".

Fri Jun 16 15:24:34 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@cyclic.com)

	* pcl-cvs.elc, pcl-cvs-lucid.elc: Added.

	* Makefile.in: Rename from Makefile and set srcdir.

	pcl-cvs.info.

	(DISTFILES): pcl-cvs removed; we handle the info files explicitly
	in the dist-dir target.

	* INSTALL: Updated.

	* README: Note that pcl-cvs has been tested under 19.28, and that
	the "cookie" naming conflict was resolved in 19.11.

	* Makefile (pcl-cvs-lucid.elc): Changed this target from
	pcl-cvs-lucid.el.  That's a source file, for goodness' sake!

Tue May  9 13:56:50 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* Change references to "Cygnus's remote CVS" to "Cyclic CVS".

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-parse-stderr): Handle colons after both

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-parse-stderr): Recognize "conflicts found in..."
	messages attributed to "cvs server", as well as "cvs update".

Sat Feb  4 01:47:01 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* pcl-cvs.el: Deal with the 'P' action, produced by remote CVS.
	(cvs-parse-stdout): Treat 'P' like 'U' --- file is updated.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-fileinfo->type): New type: REM-EXIST.
	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-shadow-entry-p): A REMOVED that follows a
	REM-EXIST is a shadow.

Tue Apr 27 00:48:40 1993  Per Cederqvist  (ceder@lysator.liu.se)

	defvar.

	  distribution. (It's included as elib/dll-debug.el).

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-mode): Document the "e" key (cvs-mode-emerge).

Tue Mar  9 00:02:57 1993  Per Cederqvist  (ceder@lysator.liu.se)

	  of elib in the future.

	* cookie.el: Use prefix cookie:: for internal functions.

	* cookie.el: (cookie:enter-after, cookie:enter-before,
	cookie:nth-cookie): Implemented.
	* cookie.el: No longer define (impl).

	* cookie.el: More renames:
	  cookie:next-cookie     -> cookie:goto-next-tin
	  cookie:previous-cookie -> cookie:goto-previous-tin
	  tin-next		 -> cookie:next-tin
	  tin-previous		 -> cookie:previous-tin

	functions (used instead of cookie:next-cookie and
	cookie:previous-cookie).

	* cookie.el: Major redesign. The handle that is passed to all
	cookie functions is now a new datatype, and not the buffer that
	the cookies resides in. This way it is possible to have more than
	one set of cookies in a buffer. Things that used to be
	buffer-local variables are now fields in the handle data type.
	cookie-last-tin is no longer available.
	* cookie.el (cookie:create): The buffer is not cleared, nor set to
	be read-only.
	* cookie.el (cookie:next-cookie, cookie:previous-cookie): Since
	the first argument is now a handle and not a buffer, these can no
	longer be called interactively. You have to write a small wrapper
	about them.

	  The commands that operate in the *cvs* buffer:
	      cvs-add-change-log-entry-other-window  -> cvs-mode-add-change-log-entry-other-window
              cvs-mark-all-files     	 -> cvs-mode-mark-all-files

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-update-running): New variable.

	cvs-buffer-name instead. (I no longer have any plans to allow more

	* pcl-cvs.texinfo (Customization): Document TMPDIR.

	* This chunk of modifications should make it possible to run
	pcl-cvs on hosts that do not line-buffer stdout (such as
	DECstation).  They work by diverting stdout and stderr from 
	`cvs update' and later sorting them together.
	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-parse-stderr): Don't fail to parse conflict

	separation of stderr and stdout.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-compare-fileinfos, cvs-parse-stderr,
	cvs-parse-stdout): New functions.

	from RCS 5.6.

	* Release 1.02.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-diff-backup, cvs-edit-done, cvs-status): Call
	save-some-buffers.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-diff-backup-extractor): Fixed syntax error.

	* Makefile, README, compile-all.el, dist-makefile, pcl-cvs.el,
	pcl-cvs.texinfo (XXRELEASEXX): A magic string that is substituted
	for the current release number when a distribution is made.
	(Release 1.01 says that it is release 1.00).

	Major rewrite of buffer and window selection and handling.  
	The *cvs* buffer is now killed whenever a new "cvs update" is
	initiated.  The -update buffer is replaced with the *cvs* 
	buffer when the update is completed.

Sat Mar 28 21:03:05 1992  Per Cederqvist  (ceder@robin)

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-delete-unused-temporary-buffers): Fixed it.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-auto-remove-handled): New variable.
	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-edit-done): Use it.
	* pcl-cvs.texinfo (Customization, Removing handled entries):
	Document it.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-mode): Turn of the undo feature.  It really
	isn't useful in a cookie buffer...

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-edit-done): Committing a file now looks more
	like diffing a file.  The window handling is better.
	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-use-temp-buffer): The &optional switch is no
	longer needed.

Mon Mar 23 00:20:33 1992  Per Cederqvist  (ceder@robin)

	* Release 0.97.

	* pcl-cvs.el (default-directory): Make sure it always ends in a
	slash. fileinfo->dir does NOT end in a slash, and I had forgotten
	to call	file-name-as-directory in various places.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-diff-backup-extractor): Signal an error if a
	fileinfo without backup file is given.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-mode): Added documentation.

	same directory.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-diff-backup): Filter non-backup-diffable files
	at an earlier stage, like cvs-commit does.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-diff-flags): New variable.
	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-diff-backup): Use it.
	* pcl-cvs.texinfo (Customization): Document it.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-execute-single-file-list): Remove &rest before
	last argument.  No callers needed updating.

	argument (constant-args).  Update all callers of cvs-execute-list
	to use the new calling convention.
	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-cvs-diff-flags): Now a list of strings instead
	of a string.
	* pcl-cvs.texinfo (Customization): Document the change to
	cvs-cvs-diff-flags.

	* pcl-cvs.texinfo (Customization, Viewing differences): Document it.

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-use-temp-buffe): Don't switch to the temporary
	buffer.  Use display-buffer and set-buffer instead.  This way
	cvs-log, cvs-status, cvs-diff-cvs and friends don't select the
	temporary buffer. The cursor will remain in the *cvs* buffer.

Sun Mar 22 21:50:18 1992  Per Cederqvist  (ceder@robin)

	* pcl-cvs.el (cvs-find-file, cvs-find-file-other-window): Don't
	prompt when reading in a directory in dired.

	* Makefile (pcl-cvs-$(VER)): Include pcl-cvs-startup.el in the
	distribution.

	* dist-makefile (pcl-cvs.dvi): Don't fail even if texindex does
	not exist.

	* pcl-cvs.texinfo (@setchapternewpage): Changed from 'off' to 'on'.
	* pcl-cvs.texinfo (Variable index): Joined into function index.
	* pcl-cvs.texinfo (Key index): add a description about the key.
	* pcl-cvs.texinfo: Many other small changes.

Wed Mar 18 01:58:38 1992  Per Cederqvist  (ceder@leopold)

	* Use GNU General Public License version 2.
