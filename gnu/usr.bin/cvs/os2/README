        This port requires IBM C/C++ and the IBM TCPIP library.
You'll need to edit the makefile to reflect your system's paths
(unless you're our customer for this port, in which case the paths
are correct because we did the port on your machine. :-) ).

        That should be all -- edit the makefile, do "make" and get
os2\cvs.exe.  Assuming you have edited the `install_dir' variable in
the Makefile, you may type "make install-cvs" to put cvs.exe in the
right place.

        If the makefile has linefeeds only at the end of lines, make
(at least the port of GNU make that I have) will interpret it
differently.  This is (IMHO) a bizarre behavior, but you need to
convert the linefeeds to CRLF pairs (editing the file with an editor
such as emacs will generally do this).

        You will get warnings during the compilation; ignore them.
