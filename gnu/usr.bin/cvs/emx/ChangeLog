	* rcmd.c: Removed; no longer used.
	* rcmd.h: Updated to have similar contents as
	windows-NT/rcmd.h.
	* Makefile.in (OS2_HEADERS): Change back to ${srcdir}/rcmd.h.
	That is the one that the -I options specify anyway.
	* startserver.c (os2_start_server): Pass a const char ** not
	a char ** to rcmd.

	* README: Replace text concerning warnings with a more
	specific list of exactly what the warnings are.  For the
	most part there should be no warnings.
	Update note about -lufc.
	* Makefile.in (LIB): Remove -lufc.
	* config.h (RSH_NOT_TRANSPARENT): Define.
	* Makefile.in: Use ${top_srcdir}/windows-NT/rcmd.* not our
	own rcmd.* (for better error messages).
	* .cvsignore: Add cvs.out.

Tue Jun 17 13:19:53 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Revise paragraph on -Zsys to discuss problem with
	sockets being missing.

Mon Jun 16 10:58:46 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Change bug submission address to include bug-cvs.
	Add paragraph (from the mail message of the submission) concerning
	HPFS and such.  Cosmetic changes (two spaces after periods for
	example).  Say that ufc-crypt shouldn't be needed currently.
	Add comment about emx.dll.
	* config.h, startserver.c, rcmd.h, rcmd.c, system.c: Add
	"copyright" notice.
	* system.c (os2_initialize): Add comment about whether we should
	be expanding wildcards here.  Cosmetic changes throughout
	(for example, reindenting just about everything).
	* system.c (xgetwd): Rewritten and renamed from os2_getwd.
	* config.h (CVS_GETWD, os2_getwd): Removed.
	* rcmd.c: Add comment about portable versus OS-specific
	implementations of this functionality.
	* config.h: Remove SIZEOF_INT, SIZEOF_LONG, HAVE_MKFIFO,
	HAVE_SETVBUF, and USE_DIRECT_TCP; no longer used.
	* config.h: Add USE_SETMODE_BINARY.
	* config.h: Define NO_EXT_METHOD.
	* Makefile.in (LIB_SOURCES): Remove lib/xgetwd.c; replaced by
	xgetwd in system.c.
	(LIB_OBJECTS): Likewise, remove lib/xgetwd.o.
	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add missing "/".
	* .cvsignore: Added.

	* New directory.  This consists of the port that Thomas Epting
	sent to bug-cvs on 18 Mar 97.  He also sent some diffs which go
	with this; I'll subsequently be checking in some of those diffs
	and my various tweaks to the code.
