Welcome to CVS!

Bug reports are accepted, however note that someone may or may not
feel like taking care of your bug report.  Support contracts are
available from Cyclic Software (http://www.cyclic.com or
info@cyclic.com).

To report bugs send mail to bug-cvs@prep.ai.mit.edu, or run the "cvsbug"
program and fill out the template:

	$ cvsbug

The "cvsbug" program is installed in the same location as the "cvs"
program.  If your installation failed, you may need to run "cvsbug"
directly out of the "src" directory as "src/cvsbug.sh".  This is also
the procedure for submitting suggested changes to CVS (see the file
HACKING for more details).  Note that all submitted changes may be
distributed under the terms of the GNU Public License, so if you don't
like this, don't submit them.

Please consult the INSTALL file for information on tested
configurations.  If you have a comment about an already tested
configuration, or have tried CVS on a new configuration, please write
to the above address and let us know!  Free software only works if we
all help out.

Finally, we cannot guarantee that this release will not completely wipe out
all of your work from your system.  We do some simple testing before each
release, but you are completely on your own.  We recommend testing this
release on a source repository that is not critical to your work.  THIS
SOFTWARE IS SUPPLIED COMPLETELY "AS IS".  NO WARRANTY....

Thanks for your support!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CVS is a freely available collection of programs that provide for software
release and revision control functions in a UNIX environment.  It is
designed to work on top of the RCS distribution, V4 and later.  CVS does
understand how to parse older RCS formats, but cannot do any of the fancier
features (like vendor branch support) without RCS branch support.

Short blurb from the manual page (larger blurb is included there):
     cvs is a front end to the  rcs(1)  revision  control  system
     which  extends the notion of revision control from a collec-
     tion of files in a single directory to a  hierarchical  col-
     lection  of  directories  consisting  of revision controlled
     files.  These directories and files can be combined together
     to  form  a  software  release.   cvs provides the functions
     necessary to manage these software releases and  to  control
     the  concurrent  editing  of  source  files  among  multiple
     software developers.

And a whole lot more.  See the doc/cvs.texinfo file for more information.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes to people upgrading from a previous release of CVS:

See the NEWS file for a description of features new in this version.

The repository format is compatible going back to CVS 1.3.  But see
the "Watches compatibility" section of doc/cvs.texinfo if you have
copies of CVS 1.6 or older and you want to use the optional developer
communication features.

The working directory format is compatible going back to CVS 1.5.  It
did change between CVS 1.3 and CVS 1.5.  If you run CVS 1.5 or newer
on a working directory checked out with CVS 1.3, CVS will convert it,
but to go back to CVS 1.3 you need to check out a new working
directory with CVS 1.3.

The remote protocol is interoperable going back to CVS 1.5.  Using a
client or server older than 1.5 is deprecated and may fail to work at
some point in the future (1.5 was the first official release with the
remote protocol, but some older versions might still be floating
around).  In many cases you need to upgrade both the client and the
server to take advantage of new features and bugfixes, however.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation:

Please read the INSTALL file for installation instructions.  Brief summary:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make check	# optional, long-running, step
	$ make install
	$ cvsinit

The documentation is in the doc subdirectory.  cvs.texinfo is the main
manual; cvs.info* and cvs.ps are the info and postscript versions,
respectively, generated from cvs.texinfo.  The postscript version is
for A4 paper; if you want US letter size, you need to remove the line
@afourpaper from cvs.texinfo and re-generate cvs.ps using TeX.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* How do I get up-to-date information and information about other
versions of CVS?

On the web, http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs-index.html.

The mailing list for CVS is info-cvs@prep.ai.mit.edu.  Send
subscription and removal requests for that list to
info-cvs-request@prep.ai.mit.edu.

The newsgroup for CVS (and other configuration management systems) is
comp.software.config-mgmt.  There is not yet a CVS-specific newsgroup,
but perhaps if comp.software.config-mgmt gets enough CVS discussion,
then it will be possible to create one.

Credits:

The conflict-resolution algorithms and much of the administrative file
definitions of CVS were based on the original package written by Dick Grune
at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam <dick@cs.vu.nl>, and posted to
comp.sources.unix in the volume 6 release sometime in 1986.  This original
version was a collection of shell scripts.  I am thankful that Dick made
his work available.

Brian Berliner from Prisma, Inc. (now at Sun Microsystems, Inc.)
<berliner@sun.com> converted the original CVS shell scripts into reasonably
fast C and added many, many features to support software release control
functions.  See the manual page in the "man" directory.  A copy of the
USENIX article presented at the Winter 1990 USENIX Conference, Washington
D.C., is included in the "doc" directory.

Jeff Polk from BSDI <polk@bsdi.com> converted the CVS 1.2
sources into much more readable and maintainable C code.  He also added a
whole lot of functionality and modularity to the code in the process.
See the ChangeLog file.

david d `zoo' zuhn <zoo@armadillo.com> contributed the working base code
for CVS 1.4 Alpha.  His work carries on from work done by K. Richard Pixley
and others at Cygnus Support.  The CVS 1.4 upgrade is due in large part to
Zoo's efforts.

David G. Grubbs <dgg@odi.com> contributed the CVS "history" and "release"
commands.  As well as the ever-so-useful "-n" option of CVS which tells CVS
to show what it would do, without actually doing it.  He also contributed
support for the .cvsignore file.

The Free Software Foundation (GNU) contributed most of the portability
framework that CVS now uses.  This can be found in the "configure" script,
the Makefile's, and basically most of the "lib" directory.

K. Richard Pixley, Cygnus Support <rich@cygnus.com> contributed many bug
fixes/enhancement as well as completing early reviews of the CVS 1.3 manual
pages.

Roland Pesch, then of Cygnus Support <roland@wrs.com> contributed brand new
cvs(1) and cvs(5) manual pages.  We should all thank him for saving us from
my poor use of our language!

Paul Sander, HaL Computer Systems, Inc. <paul@hal.com> wrote and
contributed the code in lib/sighandle.c.  I added support for POSIX, BSD,
and non-POSIX/non-BSD systems.

Jim Kingdon and others at Cygnus Support <info@cygnus.com> wrote the
remote repository access code.

In addition to the above contributors, the following Beta testers deserve
special mention for their support.  If I have left off your name, I
apologize.  Just write to me and let me know!

Many contributors have added code to the "contrib" directory.  See the
README file there for a list of what is available.  There is also a
contributed GNU Emacs CVS-mode in contrib/pcl-cvs.
