\\[cvs-mode-commit]   Commit file.                \\[cvs-mode-update-no-prompt]   Reupdate directory.
\\[cvs-mode-mark]   Mark file/dir.              \\[cvs-mode-unmark]   Unmark file/dir.
\\[cvs-mode-mark-all-files]   Mark all files.             \\[cvs-mode-unmark-all-files]   Unmark all files.
\\[cvs-mode-find-file]   Edit file/run Dired.        \\[cvs-mode-find-file-other-window]   Find file or run Dired in other window.
\\[cvs-mode-remove-handled]   Remove processed entries.   \\[cvs-mode-add-change-log-entry-other-window]   Write ChangeLog in other window.
\\[cvs-mode-add]   Add to repository.          \\[cvs-mode-remove-file]   Remove file.
\\[cvs-mode-diff-cvs]   Diff between base revision. \\[cvs-mode-diff-backup]   Diff backup file.
\\[cvs-mode-emerge]   Run emerge on base revision/backup file.
\\[cvs-mode-acknowledge] Delete line from buffer.    \\[cvs-mode-ignore]   Add file to the .cvsignore file.
\\[cvs-mode-log]   Run ``cvs log''.            \\[cvs-mode-status]   Run ``cvs status''.
\\[cvs-mode-changelog-commit]  Like \\[cvs-mode-commit], but get default log text from ChangeLog.
\\[cvs-mode-undo-local-changes]  Revert the last checked in version - discard your changes to the file.

Ask the user for a log message in a buffer.

This is just like `\\[cvs-mode-commit]', except that it tries to provide
appropriate default log messages by looking at the ChangeLogs.  The
idea is to write your ChangeLog entries first, and then use this
command to commit your changes.

To select default log text, we:
- find the ChangeLogs for the files to be checked in,
- verify that the top entry in the ChangeLog is on the current date
  and by the current user; if not, we don't provide any default text,
- search the ChangeLog entry for paragraphs containing the names of
  the files we're checking in, and finally
- use those paragraphs as the log text."
