        Elib is included in the CVS distribution as a convenience
only, because pcl-cvs needs elib to run (see tools/pcl-cvs/).  The
maintainers of CVS do not maintain elib, so please do not send them
bug reports about elib.

        As of 14 April 1996, the latest release of elib can be found
at "ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/emacs/elib-1.0.tar.gz".
