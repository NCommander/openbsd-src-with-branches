17 May 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* listen2.c: Failed attempt at making this do what it was
	intended to do.  Will need to rethink the approach.
	* listen2.mak: The usual involuntary tweaks.
	* .cvsignore: Add listen2.ncb listen2.mdp.

Mon May 12 11:59:23 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* listener.c: Removed; see ../ChangeLog for rationale.

10 May 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* listen2.c, listen2.mak: New files.
	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add them.
	* .cvsignore: Add Debug.

Thu Feb 20 22:43:45 1997  David J MacKenzie  <djm@va.pubnix.com>

	* rcs-to-cvs.sh: Put temporary files in /var/tmp or /usr/tmp
	whichever one exists.  Just call "vi" not "/usr/ucb/vi".

Mon Feb 17 08:51:37 1997  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* .cvsignore: added 'cvs2vendor' target from Feb. 12 changes.

	* log_accum.pl (build_header): added "Repository:" to the report
	header to show the first argument supplied to the script by CVS.
	[[this value seems spuriously to be wrong when client is used]]
	($hostdomain): correct order of initialization from the Feb. 12
	changes.
	($modulename): add more commentary about using '-M' to to get a
	meaningful string here.
	Tweak a few other comments from the Feb. 12 changes.

Wed Feb 12 10:27:48 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cln_hist.pl, commit_prep.pl, cvs2vendor.sh, cvs_acls.pl,
	cvscheck.man, cvscheck.sh, cvshelp.man, descend.man, descend.sh,
	log_accum.pl, mfpipe.pl, rcs-to-cvs.sh, rcs2log.sh, rcs2sccs.sh,
	sccs2rcs.csh: Remove $Id; we decided to get rid of these some
	time ago.

Wed Feb 12 00:24:33 1997  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* cvs2vendor.sh: new script.
	* README: noted new cvs2vendor script.
	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): added cvs2vendor.sh.
	(CONTRIB_PROGS): added cvs2vendor.

	* log_accum.pl (show_wd): new variable, initialized to 0.
	- set $show_wd if '-w' option found while parsing @ARGV.
	- don't add 'In directory' line to report header unless $show_wd
	is set.
	(domainname): prepend a leading '.' if none there so that
	concatenation with $hostname works (those with a FQDN hostname
	*and* a domainname still lose).
	(mail_notification): don't set a "From:" header -- the mailer will.

Wed Jan  8 14:48:58 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in, README, log.pl: Remove CVSid; we decided to get rid
	of these some time ago.

Thu Jan  2 13:30:56 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in: Remove "675" paragraph; see ../ChangeLog for rationale.

Thu Oct 17 18:28:25 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* patch-2.1-.new-fix: Removed; it was not in DISTFILES so it never
	made it into distributions.  It also isn't clear what it has to do
	with CVS.  It is available from
	    ftp://ftp.weird.com/pub/patch-2.1-.new-fix
	* README: Remove entry for patch-2.1-.new-fix.

Wed Oct 16 10:22:44 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* rcs2log.sh: Change date output format to something CVS 1.9
 	accepts.  I think this breaks the Sep 29 change, but I don't have
 	a copy of CVS 1.5 handy, so I can't find a format that works with
 	both, and I think it's more important that it work with the
 	version it's distributed with.

Sat Oct 12 21:18:19 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Don't mention pcl-cvs; it isn't here any more.

Sun Sep 29 19:45:19 1996  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* README: re-write the top section a bit.

	* patch-2.1-.new-fix: re-generated using fixed "cvs patch" command.

	* patch-2.1-.new-fix: new file.

Sun Sep 29 14:25:28 1996  Dave Love  <d.love@dl.ac.uk>

	* rcs2log.sh (month_data):  Make default date format acceptable to
 	CVS post v1.8 as well as earlier CVSs and RCS.
	Message-Id: <199609291546.QAA25531@mserv1.dl.ac.uk>
	To: bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu

Thu Aug 29 11:58:03 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* rcs2log: Update FSF address.

	* rcs2log: Be more aggressive about finding the author's full
	name; try nismatch and ypmatch.

	* rcs2log: If the hostname appears not to be fully qualified, see
 	if domainname provides any useful information.

Fri Aug 16 16:02:36 1996  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* Makefile.in (installdirs): support this target

Mon May  6 13:04:57 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (install): Don't tell user to run cvsinit.  It isn't
	called cvsinit anymore, and it isn't necessary (repositories are,
	and need to be, compatible between cvs versions).

Sun Apr 14 11:30:36 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

        * Removed pcl-cvs/ subdir; see tools/ subdir in the top-level from
        now on.
        Added elib/ subdir.
        
        * Makefile.in (dist-dir): Removed all references to pcl-cvs/
        subdir.

Wed Mar  6 10:20:28 1996  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* log_accum.pl: ($MAILER): use sendmail directly to allow other
	headers to be included
	* log_accum.pl (mail_notification): add support to allow settting
	of Reply-To and Date header fields in the sent mail; remove $mailto
	argument and use the global variable (as with $replyto).
	* log_accum.pl: add -R option for mail_notification()'s optional
	Reply-To value [default to $login]

Fri Mar  1 01:51:56 1996  Benjamin J. Lee  <benjamin@cyclic.com>

	* listener.c: added as mentioned in ../README.VMS

Mon Feb 19 13:37:36 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Don't just tell people "we don't want your script"; tell
	them what to do instead.

Thu Feb  1 14:28:16 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

        * Makefile.in (DISTFILES): added `rcs2sccs.sh', as mentioned in
        README.

Thu Jan 18 09:39:16 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Talk about submitting changes to contrib directory.

	* README: fix some spelling and other typos

	* Makefile.in: if I need reminding to run cvsinit....

Tue Nov 14 13:47:40 1995  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* log_accum.pl:
	- Fix 'cvs status' to use global -Qq options
	- fix up a couple of comments, incl., my proper address

	* log.pl: add a CVSid and fix a couple of comments

Sun Oct  1 02:02:57 1995  Peter Wemm  <peter@haywire.dialix.com>

	* Makefile.in: supply a suffix rule to deal with .sh "source"

Sat Jul 29 17:29:13 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* log.pl: Use global options -Qq, not command options -Qq.

	* Makefile.in (install): Look for $(PROGS) and
	$(CONTRIB_PROGS) in build dir, not srcdir.

Fri Jul 28 19:48:45 1995  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* rcs2log.sh: Sync with latest Emacs snapshot.

Thu Jul 27 20:29:30 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* rcs2log.sh: import of initial WNT port work

Fri Jul 14 22:38:44 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* rcs-to-cvs.sh: Changes from David J. Mackenzie.
	Set permissions on new repository files correctly.
	Ignore *~ files.

Thu Jul 13 23:04:12 CDT 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Makefile.in (.pl, .csh): *Never* redirect output directly to
	the target (usu $@) of a rule.  Instead, redirect to a temporary
	file, and then move that temporary to the target.  I chose to
	name temporary files $@-t.  Remember to be careful that the length
	of the temporary file name not exceed the 14-character limit.

Sun Jul  9 21:16:53 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        These are actually Greg Woods' changes:
        
        * clmerge.pl, cvscheck.sh, descend.sh, dirfns.shar, rcs-to-cvs.sh,
        rcs2log.sh, sccs2rcs.csh: renamed from the corresponding files
        sans extensions.
        
        * rcs2sccs.sh: new file.

Sun Jul  9 19:03:00 1995  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>
        
        * rcs2log.sh: oops, one more thing that should not have been
        there.
        - fix interpreter file syntax.
        - remove "fix" for separating filenames and comments

	* Makefile.in: hmm... thought rcs2log was in RCS-5.7 for some
        reason -- it's not, so we'll install it from here....
        - fix typo -- that's what you get for re-doing changes by hand!
        - updates to support proper transformation and installation of
        renamed files (from previous local changes)

	* .cvsignore: one more target noted...

	- set up the interpreter file for updating by Makefile
	(from previous local changes)
	- include changes from 1.5 here too, if any

	* README:
	- remove extensions from filenames to match installed names
	(from previous local changes)

	* .cvsignore: - added $(CONTRIB_PROGS) (from previous local changes)

	* Makefile.in (distclean): Also remove pcl-cvs/Makefile.

	* intro.doc: Added.
	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add intro.doc.

Sat May 27 08:46:00 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Makefile.in (Makefile): Regenerate only Makefile in current
	directory when Makefile.in is out of date.  Depend on ../config.status.

Mon May  8 13:06:29 1995  Bryan O'Sullivan  <bos@serpentine.com>

	* README: added an entry for ccvs-rsh.pl.

Sun Apr 30 23:50:32 1995  Bryan O'Sullivan  <bos@serpentine.com>

	from parent.

Mon Feb 13 13:32:07 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* rcs2log: rcs2log was originally in this tree; how did it get
	deleted?  Anyway, this is the version distributed with Emacs
	19.28, hacked to support CVS and Remote CVS.

Mon Jul 26 13:18:23 1993  David J. Mackenzie  (djm@thepub.cygnus.com)
