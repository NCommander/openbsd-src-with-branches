Mon Oct  2 18:11:23 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* system.h: Doc fix.

Mon Oct  2 18:10:35 1995  Larry Jones  <larry.jones@sdrc.com>

	* regex.c: compile 4.2 BSD compatible functions even when
	_POSIX_SOURCE is defined since we need them and we wouldn't be
	compiling this file unless they don't exist.

Mon Oct  2 10:32:20 1995  Michael Finken  <finken@conware.de>

        * strstr.c (strstr): new file and func.

        * Makefile.in (SOURCES): added strstr.c.

Sun Oct  1 21:03:40 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@totoro.cyclic.com>

        * regex.c: reverted below change.

Thu Sep 28 13:37:04 1995  Larry Jones <larry.jones@sdrc.com>
        
        * regexp.c: check for ISC.
        
Thu Sep 7  19:18:00 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@cyclic.com>

	* save-cwd.c: #include <direct.h> and <io.h>, on systems that
	have them.

	* getopt.c (_getopt_internal): Cast the return value of strlen,
	which is unsigned, before comparing it with the difference between
	two pointers, which is unsigned.

Thu Aug 31 11:31:42 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* getdate.y [STDC_HEADERS]: #include <stdlib.h>, for abort.
	[HAVE_ALLOCA_H]: #include <alloca.h>, for alloca on Windows NT.

Wed Aug 30 18:48:44 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* system.h [HAVE_IO_H]: #include <io.h>, for Windows NT.
	[HAVE_DIRECT_H]: #include <direct.h>, for Windows NT.
	(CVS_MKDIR, FOLD_FN_CHAR, fnfold, fncmp, ISDIRSEP, OPEN_BINARY,
	FOPEN_BINARY_READ, FOPEN_BINARY_WRITE): New macros/functions, for
	use in system-sensitive code.

	* regex.c (re_set_registers): start and end are pointers, not
	integers.  Cast the initializing value appropriately.

	* getopt.c [HAVE_STRING_H]: #include <string.h>, to avoid
	warnings.

	* fnmatch.c (FOLD_FN_CHAR): Give this a dummy #definition if
	config.h didn't #define it.
        (fnmatch): Pass filename characters through FOLD_FN_CHAR before
	comparing them.

	* argmatch.c: #include <sys/types.h>.
	(argmatch): Declare arglen to be a size_t, rather than an int,
	to avoid signed/unsigned comparison "problems".

	* .cvsignore: Remove getdate.c from this file.  We want to
	distribute it, for systems that don't have a Yacc-equivalent
	installed (like Windows NT).

Sat Aug 19 22:00:51 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* error.c: Don't #define CVS_SUPPORT here.  config.h takes care of
	that for us.
	[CVS_SUPPORT] (error_use_protocol): New variable, with apology.
	(error): If error_use_protocol is set, report errors using the
	client/server protocol.
	* error.h [CVS_SUPPORT]: Extern decl for error_use_protocol.

Fri Aug  4 00:01:24 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* xgetwd.c: Don't declare free.  A K&R style declaration gets
	a conflict on some Sun systems when compiling with acc.

	* save-cwd.c: New file.
	* save-cwd.h: New file.
	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Add save-cwd.c
	(OBJECTS): Add save-cwd.o.
	(HEADERS): Add save-cwd.h.

Thu Aug  3 00:55:54 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* error.h: New file.
	* Makefile.in (HEADERS): Add error.h.

Sat Jul 29 15:53:55 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Add getdate.c.

Thu Jul 27 09:11:41 1995  Robert Lipe <robertl@rjlhome.arnet.com>

	* system.h: Check for PATHSIZE before falling back to _POSIX_PATH_MAX.

Thu Jul 20 12:38:03 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* error.c: Instead of calling cvs functions to clean up, allow cvs
	to register a callback via error_set_cleanup.  Avoids hassles with
	include files and SERVER_SUPPORT and so on.

Tue Jul 18 21:18:00 1995  Jim Blandy <jimb@cyclic.com>

	* system.h: Include <sys/param.h> only if HAVE_SYS_PARAM_H
	is #defined.  We've added a test to configure.in to #define this
	on most systems.

Thu Jul 13 11:22:21 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* xgetwd.c: New file.
	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Add xgetwd.c
	(OBJECTS): Add xgetwd.o.

Wed Jul 12 09:18:49 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Makefile.in (OBJECTS): Remove fnmatch.o.  Now configure adds it
	to LIBOBJS when necessary.

Fri Jun 30 16:27:18 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* rename.c (rename): If MVDIR is not defined, just give an error
	on attempt to rename a directory.

Thu Jun 29 00:46:31 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* system.h: Check HAVE_SYS_TIMEB_H not non-existent HAVE_TIMEB_H.

	* system.h: Don't define alloca if it is already defined.

Wed Jun 28 15:24:51 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* system.h: If NeXT, define utimbuf ourself.

Mon May 29 22:32:40 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* system.h: Handle time and directory headers as recommended in
	the autoconf manual.
	Undefine the S_FOO() macros if STAT_MACROS_BROKEN is set.
	Don't define mode_t, as it is handled by config.h.

Sat May 27 08:46:00 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Makefile.in (Makefile): Regenerate only Makefile in current
	directory when Makefile.in is out of date.  Depend on ../config.status.

Fri Apr 28 22:49:25 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* Makefile.in (SOURCES, OBJECTS): Updated.
	(HEADERS): New variable.
	(DISTFILES): Updated.
	(dist-dir): Renamed from dist; changed to work with DISTDIR
	variable passed from parent.

Wed Feb  8 06:37:53 1995  Roland McGrath  <roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* system.h (S_IRUSR et al): Define if not already defined.

	* waitpid.c [HAVE_CONFIG_H]: Include "config.h".
	(ualloc): Return OLDPTR rather than running off the end.

Mon Aug 22 22:48:19 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@kr-pc.cygnus.com)

	* error.c (strerror): Replaced conditional static definition
	(always used, since the condition variable was never set) with an
	extern declaration, since it's provided by libc or strerror.c.

Wed Aug 10 14:54:25 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Add waitpid.c.
	* waitpid.c: New file.

Tue Aug  9 16:00:12 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* md5.h (uint32): If SIZEOF_LONG isn't 4, don't define this to be
	"unsigned long"; try SIZEOF_INT and "unsigned int", otherwise
	complain.

	* md5.c: Include config.h.
	(const): Don't bother defining here, config.h should take care of
	it.

	* valloc.c (malloc): Declare.

Fri Jul 15 12:57:20 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@sanguine.cygnus.com)

	* getopt.c: Do not include <stdlib.h> unless __GNU_LIBRARY__ is
	defined.  On Irix 5.2, <stdlib.h> includes <getopt.h>, which
	causes a multiple definition of struct option.

Fri Jul  8 10:04:59 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* md5.h, md5.c: Remove ANSI-isms.

Thu Jul  7 20:24:18 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@sanguine.cygnus.com)

	* md5.h, md5.c: New files.
	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Add md5.c.
	(OBJECTS): Add md5.o.
	(DISTFILES): Add md5.h.
	(md5.o): New target; depend upon md5.h.

Fri May 27 18:15:34 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* valloc.c: New file.

Tue May 17 08:18:26 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* error.c (error, fperror): If server_active, call server_cleanup
	as well as Lock_Cleanup.

Thu Jan  6 13:45:04 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* system.h: Fix Dec 27 change to work correctly.  Makes Sep 9
	change unnecessary, so backed that one out.  Never define PATH_MAX
	in terms of pathconf, because that doesn't produce a constant, and
	PATH_MAX is used to set array sizes.

Mon Dec 27 14:22:07 1993  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* system.h: don't touch PATH_MAX or MAXPATHLEN if *both* of them
	are already defined, as one may be defined in terms of the other.
