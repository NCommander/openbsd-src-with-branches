	* release.c (release): Revise comment regarding why and how we
	skip argv[0].

Mon Sep 11 10:03:59 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

Fri Sep  8 13:25:55 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* sanity.sh: When committing a removal, send stdout to LOGFILE;
	this is no longer a silent operation.

        * ALL FILES: add semicolon, as indicated below.
        
        * cvs.h (USE): don't provide semicolon in the expansion of the USE
        macro; we'd rather the callers provided it themselves because that

Wed Aug 30 12:36:37 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* sanity.sh (basic1): Make sure first-dir is deleted before
	running this set of tests.

        * subr.c: Extract file twiddling functions to a different file,
	because we want to use different versions of many of these
	routines under Windows NT.
	(copy_file, isdir, islink, isfile, isreadable, iswritable,
	open_file, make_directory, make_directories, xchmod,
	rename_file, link_file, unlink_file, xcmp, tmpnam,
	unlink_file_dir, deep_remove_dir): Moved to...
	* filesubr.c: ...this file, which is new.
	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Mention filesubr.c.
	(COMMON_OBJECTS): Mention filesubr.o.

	* subr.c: Extract process execution guts to a different file,
	because we want to replace these routines entirely under
	Windows NT.
	(VA_START, va_alist, va_dcl): Move this stuff...
	(run_add_arg, run_init_prog): and these declarations...
	(run_prog, run_argv, run_argc, run_argc_allocated): and these
	variables...
	(run_setup, run_arg, run_args, run_add_arg, run_init_prog,
	run_exec, run_print, Popen): and these functions...
	* run.c: To this file, which is new.
	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Mention run.c.
	(COMMON_OBJECTS): Mention run.o.

	* status.c (status): Call ign_setup, if client_active.  Otherwise,
	we don't end up ignoring CVS directories and such.

	* server.c (mkdir_p, dirswitch): Use CVS_MKDIR instead of mkdir.

	* repos.c (Name_Repository): Use the isabsolute function instead of
	checking the first character of the path.
	* root.c (Name_Root): Same.

	* release.c (release): Use fncmp instead of strcmp to compare
	filenames.

	* rcs.c (RCS_parse, RCS_parsercsfile) [LINES_CRLF_TERMINATED]:
	Abort, because we have strong reason to believe this code is
	wrong.

	* patch.c (patch): Register signal handlers iff the signal name is
	#defined.

	* no_diff.c (No_Difference): Don't try to include server_active in
	trace message unless SERVER_SUPPORT is #defined.

	* modules.c (do_module): Use CVS_MKDIR instead of mkdir.

	* mkmodules.c (main): Call last_component instead of writing it out.

	* main.c (main): Call last_component instead of writing it out.
	Break up the long copyright string into several strings; Microsoft
	Visual C++ can't handle a line that long.  Feh.
	Use fncmp instead of strcmp to compare filenames.
	Register signal handlers iff the signal name is #defined.

	* lock.c (readers_exist): Don't check return value of closedir.
	Most of the rest of the code doesn't, and some systems don't
	provide a return value anyway.
	(set_lock): Use CVS_MKDIR instead of mkdir.

	* import.c (import): Use the isabsolute function instead of
	checking the first character of the path.
	Try to delete the temporary file again after we close it, so it'll
	get deleted on systems that don't let you delete files that are
	open.
	(add_rev): Instead of making a hard link to the working file and
	checking in the revision with ci -r, use ci -u and restore the
	permission bits.
	(comtable): Include lines from SYSTEM_COMMENT_TABLE, if it is
	#defined.
	(add_rcs_file) [LINES_CRLF_TERMINATED]: Abort, because we have
	strong reason to believe this code is wrong.

	* history.c (read_hrecs): Open the file with OPEN_BINARY.

	* find_names.c (add_entries_proc, fsortcmp): Add prototypes.
	* entries.c (write_ent_proc): Add prototype.
	* hash.c (walklist): Add prototype for PROC argument.
	(sortlist): Add prototype for COMP argument.
	(printnode): Add a prototype, and make it static.

	* cvs.h (wrap_add_file, wrap_add): Add extern decls for these;
	they're used in import.c and update.c.
	* wrapper.c (wrap_add_file, wrap_add): Remove them from here.

	* cvs.h (RUN_NORMAL, RUN_COMBINED, RUN_REALLY, RUN_STDOUT_APPEND,
	RUN_STDERR_APPEND, RUN_SIGNIGNORE, RUN_TTY, run_arg, run_print,
	run_setup, run_args, run_exec, Popen, piped_child, close_on_exec,
	filter_stream_through_program, waitpid): Move all these
	declarations and definitions to the same section.

	* cvs.h (error_set_cleanup): Fix prototype.

	* cvs.h (isabsolute, last_component): New extern decls.

	* cvs.h (link_file): Function is deleted; remove extern decl.

	* cvs.h (DEATH_STATE, DEATH_SUPPORT): Move #definitions of these
	above the point where we #include rcs.h, since rcs.h tests them
	(or DEATH_SUPPORT, at least).

	* cvs.h (DEVNULL): #define this iff it isn't already #defined.
	config.h may want to override it.

	* cvs.h (SERVER_SUPPORT, CLIENT_SUPPORT): Don't #define these
	here; let config.h do that.  On some systems, we don't have any
	server support.

	* cvs.h: Don't #include <io.h> or <direct.h>; we take care of
	those in lib/system.h.

	* commit.c (commit): Open logfile with the OPEN_BINARY flag.
	(precommit_proc): Use the isabsolute function, instead of
	comparing the first character with /.
	(remove_file, checkaddfile): Use CVS_MKDIR instead of mkdir.

        * client.c (send_repository): Use larger line buffers.

        * client.c [LINES_CRLF_TERMINATED] (update_entries): If we've just
	received a gzipped file, copy it over, converting LF to CRLF,
	instead of just renaming it into place.
	[LINES_CRLF_TERMINATED] (send_modified): Convert file to LF format
	before sending with gzip.
	(send_modified): Don't be disturbed if we get fewer than
	sb.st_size characters when we read.  The read function may be
	collapsing CRLF to LF for us.

	* client.c: Add forward declarations for all the cvs command
	functions we call.

	* client.c: Add forward static declarations for all the
	handle_mumble functions.

	On some systems, RSH converts LF to CRLF; this screws us up.
	* client.c (rsh_pid): Declare this iff RSH_NOT_TRANSPARENT is not
	#defined.
	(get_responses_and_close): Use SHUTDOWN_SERVER if it is #defined.
	Only wait for rsh process to exit if RSH_NOT_TRANSPARENT is not
	#defined.
	(start_rsh_server): Declare and define only if
	RSH_NOT_TRANSPARENT is not #defined.  Use piped_child, instead of
	writing all that out.
	(start_server): Only try to call start_rsh_server if
	RSH_NOT_TRANSPARENT is not #defined.  Use START_SERVER if it is
	#defined.  Convert file descriptors to stdio file pointers using
	the FOPEN_BINARY_WRITE and FOPEN_BINARY_READ strings.

	* client.h (rsh_pid): Don't declare this; it's never used elsewhere.
	(supported_request): Add external declaration for this;
	it's used in checkout.c.

	Move process-running functions to run.c; we need to totally
	replace these on other systems, like Windows NT.
	* client.c (close_on_exec, filter_stream_through_program): Moved
	to run.c.
	* run.c (close_on_exec, filter_stream_through_program): Here they
	are.

	* add.c (add_directory): Use CVS_MKDIR instead of straight mkdir.
	* checkout.c (checkout, build_dirs_and_chdir): Same.
	(checkout_proc): Use fncmp instead of strcmp.
	* client.c (call_in_directory): Use CVS_MKDIR instead of straight
	mkdir.

	* client.c (handle_checksum): Cast return value of strtol.

Wed Aug 30 10:35:46 1995  Stefan Monnier <stefan.monnier@epfl.ch>

        * main.c (main): Allow -d to override CVSROOT_ENV.

Thu Aug 24 18:57:49 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.h, rcscmds.c (RCS_unlock, RCS_deltag, RCS_lock): Add extra
	parameter for whether to direct stderr to DEVNULL.
	* checkin.c, tag.c, rtag.c, import.c, commit.c: Pass extra
	argument.  1 if stderr had been directed to DEVNULL before
	rcscmds.c was in use, 0 if it was RUN_TTY.

	* cvs.h: Add comment regarding attic.

Tue Aug 22 10:09:29 1995  Alexander Dupuy  <dupuy@smarts.com>

	* rcs.c (whitespace): Cast to unsigned char in case char is signed
	and value is negative.

Tue Aug 22 10:09:29 1995  Kirby Koster  <koster@sctc.com>
			  and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* update.c (join_file): If vers->vn_user is NULL, just return.

Tue Aug 22 10:09:29 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* server.c, client.c: Add comments about modes and umasks.

Mon Aug 21 12:54:14 1995  Rick Sladkey  <jrs@world.std.com>

	* update.c (update_filesdone_proc): If pipeout, don't try to
	create CVS/Root.

Mon Aug 21 12:54:14 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* client.c (start_rsh_server): Don't pass -d to "cvs server"
	invocation via rsh.

	* server.c (serve_root): Report errors via pending_error_text.
	(serve_valid_requests): Check for pending errors.

Sun Aug 20 00:59:46 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* options.h.in: Document usage of DIFF in update.c
	* update.c: Use DIFF -c, not DIFF -u.  The small improvement in
	diff size is not worth the hassle in terms of everyone having to
	make sure that DIFF is GNU diff (IMHO).

Sat Aug 19 22:05:46 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* recurse.c (start_recursion): Doc fix.

	* Makefile.in (LDFLAGS): Set to @LDFLAGS@.
	(options.h): Depend on ../config.status and options.h.in.
	Add rule to build it from dependents.

	explicit getwd then chdir.
	* import.c (import_descend_dir): Likewise.
	* modules.c (do_module): Likewise.

	* recurse.c (save_cwd, restore_cwd, free_cwd): Remove functions.
	New versions have been broken out into save-cwd.c.
	(do_dir_proc): Adapt to handle status code returned by new versions
	of save_cwd and restore_cwd -- and one fewer argument to restore_cwd.
	(unroll_files_proc): Likewise.

	* wrapper.c (wrap_name_has): Add default: abort () to switch
	statement to avoid warning from gcc -Wall.
	(wrap_matching_entry): Remove dcl of unused TEMP.
	(wrap_tocvs_process_file): Remove dcl of unused ERR.
	(wrap_fromcvs_process_file): Likewise.

	* cvs.h: Remove prototype for error.  Instead, include error.h.
	Also, remove trailing white space.

Thu Aug  3 10:12:20 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* import.c (import_descend_dir): Don't print probably-bogus CWD

Sun Jul 30 15:30:16 1995  Vince DeMarco  <vdemarco@bou.shl.com>

        * history.c: put ifdef SERVER_SUPPORT around tracing code incase
        the client/server code is not compiled into the program.

Sat Jul 29 16:59:49 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* subr.c (deep_remove_dir): Use struct dirent, not struct direct.

Sat Jul 29 18:32:06 1995  Vince DeMarco  <vdemarco@bou.shl.com>

	* add.c: Check wrap_name_has.

	* diff.c, checkin.c, import.c: have code call unlink_file_dir in
	the appropriate places instead of just calling unlink_file.

        * checkin.c: Remove one unlink call.

	* import.c (comtable): Add .m .psw .pswm.

	* import.c (add_rcs_file): Remove tocvsPath before returning.

	* subr.c (unlink_file_dir):  Add new function. unlinks the file if
	it is a file. or will do a recursive delete if the path is
	actually a directory.
	(deep_remove_dir): New function, helps unlink_file_dir.

	* mkmodules.c:  Added CVSROOTADM_WRAPPER (cvswrappers file) to the
	checkout file list.

Fri Jul 28 16:27:56 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* checkout.c (safe_location): Use PATH_MAX not MAXPATHLEN.

Fri Jul 28 19:37:03 1995  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* log.c (cvslog, log_fileproc): Pass all options (except -l)
	to rlog as-is, so that users can put spaces in options,
	can specify multiple -d options, etc.
	(ac, av): New variables.
	(log_option_with_arg, options): Remove.

	(log_fileproc): Don't prepend `/' to file name if update_dir is empty.

Tue Jul 25 00:52:26 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* checkout.c (safe_location): Don't use PROTO in function definition.

Mon Jul 24 18:32:06 1995  Vince DeMarco  <vdemarco@bou.shl.com>

	* checkout.c (safe_location):  fix a compiler warning. (Declare
	safe_location). Changed code in safe_location to call getwd
	instead of getcwd. getwd is declared in the ../lib directory and
	used exclusively thoughout the code. (this helps portability on
	non POSIX systems).

	* wrapper.c: updated Andrew Athan's email address.

	* main.c:  fix an ifdef so the code will compile. syntax error in
	the ifdef for CVS_NOADMIN.

Mon Jul 24 13:25:00 1995  Del <del@babel.dialix.oz.au>

	* checkout.c:  New procedure safe_location.
	Ensures that you don't check out into the repository
	itself.

	* tag.c, rtag.c, cvs.h, mkmodules.c:  Added a "taginfo" file in
	CVSROOT to perform pre-tag checks.

	* main.c, options.h.in:  Added a compile time option to
	disable the admin command.

Fri Jul 21 17:07:42 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* update.c, status.c, patch.c, checkout.c, import.c, release.c,
	rtag.c, tag.c: Now -q and -Q options just print an error message
	telling you to use global -q and -Q options.  The non-global
	options were a mess because some commands accepted them and some
	did not, and they were redundant with -q and -Q global options.

	* rcs.c, cvs.h, commit.c, log.c, find_names.c: Remove CVS.dea
	stuff.  It is slower than the alternatives and I don't think
	anyone ever actually used it.

Fri Jul 21 10:35:10 1995  Vince DeMarco <vdemarco@bou.shl.com>

	* Makefile.in (SOURCES, OBJECTS): Add wrapper.c, wrapper.o.
	* add.c, admin.c, checkout.c, commit.c, diff.c, import.c, log.c,
	remove.c, status.c: Call wrap_setup at start of commands.
	* add.c (add): Check for wrapper, as well as directory, in repository.
	* checkin.c: Add tocvsPath variable and associated handling.

	variable and associated handling.
	* no_diff.c: Add tocvsPath variable and associated handling.
	* recurse.c (start_recursion): Check wrap_name_has.
	* update.c: Copy, don't merge, copy-by-merge files.  Attempt to
	use -j on a copy-by-merge file generates a warning and no further
	action.

	* client.c: Revert David Lamkin patch, except for the bits about
	removing temp_filename and the .rej file.
	* sanity.sh (errmsg1): Test for the underlying bug which Lamkin
	kludged around.
	* client.c (call_in_directory): Set short_pathname to include the
	filename, not just the directory.  Improve comments regarding what
	is passed to FUNC.

Thu Jul 20 17:51:54 1995  David Lamkin  <drl@net-tel.co.uk>

	* client.c (short_pathname): Fixes the fetching of the whole file
	after a patch to bring it up to date has failed:
	   - failed_patches[] now holds short path to file that failed
	   - patch temp files are unlinked where the patch is done

Thu Jul 20 12:37:10 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.h: Declare error_set_cleanup
	* main.c: Call it.

	release.c, remove.c, repos.c, rtag.c, server.c, server.h,
	status.c, subr.c, tag.c, update.c, vers_ts.c, version.c: Put
	client code inside #ifdef CLIENT_SUPPORT, server code inside
	#ifdef SERVER_SUPPORT.  When reporting version, report whether
	client and/or server are compiled in.

Wed Jul 19 18:00:00 1995  Jim Blandy <jimb@cyclic.com>

	* subr.c (copy_file): Declare local var n to be an int,
	not a size_t.  size_t is unsigned, and the return values
	of read and write are definitely not unsigned.

	* cvs.h [HAVE_IO_H]: #include <io.h>.
	[HAVE_DIRECT_H]: #include <direct.h>.

Fri Jul 14 22:28:46 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* server.c (dirswitch, serve_static_directory, serve_sticky,

	* cvsbug.sh: Use /usr/sbin/sendmail, unless it doesn't
	exist, in which case use /usr/lib/sendmail.  (Thanks, DJM.)

	* server.c (server, server_cleanup): Use "/tmp" instead of
	"/usr/tmp" when the TMPDIR environment variable isn't set.  This
	is what the rest of the code uses.

Thu Jul 13 11:03:17 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* recurse.c (free_cwd): New function.
	(save_cwd, restore_cwd): Use it instead of simply freeing any
	string.  The function also closes any open file descriptor.

	* import.c (comtable): Now static.
	(comtable): Put braces around each element of initializer.

	* cvs.h: Add prototype for xgetwd.
	* recurse.c (save_cwd, restore_cwd): New functions to encapsulate
	run-time solution to secure-SunOS vs. fchown problem.
	(do_dir_proc, unroll_files_proc): Use new functions instead of
	open-coded fchdir/chdir calls with cpp directives.

        * sanity.sh: Change out of TESTDIR before removing it.
	Some versions of rm fail when asked to delete the current directory.

Tue Jul 11 16:49:41 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* hash.h (struct entnode, Entnode): moved from here...
	* cvs.h: to here.

Wed Jul 12 19:45:24 1995  Dominik Westner (dominik@gowest.ppp.informatik.uni-muenchen.de)

        * client.c (server_user): new var.
        (parse_cvsroot): set above if repo is "user@host:/dir".
        (start_rsh_server): if server_user set, then use it.

        * sanity.sh: remove the TESTDIR after done.

        * cvsbug.sh (GNATS_ADDR): now bug-cvs@prep.ai.mit.edu again.

Tue Jul 11 15:53:08 1995  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

        changes to configure.in are applied.

Tue Jul 11 14:32:14 1995 Michael Shields  <shields@tembel.org>

	* Makefile.in (LDFLAGS): Pick up from configure.

Tue Jul 11 14:20:00 1995  Loren James Rittle  <rittle@supra.comm.mot.com>

	* import.c (add_rev), commit.c (remove_file, ci_new_rev),
	checkin.c (Checkin), subr.c (make_message_rcslegal), cvs.h:
	Always perform sanity check and fix-up on messages to be passed
 	directly to RCS via the '-m' switch.  RCS 5.7 requires that a
 	non-total-whitespace, non-null message be provided or it will
 	abort with an error.  CVS is not setup to handle any returned
 	error from 'ci' gracefully and, thus, the repository entered a
 	trashed state.

	* sanity.sh: Add regression tests for new code and interactions
	with RCS 5.7.

Sun Jul  9 19:03:00 1995  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* .cvsignore: added new backup file

	* options.h.in: our new configure.in finds the right diff and
        grep paths now....

	* subr.c: quote the string in run_print() for visibility
	- indent a comment
	- Jun Hamano's xchmod() patch to prevent writable files
	(from previous local changes)

	* logmsg.c: fix a NULL pointer de-reference
	- clean up some string handling code...
	(from previous local changes)

	* parseinfo.c: add hack to expand $CVSROOT in an *info file.
	- document "ALL" and "DEFAULT" in opening comment for Parse_Info()
	- fix the code to match the comments w.r.t. callbacks for "ALL"
	- add a line of trace output...
	(from previous local changes)

	* mkmodules.c: add support for comments in CVSROOT/checkoutlist
	- add CVSroot used by something other .o, ala main.c
	(from previous local changes)

	* main.c, cvs.h: add support for $VISUAL as log msg editor
	(from previous local changes)

	* status.c: add support for -q and -Q (from previous local changes)


Sun Jul  9 18:44:32 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * log.c: trivial change to test ChangeLog stuff.

Sat Jul  8 20:33:57 1995  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* history.c: (history_write): Don't assume that fopen(..., "a")
	lets one interleave writes to the history file from different processes
	without interlocking.  Use open's O_APPEND option instead.
	Throw in an lseek to lessen the race bugs on non-Posix hosts.
	* cvs.h, subr.c (Fopen): Remove.

	* log.c (log_fileproc): Pass working file name to rlog, so that
	the name is reported correctly.

	regarding now-redundant code.
	* import.c (import): Call client_import_setup.

Tue Jul  4 09:21:26 1995  Bernd Leibing  <bernd.leibing@rz.uni-ulm.de>

	* rcs.c (RCS_parsercsfile_i): Rename error to l_error; SunOS4 /bin/cc
	doesn't like a label and function with the same name.

Sun Jul  2 12:51:33 1995  Fred Appelman <Fred.Appelman@cv.ruu.nl>

	* logmsg.c: Rename strlist to str_list to avoid conflict with
	Unixware 2.01.

Thu Jun 29 17:37:22 1995  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* rcs.c (RCS_check_kflag): Allow RCS 5.7's new -kb option.

	* Makefile.in (HEADERS): Remove options.h.in.
	(DISTFILES): Add options.h.in.
	Depend on options.h in addition to HEADERS.

Tue Jun 27 22:37:28 1995  Vince Demarco  <vdemarco@bou.shl.com>

	* subr.c: Don't try to do fancy waitstatus stuff for NeXT,
	lib/wait.h is sufficient.

Mon Jun 26 15:17:45 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Remove RCS-patches and convert.sh.

Fri Jun 23 13:38:28 1995  J.T. Conklin  (jtc@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* server.c (dirswitch, serve_co): Use CVSADM macro instead of
        literal "CVS".

Fri Jun 23 00:00:51 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README-rm-add: Do not talk about patching RCS, that only
	confuses people.
	* RCS-patches, convert.sh: Removed (likewise).

Thu Jun 22 10:41:41 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* subr.c: Change -1 to (size_t)-1 when comparing against a size_t.

Wed Jun 21 16:51:54 1995  nk@ipgate.col.sw-ley.de (Norbert Kiesel)

	* create_adm.c, entries.c, modules.c: Avoid coredumps if
	timestamps, tags, etc., are NULL.

	"Ok." when it's done.

Fri Jun 16 11:23:44 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* entries.c (fgetentent): Parenthesize assignment in if-conditional.

Thu Jun 15 17:33:28 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* server.c (get_buffer_data, buf_append_char, buf_append_data):
	  Don't conditionalize use of "inline".  Autoconf takes care of
	  defining it away on systems that don't grok it.

Thu Jun 15 13:43:38 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@cyclic.com)

	* options.h.in (DIFF): Default to "diff" not "diff -a" since diff
	might not support the -a option.

Wed Jun 14 11:29:42 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* import.c (import_descend): Initialize dirlist to NULL.

	* subr.c (copy_file): Fix infinite loop.

	* server.c (serve_directory): fix a memory leak.

	* checkout.c, commit.c, diff.c, history.c, import.c, log.c,
	  patch.c, release.c, remove.c, rtag.c, status.c, tag.c, update.c:
	  Use send_arg() to send command line arguments to server.

	* commit.c (fsortcmp), find_names (fsortcmp), hash.c (hashp,
	  findnode), hash.h (findnode), rcs.c (RCS_addnode,
	  RCS_check_kflag, RCS_check_tag, RCS_isdead, RCS_parse,
	  RCS_parsercsfile_i), rcs.h (RCS_addnode, RCS_check_kflag,
	  RCS_check_tag, RCS_parse): Added const qualifiers as
	  appropriate.
	* rcs.h (RCS_isdead): Added prototype.

	* hash.h (walklist, sortlist): correct function prototypes.

	* ignore.c (ign_setup): don't bother checking to see if file
	  exists before calling ign_add_file.

Fri Jun  9 11:24:06 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* all source files (rcsid): Added const qualifer.
	* ignore.c (ign_default): Added const qualifier.
	* subr.c (numdots): Added const qualifier to function argument.
	* cvs.h (numdots): Added const qualifier to prototype argument.

	* client.c (change_mode): Tied consecutive if statements testing
	  the same variable together with else if.

	* import.c (import_descend): Build list of subdirectories when
	  reading directory, and then process the subdirectories in that
	  list.  This change avoids I/O overhead of rereading directory
	  and reloading ignore list (.cvsignore) for each subdirectory.

Thu Jun  8 11:54:24 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* import.c (import_descend): Use 4.4BSD d_type field if it is
	  present.

	* lock.c (set_lockers_name): Use %lu in format and cast st_uid
	  field to unsigned long.

	* import.c (import): Use RCS_check_kflag() to check -k options.
	  (keyword_usage, str2expmode, strn2expmode, expand_names):
	  Removed.
	* rcs.c (RCS_check_kflag): Added keyword_usage array from import.c
	  for more descriptive error messages.

	* subr.c (run_setup, run_args): Changed variable argument
	  processing to work on machines that use <varargs.h>.

	* subr.c (copy_file, xcmp): Changed to read the file(s) by blocks
	  rather than by reading the whole file into a huge buffer.  The
	  claim that this was reasonable because source files tend to be
	  small does not hold up in real world situations.   CVS is used
	  to manage non-source files, and mallocs of 400K+ buffers (x2
	  for xcmp) can easily fail due to lack of available memory or
	  even memory pool fragmentation.
	  (block_read): New function, taken from GNU cmp and slightly
	  modified.

	* subr.c (xcmp): Added const qualifier to function arguments.
	* cvs.h (xcmp): Added const qualifer to prototype arguments.

	  (Fopen, open_file, isreadable, iswritable, isdir, isfile,
	  islink, make_directory, make_directories, rename_file,

	  prototype arguments.
	* subr.c (Fopen, Popen, open_file, isreadable, iswritable, isdir,
	  isfile, islink, make_directory, make_directories, rename_file,
	  link_file, unlink_file, copy_file): Added const qualifier to
	  function arguments.

	* logmsg.c (logfile_write), recurse.c (do_recursion, addfile):
	  Don't cast void functions to a void expression.  There is at
	  least one compiler (MPW) that balks at this.

	* rcs.c (keysize, valsize): Change type to size_t.

	* add.c (add_directory): Don't cast umask() argument to int.

	* import.c (add_rcs_file): Changed type of mode to mode_t.

	* rcscmds.c (RCS_merge): New function.
	* cvs.h (RCS_merge): Declare.
	* update.c (merge_file, join_file): Call RCS_merge instead of
	  invoking rcsmerge directly.

	* cvs.h: Include <stdlib.h> if HAVE_STDC_HEADERS, otherwise
	  declared getenv().
	* cvsrc.c, ignore.c, main.c: Removed getenv() declaration.

	* client.c (mode_to_string): Changed to take mode_t instead of
	  struct statb argument.  Simplified implementation, no longer
	  overallocates storage for returned mode string.
	* client.h (mode_to_string): Updated declaration.
	* server.c (server_updated): Updated for new calling conventions,
	  pass st_mode instead of pointer to struct statb.

	* cvs.h (CONST): Removed definition, use of const qualifier is
	  determined by autoconf.
	* history.c, modules.c, parseinfo.c: Use const instead of CONST.

	* add.c, admin.c, checkout.c, commit.c, diff.c, import.c, log.c,
	  main.c, mkmodules.c, patch.c, recurse.c, remove.c, rtag.c,
	  server.c, status.c, subr.c, tag.c, update.c: Changed function
	  arguments "char *argv[]" to "char **argv" to silence lint
	  warnings about performing arithmetic on arrays.

Tue Jun  6 18:57:21 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* version.c: Fix up version string, to say that this is Cyclic
        CVS.

Tue Jun  6 15:26:16 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* subr.c (run_setup, run_args, run_add_arg, xstrdup): Add const
	  qualifier to format argument.
	* cvs.h (run_setup, run_args, xstrdup): Likewise.

	* Makefile.in (SOURCES): Added rcscmds.c.
	  (OBJECTS): Added rcscmds.o.

	* rcscmds.c: New file, with new functions RCS_settag, RCS_deltag,
	  RCS_setbranch, RCS_lock, RCS_unlock.
	* checkin.c, commit.c, import.c, rtag.c, tag.c: Call above
	  functions instead of exec'ing rcs commands.
	* cvs.h: Declare new functions.

Mon May 29 21:40:54 1995  J.T. Conklin  (jtc@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* recurse.c (start_recursion, do_recursion): Set entries to NULL
	  after calling Entries_Close().

Sat May 27 08:08:18 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Makefile.in (check): Export RCSBIN only if there exists an
	`rcs' executable in ../../rcs/src.  Before, tests would fail when
	the directory existed but contained no executables.
	(distclean): Remove options.h, now that it's generated.
	(Makefile): Regenerate only *this* file when Makefile.in is
	out of date.  Depend on ../config.status.

Fri May 26 14:34:28 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* entries.c (Entries_Open): Added missing fclose().
	  (Entries_Close): Don't write Entries unless Entries.Log exists.

	* entries.c (Entries_Open): Renamed from ParseEntries; changed to
	  process Entries Log files left over from previous crashes or
	  aborted runs.
	  (Entries_Close): New function, write out Entries file if
	  neccessary and erase Log file.
	  (Register): Append changed records to Log file instead of
	  re-writing file.
	  (fgetentent): New function, parse one Entry record from a file.
	  (AddEntryNode): It's no longer an error for two records with the
	  same name to be added to the list.  New records replace older
	  ones.
	* cvs.h (Entries_Open, Entries_Close): Add prototypes.
	  (CVSADM_ENTLOG): New constant, name of Entries Log file.
	* add.c, checkout.c, client.c, find_names.c, recurse.c: Use
	  Entries_Open()/Entries_Close() instead of ParseEntries()/dellist().

	  history.c, import.c, log.c, patch.c, release.c, remove.c,
	  rtag.c, server.c, status.c, tag.c, update.c: Changed
	  conditionals so that return value of *printf is tested less than
	  0 instead of equal to EOF.

Thu May 25 08:30:12 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* subr.c (xmalloc): Never try to malloc zero bytes; if the user
	asks for zero bytes, malloc one instead.

Wed May 24 12:44:25 1995  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com>

	* subr.c (xmalloc): Don't complain about NULL if zero bytes were
	requested.

Tue May 16 21:49:05 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* subr.c (xmalloc): Never try to malloc zero bytes; if the user

	* lock.c (write_lock): Missed one instance where rmdir(tmp) should
	  have been changed to clear_lock().

Wed May  3 11:08:32 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* create_adm.c, entries.c, import.c, root.c: Changed conditionals
	  so that return value of *printf is tested less than 0 instead of
	  equal to EOF --- That's all Standard C requires.

Wed May  3 18:03:37 1995  Samuel Tardieu  <tardieu@emma.enst.fr>

	* rcs.h: removed #ifdef CVS_PRIVATE and #endif because cvs didn't
	  compile anymore.

Mon May  1 13:58:53 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* rcs.c, rcs.h: Implemented lazy parsing of rcs files.
	  RCS_parsercsfile_i modified to read only the first two records
	  of rcs files, a new function RCS_reparsercsfile is called only
	  when additional information (tags, revision numbers, dates,
	  etc.) is required.

Mon May  1 12:20:02 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* options.h.in: Distribute this instead.
	* ../INSTALL, ../README: Installation instructions updated.

	* client.c (start_rsh_server): Send the remote command to rsh as a
	single string.

Fri Apr 28 00:29:49 1995  Noel Cragg  <noel@vo.com>

	* commit.c: Added initializer for FORCE_CI

        * sanity.sh: Fix tests added 25 Apr -- they were expecting the
        server to make noise, but the CVS_SERVER variable had been
        accidentally set with the `-Q' flag.  Ran all tests -- both
        locally and remotely -- to verify that the change didn't break
        anything.

Thu Apr 27 12:41:52 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	is set, use its contents as the name of the program to invoke
	instead of `rsh'.

Thu Apr 27 12:18:38 1995  Noel Cragg  <noel@vo.com>

	* checkout.c (checkout): To fix new bug created by Apr 23 change,
        re-enabled "expand-module" functionality, because it has the side
        effect of setting the checkin/update programs for a directory.  To
        solve the local/remote checkout problem that prompted this change
        in the first place, I performed the next change.
	* server.c (expand_proc): Now returns expansions for aliases only.

Wed Apr 26 12:07:42 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* rcs.c (getrcskey): Rewritten to process runs of whitespace chars
	  and rcs @ strings instead of using state variables "white" and
	  "funky".

Fri Apr  7 15:49:25 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* lock.c (unlock): Only call stat if we need to.

Wed Apr 26 10:48:44 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* server.c (new_entries_line): Don't prototype.

Tue Apr 25 22:19:16 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* sanity.sh: Add new tests to catch bugs in Apr 23 change.

Tue Apr 25 17:10:55 1995  Roland McGrath  <roland@baalperazim.frob.com>

	* create_adm.c (Create_Admin): Use getwd instead of getcwd.

Sun Apr 23 20:58:32 1995  Noel Cragg  <noel@vo.com>

       	* checkout.c (checkout): Disabled "expand-module" functionality on
        remote checkout, since it makes modules behave like aliases (see
        longer note there).  This change necessitated the change below.
        Also merged the like parts of a conditional.

	* client.c (call_in_directory): Changed the algorithm that created
        nested and directories and the "CVS" administration directories
        therein.  The algoithm wrongly assumed that the name of the
        directory that that was to be created and the repository name were
        the same, which breaks modules.

	* create_adm.c (Create_Admin), module.c (do_module), server.c
        (server_register), subr.c, entries.c: Added fprintfs for trace-mode
	debugging.

	* client.c (client_send_expansions): Argument to function didn't
        have a type -- added one.

	* server.c (new_entries_line): Arguments to this function are
        never used -- reoved them and fixed callers.

Sat Apr 22 11:17:20 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* rcs.c (RCS_parse): If we can't open the file, give an error
	message (except for ENOENT in case callers rely on that).

Wed Apr 19 08:52:37 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* client.c (send_repository): Check for CVSADM_ENTSTAT in `dir', not
	in `.'.

	* sanity.sh: Add TODO list.  Revise some comments.  Add tests of
	one working directory adding a file and other updating it.

Sat Apr  8 14:52:55 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS): Let configure set the default for CFLAGS.
	Under GCC, we want -g -O.

Fri Apr  7 15:49:25 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* root.c (Name_Root): merge identical adjacent conditionals.

	* create_admin.c (Create_Admin): Rearranged check for CVSADM and
	  OCVSADM directories so that CVSADM pathname is only built once.

	* update.c (update_dirleave_proc): Removed code to remove CVS
	  administration directory if command_name == "export" and to
	  create CVS/Root file if it is not present.  Identical code
	  in update_filesdone_proc() will perform these same actions.
	  Also removed code that read and verfied CVS/Root.  This is
	  expensive, and if it is necessary should happen in the
	  general recursion processor rather than in the update
	  callbacks.

	* lock.c (masterlock): New variable, pathname of master lockdir.
	  (set_lock): removed lockdir argument, now constructs it itself
	  and stores it in masterlock.
	  (clear_lock): new function, removes master lockdir.
	  (Reader_Lock, write_lock): call clear_lock instead of removing
	  master lockdir.
	  (Reader_Lock, write_lock): #ifdef'd out CVSTFL code.

	* main.c (main): register Lock_Cleanup signal handler.
	* lock.c (Reader_Lock, write_lock): no longer register
	  Lock_Cleanup.

	* main.c (main): initialize new array hostname.
	* lock.c (Reader_Lock, write_lock): Use global hostname array.
	* logmsg.c (logfile_write): Likewise.

	* recurse.c (do_dir_proc, unroll_files_proc): Use open()/fchdir()
	  instead of getwd()/chdir() on systems that support the fchdir()
	  system call.

Fri Apr  7 06:57:20 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* server.c: Include the word "server" in error message for memory
	exhausted, so the user knows which machine ran out of memory.

	* sanity.sh: For remote, set CVS_SERVER to test the right server,
	rather than a random one from the PATH.

	* commit.c [DEATH_STATE]: Pass -f to `ci'.

Thu Apr  6 13:05:15 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* commit.c (checkaddfile): If we didn't manage to fopen the file,
	don't try to fclose it.

	* client.c (handle_m, handle_e): Use fwrite, rather than a loop of
	putc's.  Sometimes these streams are unbuffered.

Tue Apr  4 11:33:56 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* (DISTFILES): Include cvsbug.sh, ChangeLog, NOTES, RCS-patches,
	README-rm-add, ChangeLog.fsf, sanity.sh, sanity.el, and
	.cvsignore.

Mon Mar 27 08:58:42 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* rcs.c (RCS_parsercsfile_i): Accept `dead' state regardless of
	DEATH_STATE define.  Revise comments regarding DEATH_STATE versus
	CVSDEA versus the scheme which uses a patched RCS.
	* README-rm-add, RCS-patches: Explain what versions of CVS need
	RCS patches.

Sat Mar 25 18:51:39 1995  Roland McGrath  <roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* server.c (server_cleanup): Only do the abysmal kludge of waiting
 	for command and draining the pipe #ifdef sun.  The code makes
 	assumptions not valid on all systems, and is only there to
 	workaround a SunOS bug.

Wed Mar 22 21:55:56 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* server.c (mkdir_p): Call stat only if we get the EACCES.  Faster
	and more elegant.

Tue Jan 31 20:59:19 1995  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com>

	* server.c: Try to avoid starting the "rm -rf" at cleanup time
	until after subprocesses have finished.
	(command_fds_to_drain, max_command_fd): New variables.
	(do_cvs_command): Set them.
	(command_pid_is_dead): New variable.
	(wait_sig): New function.
	(server_cleanup): If command_pid is nonzero, wait for it to die,
	draining output from it in the meantime.  If nonzero SIG was
	passed, send a signal to the subprocess, to encourage it to die
	soon.

	* main.c (usage): Argument is now `const char *const *'.
	* cvs.h (usage): Changed prototype.
	(USE): Make new variable `const'.
	* add.c (add_usage), admin.c (admin_usage), checkout.c
	(checkout_usage, export_usage, checkout), commit.c (commit_usage),
	diff.c (diff_usage), history.c (history_usg), import.c
	(import_usage, keyword_usage), log.c (log_usage), main.c (usg),
	patch.c (patch_usage), release.c (release_usage), remove.c
	(remove_usage), rtag.c (rtag_usage), server.c (server), status.c
	(status_usage), tag.c (tag_usage), update.c (update_usage): Usage
	messages are now const arrays of pointers to const char.

	* import.c (comtable): Now const.
	* main.c (rcsid): Now static.
	(cmd): Now const.
	(main): Local variable CM now points to const.
	* server.c (outbuf_memory_error): Local var MSG now const.

	* client.c (client_commit_usage): Deleted.

Sat Dec 31 15:51:55 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* logmsg.c (do_editor): Allocate enough space for trailing '\0'.

Fri Mar  3 11:59:49 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* cvsbug.sh: Call it "Cyclic CVS" now, not "Remote CVS".  Call it
	version C1.4A, not 1.4A2-remote.  Send bugs to cyclic-cvs, not
	remote-cvs.

	* classify.c (Classify_File): Put check for dead file inside
	"#ifdef DEATH_SUPPORT".

Thu Feb 23 23:03:43 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* update.c (join_file): Don't pass the -E option to rcsmerge here,
	either (see Jan 22 change).

Mon Feb 13 13:28:46 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* cvsbug.sh: Send bug reports to remote-cvs@cyclic.com, rather
	than to the ordinary CVS bug address.  This does mean we'll have
	to wade through GNATS-style bug reports, sigh.

Wed Feb  8 06:42:27 1995  Roland McGrath  <roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* server.c: Don't include <sys/stat.h>; system.h already does, and
 	4.3BSD can't take it twice.

	* subr.c [! HAVE_VPRINTF] (run_setup, run_args): Don't use va_dcl
 	in declaration.  Declare the a1..a8 args which are used in the
 	sprintf call.
	* cvs.h [! HAVE_VPRINTF] (run_setup, run_args): Don't prototype
 	args, to avoid conflicting with the function definitions
 	themselves.

Tue Feb  7 20:10:00 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* client.c (update_entries): Pass the patch subprocess the switch
	"-b ~", not "-b~"; the latter form seems not to work with patch
	version 2.0 and earlier --- it takes the next argv element as the
	backup suffix, and thus doesn't notice that the patch file's name
	has been specified, thus doesn't find the patch, thus...  *aargh*

Fri Feb  3 20:28:21 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* log.c (log_option_with_arg): New function.
	(cvslog): Use it and send_arg to handle the rlog options that take
	arguments.  The code used to use send_option_string for
	everything, which assumes that "-d1995/01/02" is equivalent to
	"-d -1 -9 -9 -5 ...".

Tue Jan 31 15:02:01 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.life.uiuc.edu>

	* server.c: #include <sys/stat.h> for the new stat call in mkdir_p.
	(mkdir_p): Don't try to create the intermediate directory if it
	exists already.  Some systems return EEXIST, but others return
	EACCES, which we can't otherwise distinguish from a real access
	problem.

Sun Jan 22 15:25:45 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* update.c (merge_file): My rcsmerge doesn't accept a -E option,
	and it doesn't look too important, so don't pass it.

Fri Jan 20 14:24:58 1995  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* client.c (do_deferred_progs): Don't try to chdir to toplevel_wd
	if it has not been set.
	(process_prune_candidates): Likewise.

Mon Nov 28 09:59:14 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* client.c (client_commit): Move guts of function from here...
	* commit.c (commit): ...to here.

Mon Nov 28 15:14:36 1994  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com>

	* server.c (buf_input_data, buf_send_output): Start cpp directives
	in column 1, otherwise Sun 4 pcc complains.

Mon Nov 28 09:59:14 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* client.c (add_prune_candidate): Don't try to prune ".".

Tue Nov 22 05:27:10 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* server.c, client.c: More formatting cleanups.

	* client.h, client.c: New variable client_prune_dirs.

	functions.
	(send_repository, call_in_directory, get_responses_and_close):
	Call them.

Wed Nov 23 01:17:32 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* server.c (do_cvs_command): Don't select on STDOUT_FILENO unless
	we have something to write.

Tue Nov 22 05:27:10 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* remove.c (remove_fileproc): Only call server_checked_in if we
	actually are changing the entries file.

	* server.c (server_write_entries): New function.
	(dirswitch, do_cvs_command): Call it.
	(serve_entry, serve_updated): Just update in-memory data
	structures, don't mess with CVS/Entries file.

Mon Nov 21 10:15:11 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* server.c (server_checked_in): Set scratched_file to NULL after
	using it.

	* checkin.c (Checkin): If the file was changed by the checkin,
	call server_updated not server_checked_in.

Sun Nov 20 08:01:51 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* client.c (send_repository): Move check for update_dir NULL to
	before where we check last_update_dir.  Check for "" here too.

	* client.c (send_repository): Use new argument dir.

	* client.c: Pass new argument dir to send_repository and
	send_a_repository.

	* server.c, server.h (server_prog): New function.
	* modules.c (do_modules): Call it if server_expanding.
	* client.c: Support Set-checkin-prog and Set-update-prog responses.
	* server.c, client.c: Add Checkin-prog and Update-prog requests.

Fri Nov 18 14:04:38 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* client.c (get_short_pathname, is_cvsroot_level,
	call_in_directory): Base whether this is new-style or
	old-style based on whether we actually used the Directory request,
	not based on whether the pathname is absolute.  Rename
	directory_supported to use_directory.
	* server.c: Rename use_relative_pathnames to use_dir_and_repos.
	* client.c (send_a_repository): If update_dir is absolute, don't
	use it to try to reconstruct how far we have recursed.

	* server.c, server.h, client.c, client.h, vers_ts.c, update.h:
	More cosmetic changes (identation, PARAMS vs. PROTO, eliminate
	alloca, etc.) to remote CVS to make it more like the rest of CVS.

	* server.c: Make server_temp_dir just the dir name, not the name
	with "%s" at the end.
	* server.c, client.c: Add "Max-dotdot" request, and use it to make
	extra directories in server_temp_dir if needed.

Thu Nov 17 09:03:28 1994  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@cygnus.com>

	* client.c: Fix two cases where NULL was used and 0 was meant.

	not a subdirectory of toplevel_repos.

Mon Nov  7 09:12:01 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* patch.c: If file is removed and we don't have a tag or date,
	just print "current release".

	* main.c (main) [SERVER_SUPPORT]: Move call to getwd past where we
	know whether we are the server or not.  Set CurDir to "<remote>"
	if we are the server.

	* client.c: Remove #if 0'd function option_with_arg.
	Remove #if 0'd code pertaining to the old way of logging the
	session.

	* client.c (start_rsh_server): Don't invoke the server with the
	-d option.
	* server.c (serve_root): Test root for validity, just like main.c
	does for non-remote CVS.
	* main.c (main): If `cvs server' happens with a colon in the
	CVSroot, just handle it normally; don't make it an error.

Wed Nov  2 11:09:38 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* client.c (send_dirent_proc): If dir does not exist, just return

	* client.c: Reformat to bring closer to cvs standards for brace
	position, comment formatting, etc.

	* sanity.sh: Remove wrong "last mod" line.  Convert more tests to
	put PASS or FAIL in log file.  Change it so arguments to the
	script specify which tests to run.

	* client.c, client.h, server.c, checkout.c: Expand modules in
	separate step from the checkout itself.

Sat Oct 22 20:33:35 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@kr-pc.cygnus.com)

	toplevel_repos was NULL.

	* server.c (server_updated): If joining, don't remove file.

	out before joining.  After joining, call server_updated.  New

	* client.c (is_cvsroot_level): New function.
	(handle_set_sticky, handle_clear_sticky,

	* import.c (import_descend): If server, don't mention ignored CVS
	directories.
	* import.c (import_descend_dir): If client, don't print warm
	fuzzies, or make directories in repository.  If server, print warm
	fuzzies to stdout not stderr.
	* client.c (send_modified): New function, broken out from
	send_fileproc.
	(send_fileproc): Call it.

	* client.c (handle_clear_sticky, handle_set_sticky,

	the server and send the right requests.

Mon Oct  3 09:44:54 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* status.c (status_fileproc): Now that ts_rcs is just one time,
	don't try to print the second time from it.  (Same as raeburn 20
	Aug change, it accidentally got lost in 1.4 Alpha-1 merge).

	* cvs.h (CVSDEA): Added (but commented out for now).
	* rcs.c (RCS_parsercsfile_i) [CVSDEA]: Also look in CVSDEA to see if
	something is dead.
	* commit.c (ci_new_rev, mark_file) [CVSDEA]: New functions.
	(remove_file, checkaddfile) [CVSDEA]: Use them instead of ci -K.
	* find_names.c (find_dirs) [CVSDEA]: Don't match CVSDEA directories.
	* update.c (checkout_file): Check RCS_isdead rather than relying
	on co to not create the file.

	* sanity.sh: Direct output to logfile, not /dev/null.

	* subr.c (run_exec): Print error message if we are unable to exec.

	* commit.c (remove_file): Call Scratch_Entry when removing tag
	from file.  The DEATH_SUPPORT ifdef was erroneous.

Sun Oct  2 20:33:27 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* commit.c (checkaddfile): Instead of calling isdir before
	attempting to create the directory, just ignore EEXIST errors from
	mkdir.  (This removes some DEATH_SUPPORT ifdefs which actually had
	nothing to do with death support).

Thu Sep 29 09:23:57 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* diff.c (diff): Search attic too if we have a second tag/date.
	(diff_fileproc): If we have a second tag/date, don't do all the

	* checkin.c (Checkin): Check for error from unlink_file.

	* logmsg.c (do_editor): Reinstate message arg, but make it char
	**messagep instead of char *message.  Change occurances of message
	to *messagep.  Char return type from char * back to void.

	Rename it to user_file_rev because it need not be the head of any
	branch.
	(diff_file_nodiff): After checking user_file_rev, if we have both
	use_rev1 and use_rev2, compare them instead of going on to code
	which assumes use_rev2 == NULL.

	* cvsrc.c (read_cvsrc): Don't call getenv() three times when one
	  time will do.

	  int to size_t and remove the test that checks if it is less than
	  zero.

	* server.c (strerror): Static definition replaced by extern
	declaration.

Sun Aug 21 07:16:27 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@kr-pc.cygnus.com)

	* client.c (update_entries): Run "patch" with input from
	/dev/null, so if it's the wrong version, it fails quickly rather
	than waiting for EOF from terminal before failing.

Sat Aug 20 04:16:33 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* server.c (serve_unchanged): Instead of creating a file with a
	zero timestamp, rewrite the entries file to have "=" in the
	timestamp field.
	* vers_ts.c (mark_lost, mark_unchanged): New macros.
	(time_stamp_server): Use them, for clarity.  Interpret "="
	timestamp as an unchanged file.  A zero-timestamp file should
	never be encountered now in use_unchanged mode.

	* client.c (start_server): If CVS_CLIENT_PORT indicates a
	non-positive port number, skip straight to rsh connection.

	* status.c (status_fileproc): Fix ts_rcs reference when printing
	version info, to correspond to new Entries file format.  Don't
	print it at all if server_active, because it won't have any useful
	data.

Thu Aug 18 14:38:21 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* cvs.h (status): Declare.
	* client.c (client_status): New function.

	* status.c (status): Do the remote thing if client_active.

	* client.c (supported_request): New function.
	(start_server): Use it.

	growing stack frame by entire file size.
	(receive_file): New function, broken out from serve_modified.
	(serve_modified): Call it.
	(server): Print out name of unrecognized request.

	More generic stream-filtering support:
	* client.c (close_on_exec, filter_stream_through_program): New
	functions.
	(server_fd): New variable.
	(get_responses_and_close): Direct non-rsh connection is now
	indicated by server_fd being non-negative.  File descriptors for
	to_server and from_server may now be different in case "tee"
	filtering is being done.  Wait for rsh_pid specifically.
	(start_server): Use filter_stream_through_program for "tee"
	filter, and enable it for direct Kerberos-authenticated
	connections.  Use dup to create new file descriptors for server
	connection if logging is enabled.
	(start_rsh_server): Disable code that deals with logging.

	Per-file compression support:
	* cvs.h (gzip_level): Declare.
	* main.c (usg): Describe new -z argument.

	issue gzip-file-contents request.
	(send_fileproc): Optionally compress file contents.  Use a
	slightly larger buffer, anticipating the worst case.
	* server.c (gzip_level): Define here.
	(receive_file): Uncompress file contents if needed.
	(serve_modified): Recognize "z" in file size and pass receive_file
	appropriate flag.
	(buf_read_file_to_eof, buf_chain_length): New functions.
	(server_updated): Call them when sending a compressed file.
	(serve_gzip_contents): New function; set gzip_level.
	(requests): Added gzip-file-contents request.

Wed Aug 17 09:37:44 1994  J.T. Conklin  (jtc@cygnus.com)

	* find_names.c (find_dirs): Use 4.4BSD filesystem feature (it
	  contains the file type in the dirent structure) to avoid
	  stat'ing each file.

	* commit.c (remove_file,checkaddfile): Change type of umask
	  variables from int to mode_t.
	* subr.c (): Likewise.

Tue Aug 16 19:56:34 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* diff.c (diff_fileproc): Don't use diff_rev* because they're
	invariant across calls -- add new variable top_rev.
	(diff_file_nodiff): After checking possible use_rev* values, if
	top_rev is set drop it in as well (if we don't already have two
	versions) and then clear it for next time around.

Wed Aug 10 20:50:47 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* diff.c (diff_fileproc): if ts_user and ts_rcs match, then the
	file is at the top of the tree -- so we might not even have a
	copy. Put the revision into diff_rev1 or diff_rev2.

Wed Aug 10 14:55:38 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* server.c (do_cvs_command): Use waitpid.

	* subr.c (run_exec): Always use waitpid.

	* Makefile.in (CC, LIBS): Define here, in case "make" is run in
	this directory instead of top level.

Wed Aug 10 13:57:06 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* client.c (krb_get_err_text): use HAVE_KRB_GET_ERR_TEXT to
	determine if we need to use the array or the function.
	* main.c: ditto.

Tue Aug  9 16:43:30 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* entries.c (ParseEntries): If timestamp is in old format, rebuild
	it in the new format.  Fudge an unmatchable entry that won't
	trigger this code next time around, if the file is modified.

	* vers_ts.c (time_stamp): Only put st_mtime field into timestamp,
	and use GMT time for it.  With st_ctime or in local time, copying
	trees between machines in different time zones makes all the files
	look modified.
	(time_stamp_server): Likewise.

Tue Aug  9 19:40:51 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* main.c (main): use krb_get_err_text function instead of
	krb_err_txt array.

Thu Aug  4 15:37:50 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@sanguine.cygnus.com)

	* main.c (main): When invoked as kserver, set LOGNAME and USER
	environment variables to the remote user name.

Thu Aug  4 07:44:37 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* client.c: (handle_valid_requests): if we get an option that has
	rq_enableme set, then send that option. If it is UseUnchanged, set
	use_unchanged so that the rest of the client knows about
	it. (Could become a more general method for dealing with protocol
	upgrades.)
	(send_fileproc): if use_unchanged didn't get set, send an
	old-style "Lost" request, otherwise send an "Unchanged" request.
	* server.c (serve_unchanged): new function, same as serve_lost,
	but used in the opposite case.
	(requests): add new UseUnchanged and Unchanged requests, and make
	"Lost" optional (there isn't a good way to interlock these.)
	* server.h (request.status): rq_enableme, new value for detecting
	compatibility changes.
	* vers_ts.c (time_stamp_server): swap meaning of zero timestamp if
	use_unchanged is set.

Tue Jul 26 10:19:30 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* sanity.sh: Separate CVSROOT_FILENAME, which must be the filename
	of the root, from CVSROOT, which can include a hostname for
	testing remote CVS.  (but the tests aren't yet prepared to deal
	with the bugs in remote CVS).

	* import.c (update_rcs_file): Change temporary file name in TMPDIR
	from FILE_HOLDER to cvs-imp<process-id>.

	* sanity.sh: Add ">/dev/null" and "2>/dev/null" many places to
	suppress spurious output.  Comment out tests which don't work (cvs
	add on top-level directory, cvs diff when non-committed adds or
	removes have been made, cvs release, test 53 (already commented as
	broken), retagging without deleting old tag, test 63).  Now 'make
	check' runs without any failures.

Fri Jul 15 12:58:29 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@sanguine.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (install): Do not depend upon installdirs.

Thu Jul 14 15:49:42 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@sanguine.cygnus.com)

	* client.c, server.c: Don't try to handle alloca here; it's
	handled by cvs.h.

Tue Jul 12 13:32:40 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@sanguine.cygnus.com)

	* client.c (update_entries): Reset stored_checksum_valid if we

	(start_server): Clear toplevel_repos, last_dirname, last_repos.
	(client_update): If failed_patches is not NULL after doing first
	update, do another update, but remove all the failed files first.

Thu Jun 30 09:08:57 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* server.c (requests): Add request "Global_option".

	<krb.h>.
	(start_server): Save the name returned by gethostbyname.  Call

	* update.c (update_file_proc): Pass &docheckout to patch_file.  If
	it is set to 1, fall through to T_CHECKOUT case.
	(patch_file): Add docheckout argument.  Set it to 1 if we can't
	make a patch.  Check out the files and run diff rather than
	rcsdiff.  If either file does not end in a newline, we can't make
	a patch.  If the patch starts with the string "Binary", assume
	one or the other is a binary file, and that we can't make a patch.

Tue Jun 28 11:57:29 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@sanguine.cygnus.com)

	* client.c (update_entries): If the patch file is empty, don't run
