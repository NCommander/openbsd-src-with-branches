Thu Jan 16 00:06:00 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* version.c: Version 1.9.2.

Wed Jan 15 09:14:38 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* client.c (call_in_directory): Take code that creates CVSADM at
	top level, move it before the CVS_CHDIR (dir_name) call, and do it
	regardless of whether dir_name is ".".  Pass "." not dir_name to
	Create_Admin (when the code was written they were always the
	same).  Don't add reposdirname to the repository we pass to
	Create_Admin (when the code was written, I think reposdirname
	probably would always be ".").  Don't create CVSADM if
	reposdirname_absolute.
	* sanity.sh (basicb): Enable tests basicb-1a and basicb-9a for
	remote; tests for above fix.
	(basic1): Do entire test within a "1" directory to deal with
	creation of CVS directories at top level.  Support --keep.
	(conflicts): In test conflicts-136, only update first-dir.
	(basica): Uncomment the part that tests "cvs co -l .".  That tests
	the existing functionality which I might have (but hopefully did not)
	perturbed with the call_in_directory changes.

Mon Jan 13 11:04:32 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* server.c (check_command_legal_p): Do not call error (1, ...)
 	here; that will always cause a protocol violation by shutting down
	the connection prematurely.  Remove croak_on_illegal arg.
	(do_cvs_command): Move call to check_command_legal_p until after
	the call to print_pending_error.  Print the error message ourself.

	* mkmodules.c (filelist): Add readers and writers.  Add comment
	about why passwd is not included.  Add comment about meaning of
	NULL contents field.

Fri Jan 10 13:23:09 1997  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* release.c (release): Initialize delete_flag before reading it
	(found by running purify)

	* logmsg.c (do_verify): Fix reading unallocated memory (found by
 	running purify)

Thu Jan  9 16:32:47 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* checkout.c (build_dirs_and_chdir): Partially revert 3 Jan
	change--move call to Subdir_Register back above the CVS_CHDIR call
	(we need to register in the old, not the new, directory).  Instead
	of calling CVS_MKDIR and ignoring errors, call mkdir_if_needed;
	this is an effort to catch errors there rather than catching them
	in the CVS_CHDIR.  This makes test 27-add-add in sanity.sh work
	again.

	* find_names.c (Find_Directories): Remove code inside
	#ifdef ATTIC_DIR_SUPPORT and replace it with a comment explaining
	why we don't look in the attic.  ATTIC_DIR_SUPPORT was never defined.

	* find_names.c (find_dirs): Add comment about tmp being unset.

	* commit.c (checkaddfile): Report errors with errno and specific
	error messages.

	* rcs.c, commit.c, create_adm.c, entries.c, find_names.c,
	ignore.c, history.c: Nuke PATH_MAX arbitrary limits.

Wed Jan  8 23:07:41 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* add.c (add): Reindent a portion which needed it.

1997-01-08  Jim Kingdon

	* client.c (send_file_names): When looking name up in Entries,
	call Entries_Open and Entries_Close.  This has two effects:
	(1) we look at Entries.Log, and (2) we don't skip 'D' entries,
	both of which are needed to make us get the right (command
	line) name for a directory we are adding.

Wed Jan  8 14:50:47 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in, cvs.h, hash.h, myndbm.h, rcs.h: Remove CVSid; we
	decided to get rid of these some time ago.

Tue Jan  7 12:56:10 1997  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@ynu38.ynu.edu.cn>

        * root.c (check_root_consistent): new func, compares below new
        global var with CVSroot_directory, assuming both set.
        (set_local_cvsroot): use above new func for security check.
        (parse_cvsroot): same.
        But do all of above only #ifdef AUTH_SERVER_SUPPORT.

        * server.c: (Pserver_Repos): new global var, init to NULL.
        (pserver_authenticate_connection): set above new global.
        (check_repository_password): be a good scout and use
        CVSROOTADM and CVSROOTADM_PASSWD, now that they are the standard.
        Make sure all of above is in #ifdef AUTH_SERVER_SUPPORT.
        (check_command_legal_p): wrap most of body in #ifdef
        AUTH_SERVER_SUPPORT.
        Everywhere: wrap all references to CVS_Username in #ifdef
        AUTH_SERVER_SUPPORT.

        * cvs.h (Pserver_Repos): new var, used in consistency [security]
        check.  Defined only #ifdef AUTH_SERVER_SUPPORT.
        (CVSROOTADM_PASSWD): new #define, trying to get with the program.

Fri Jan  3 18:10:39 1997  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* checkout.c (build_dirs_and_chdir): Move call to Subdir_Register
	until after we know that the directory exists.

Thu Jan  2 13:30:56 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in, cvsbug.sh, edit.c, edit.h, error.c, error.h,
	fileattr.c, fileattr.h, filesubr.c, run.c, update.h, watch.c,
	watch.h: Remove "675" paragraph; see ../ChangeLog for rationale.

Thu Jan  2 12:27:46 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* sanity.sh (info): New test info-cleanup-verifymsg gets rid of
	verifymsg when we are done with it.

	* sanity.sh (basicb): Skip tests basicb-1a and basicb-9a for remote.
	* sanity.sh (modules-155a4): It is OK if a CVS directory exists.
	* sanity.sh (ignore): Do everything inside a "1" directory.  The
	change to create CVS directories at top-level causes messages such as
	"? home" otherwise.  In test 191, specify -I CVS so that new CVS
	directory is ignored.
	* sanity.sh (crerepos): Manually remove CVS directory which had not
	existed before.

Thu Jan  2 09:06:20 1997  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@ynu38.ynu.edu.cn>

        * server.c: Changes for pserver read-only repository access:
        (check_command_legal_p): new func.  Right now, just checks if
        repository modification is permitted, and that only if pserver is
        active.
        (do_cvs_command): take new parameter `cmd_name', a string.  All
        callers changed.  Pass it on to new func check_command_legal_p()
        before executing the command.
        (CVS_Username): new global, init to NULL.  Used by
        check_command_legal_p(), set in check_password().
        (check_password): set above new global CVS_Username; reorganized a
        bit to facilitate this.
        (check_repository_password): give *host_user_ptr permanent
        storage iff success.

        * main.c: Changes for pserver read-only repository access:
        (lookup_command_attribute): new func.
        (main): use new func lookup_command_attribute() to establish if
        CVS_CMD_IGNORE_ADMROOT and CVS_CMD_USES_WORK_DIR.

        * cvs.h: Changes for pserver read-only repository access:
        (CVSROOTADM_READERS, CVSROOTADM_WRITERS): new #defines.
        Prototype lookup_command_attribute().
        (CVS_CMD_IGNORE_ADMROOT, CVS_CMD_USES_WORK_DIR,
        CVS_CMD_MODIFIES_REPOSITORY): new #defines for
        lookup_command_attribute() and its callers.

Wed Jan  1 19:50:38 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* options.h.in: Reword comment for TMPDIR_DFLT to make it clear
	that this isn't specific to the pserver server.

	* modules.c (do_module): Give an error message if one tries to
	specify -a together with another option.
	* sanity.sh (modules2): New tests modules2-a* test for above fix.

	* sanity.sh (devcom): Add tests devcom-a-nonexist and
	devcom-t-nonexist for "cvs watchers" on nonexistent argument.

1997-01-01  Fred Fish  <fnf@ninemoons.com>

	* run.c (piped_child, filter_stream_through_program): Actually
	install these HAVE_VFORK patches that got missed.
	(There was a log entry for these changes for 29 Nov 1996 but it
	seems I accidentally forgot to actually check them in -kingdon).

Wed Jan  1 18:32:44 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in: Add ChangeLog-96.
	* ChangeLog-96: New file, contains former contents of ChangeLog.
	* ChangeLog: Now just contains 1997 changes.


For older changes see ChangeLog-96.
