WHAT THE "DEATH SUPPORT" FEATURES DO:

(Some of the death support stuff is documented in the main manual, but
this file is for stuff which noone has gotten around to adding to the
main manual yet).

CVS with death support can record when a file is active, or alive, and
when it is removed, or dead.  With this facility you can record the
history of a file, including the fact that at some point in its life
the file was removed and then later added.

Files can now be added or removed in a branch and later merged
into the trunk.

	cvs update -A
	touch a b c
	cvs add a b c ; cvs ci -m "added" a b c
	cvs tag -b branchtag
	cvs update -r branchtag
	touch d ; cvs add d
	rm a ; cvs rm a
	cvs ci -m "added d, removed a"
	cvs update -A
	cvs update -jbranchtag

Added and removed files may also be merged between branches.

Files removed in the trunk may be merged into branches.

Files added on the trunk are a special case.  They cannot be merged
into a branch.  Instead, simply branch the file by hand.
