Wed Jun 18 00:00:02 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Mention pserver --allow-root.

Mon Jun 16 19:07:34 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (SUBDIRS): Add emx.
	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Add emx.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Sun Jun  8 23:44:00 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Remove mkfifo; not used anywhere.
	* configure, config.h.in: Regenerated.

Thu May 29 15:53:06 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* DEVEL-CVS: Add "Policy regarding checkout-only access" to
	replace parenthetical remark about checkout-only access.  This is
	more of a cosmetic/editorial change than a new policy.

Wed May 21 17:02:29 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Add item about wrappers.

Fri May 16 13:43:53 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Add item about "cvs export" and binary files.

Sun May 11 11:38:03 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README.VMS: Remove information about "direct TCP".  Noone has
	been complaining about it being broken (the code bitrotted not long
	after it was written), nor has anyone complained
	that contrib/listener.c was omitted from the distribution (because
	it wasn't mentioned in contrib/Makefile.in DISTFILES).  If there
	is a desire to resurrect such a feature, it should use port 2401
	as now discussed in doc/cvsclient.texi.

Thu May  8 12:14:40 1997  Larry Jones  <larry.jones@sdrc.com>
	and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Update MIPS/SGI Irix 6.2
	* TESTS: Add note about TESTDIR and SGI Irix 6's XFS.

Wed May  7 12:01:21 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: Fix keywords accidentally expanded in previous checkin.

	* TODO: Add item #185, concerning keyword expansion and merges.

Sun May  4 19:46:03 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Replace section on reporting bugs with a reference to
	the bug-reporting section in cvs.texinfo.

Fri May  2 22:50:04 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Remove item about importing binary files; the bug is fixed.

Sun Apr 27 19:54:34 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Refer to doc/DIFFUTILS-2.7-BUG.

	* INSTALL: Don't mention GREP; CVS no longer uses it.

	* configure.in: Add comment about --bindir.

Thu Apr 24 15:21:17 1997  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@cosa.de>

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): added tempnam and mktemp
	* config.h.in, configure: Regenerated with autoconf 2.10.

21 Apr 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* cvsnt.mak: Visual C++, as usual, wants to fiddle with this.
	This time it would appear to be chiefly the dependencies.

Mon Apr 21 01:06:31 1997  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* NEWS: Document that the client no longer needs an external patch
	program.

Thu Apr 17 14:28:20 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: Combine items 150 and 181 since they are basically the same.

Tue Apr 15 12:32:26 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* FAQ: The URL of yahoo's Configuration Management category has
	changed.  As it might change again, just cite their top-level page
	rather than the entire URL.

8 Apr 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* cvsnt.mak: Add windows-NT/sockerror.c.

Wed Mar 26 15:51:33 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Further note on import -kb bug.

Tue Mar 25 17:51:32 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs-format.el: Add comment concerning c-label-offset.

Wed Mar 19 14:06:40 1997  Jim Meyering  <meyering@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (test for shadow passwords): Use AC_MSG_RESULT
 	rather than echo, so configure obeys --quiet.
	Use yes and no in message rather than yup and nope.

19 Mar 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* cvsnt.mak: Now Visual C++ wants to add a bunch of dependencies
	for the Release configuration as well as the Debug one.  Why it
	didn't do this before, I have no idea.

13 Mar 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* cvsnt.mak: Recent changes have added a number of getline.h
	dependencies.

Thu Mar 13 08:43:04 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (AC_C_CROSS): Add comment about obsolescence
	thereof.
	* config.h.in, configure: Regenerated with autoconf 2.10.

Thu Mar 13 05:50:29 1997  Philippe De Muyter  <phdm@info.ucl.ac.be>

	Here are the fixes I needed to make to cvs-1.9 to get it to
	compile and successfully pass 'make check' on m68k-motorola-sysv.
	* lib/getwd.c (getwd): Added declaration for getcwd().
	* lib/wait.h (WIFSTOPPED et al.): Macro defined if not defined.
	* lib/waitpid.c (waitpid): Use wait, not wait3, if !HAVE_WAIT3.
	* src/admin.c (admin): Added declaration for getgrnam().
	* src/server.c (fcntl.h): Do not include file twice.  Already included
	from system.h from cvs.h.
	* src/sanity.sh (imported-f*): Renamed from imported-file*, that were
	too long for sysv.
	* configure.in (wait3): Added to AC_CHECK_FUNCS list.

Wed Mar 12 14:32:50 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Add "failed assertion `rev == NULL || isdigit (*rev)'" bug.

	* TODO: Remove item 135; this is solved by %v and %V in loginfo.

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Don't check for setvbuf;
	HAVE_SETVBUF is no longer used.
	* config.h, configure: Regenerated with autoconf 2.10.

	* TODO: Add item 184, concerning MD5-based password hash.
	Remove item 14, concerning "pathname stripper".  I think that was
	a reference to the late unlamented strip_path.

Sat Mar  8 21:22:54 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: NT 4.0 is client and local (like other NT 3.51 & Win95).

Fri Mar  7 16:51:13 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Just talked to a NT 4.0 user; add it to the list.

Sun Mar  2 22:01:23 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Add item about "cvs admin" vs. "cvs admin .".

	* TODO: Remove item #169.  It doesn't really explain what an
	"archive library" is or in general what the feature they discuss is
	supposed to do--I mean, CVS _can_ be used to store .o's, if
	that is what they are talking about.

	* TODO: Add item #183, about greater documentation/visiblity for
	Entries.Static and CVS/Tag.

	* INSTALL (footnote 5): Add note about how /usr/tmp vs. /var/tmp
	shouldn't be an issue anymore

Thu Feb 20 13:53:19 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Update Cray entry per mail from John Bowman
	<bowman@ipp-garching.mpg.de>

	* configure.in: Add comments about autoconf version.

Mon Feb 17 09:55:35 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure: Regenerated.

Sat Feb 15 15:37:39 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Add windows-NT/SCC/Makefile.

Sun Dec 15 13:12:30 1996  Michael Douglass <mikedoug@texas.net>
			  and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Mention "cvs logout".

1997-02-12  Jim Kingdon

	* cvsnt.mak: Visual C++ seems to want to make some cosmetic
	changes (reordering *.obj files), perhaps prodded by "Save
	All".  I hope that putting in these changes will make it
	happy...

1997-02-11  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@cyclic.com>

	* cvsnt.mak: Replace with version from Visual C++ 4.0.  If someone
	wants the 2.x one back, I suppose we can put them side by side,
	but I won't be able to update the 2.x one any more as I won't be
	having access to 2.x.

Tue Feb 11 16:43:43 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* .cvsignore: Add cvsnt.mdp and cvsnt.ncb.  They seem to be files
	created by Visual C++ 4.x which were not created by Visual C++ 2.x.

Tue Feb  4 11:42:30 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: OS/2 port is client only.

	* Rename devel-cvs (which had only been in the repository, not the
	distribution) to DEVEL-CVS.  Add "Charter for the devel-cvs
	mailing list:" heading, "CVS Development Policies" title, and
	one-sentence introduction (editorial changes, not run by
	devel-cvs).  Revise paragraph concerning membership in the list to
	reflect policy change to make read-only membership different from
	the ability to send to the list (the new wording was approved by
	devel-cvs, as was the rename and including it in the
	distribution).
	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add DEVEL-CVS.
	* HACKING: Add "Mailing lists" section.

Tue Jan 28 10:41:05 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Remove AC_CHECK_SIZEOF; no longer needed with
	lib/md5.c changes.
	* acconfig.h: Add HAVE_CONNECT.  This is needed so that autoheader
	2.10 works; I think this has been broken since 2 Dec 1996.
	* config.h.in: Regenerated with autoheader 2.10.
	* configure: Regenerated with autoconf 2.10.

	* HACKING: Revise criterion for whether something goes in NEWS
	again (now "user-visible change worth mentioning"--the language
	from the GNU coding standards).

Mon Jan 27 23:05:24 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* HACKING: Criterion for whether something goes in NEWS is not
	whether it is user-visible; it is whether it is a bugfix or a
	feature.

Tue Jan 21 10:21:53 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Warn people against pre-5.x RCS; describe how to find
	out what version of RCS you have.

Wed Jan  8 14:50:47 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in, NEWS, README, TODO, configure.in: Remove CVSid; we
	decided to get rid of these some time ago.

Wed Jan  8 00:17:13 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README (Credits): Refer to NEWS not ChangeLog; the ChangeLog in
	question got renamed a bit but ended up as the bottom of the NEWS
	file.  Eliminate use of first person in a few places where it is
	unclear who it refers to.  Explicitly say that the lists
	of contributors are not comprehensive.

Thu Jan  2 12:59:45 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README, Makefile.in: Remove paragraph about writing to the Free
	Software Foundation at 675 Massachusetts Avenue.  (1) They are no
	longer at that address; (2) the Free Software Foundation are not
	the ones to write to concerning CVS licensing.  bug-cvs would be a
	more appropriate choice; (3) there is probably little need for
	this paragraph anyway.

Thu Jan  2 09:46:37 1997  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@ynu38.ynu.edu.cn>

        * NEWS: mention read-only repository access feature.

Wed Jan  1 18:47:08 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.spec: Don't include ChangeLog and ChangeLog.zoo in %doc.
	There is no point in including them without src/ChangeLog,
	src/ChangeLog-96, etc., but more to the point they really belong
	in the source distribution rather than a binary distribution anyway.

Mon Dec 30 16:55:54 1996  Abe Feldman  <feldman@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Add entry for changes to checkout command (creating CVS
	directory at top of working directory)

Tue Dec 17 13:13:30 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Add entry for verifymsg.

Tue Dec 10 19:22:20 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs-format.el: Revise comments to explain how to use it and
	general minor tidying of comments.

Mon Dec  2 13:05:44 1996  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Don't call AC_CHECK_FUNCS(connect) a second time,
	because the value will have been cached; instead, check whether
	the library was found with connect defined.
	* configure: Rebuild with autoconf 2.12.

Sat Nov 30 23:04:52 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Add note about mysterious failure in test 187a3.

Fri Nov 29 10:19:50 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Also check for readlink.
	* config.h.in: Regenerated using autoheader 2.10.

Fri Nov 22 16:30:27 1996  Brendan Kehoe  <brendan@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Check for -lsocket, etc., before checking for
	Kerberos libraries.
	* configure: Rebuild.

1996-11-19  Jim Kingdon

	* cvsnt.mak: Remove strippath.c.

Sun Nov  3 21:54:18 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Move detailed information on compatibility to
	the manual; simply point to it here.

Thu Oct 31 07:20:45 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Add note about cvs import of binary files on non-unix.

Tue Oct 29 13:59:14 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Add note about "dying gasps" message.

Sat Oct 26 16:17:09 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Check for tzset.

Fri Oct 25 10:27:08 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Mention new loginfo features.

Thu Oct 24 08:21:48 1996  Lars.Henriksen@netman.dk

	* INSTALL: Update to "DEC Alpha running OSF/1 version 3.2 (1.9)"

Tue Oct 22 10:34:21 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle.rain.org>

	* configure.in: don't check for the existence of the /etc/security
 	directory, because it's possible to have PAM installed without
 	using shadow passwords.
	* configure: regenerated.

Sat Oct 19 18:34:29 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Say that the remote protocol is not interoperable before
	CVS 1.5.

Sat Oct 19 13:06:53 1996  Mark H. Wilkinson  <mhw@minster.york.ac.uk>
			  and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@cyclic.com>

	* configure.in, INSTALL: New options for configure to enable or
	disable client and server code, overriding configure's defaults.
	* confiugre: Regenerated.

Sat Oct 19 13:06:53 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Add note about what to do if you got a binary
	distribution of CVS.  Add VAX/VMS entry.

Thu Oct 17 15:38:03 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS, README: Reinstate 30 Sep 96 changes concerning US letter
	vs. A4 paper.

Wed Oct 16 16:59:57 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Simplify code to check for crypt.  Check for
	-lcrypt first, and then check for the crypt function.  The old
	code did slightly funky things with cache variables, which JimK's
	last change disturbed.  Let's just keep it simple.
	* configure: Rebuilt.

Wed Oct 16 15:01:59 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Don't call unset.  It isn't portable to Ultrix,
	but perhaps more to the point, seems like we should be using the
	cached values (there was no comment explaining why we should
	ignore the cached values, and none of the CVS developers were
	able to	provide an explanation when I asked).
	* configure: Regenerated.

	* NEWS: Add item regarding export and "cvs history".

Tue Oct 15 07:40:42 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TESTS: Mention the fact that expr is only for the tests, not for
	CVS itself.  At least one person was unclear on this.

Mon Oct 14 12:13:03 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* HACKING: Add "Submitting patches (strategy)" section and
	sentence about test cases.  These changes have been run by
	devel-cvs and there was no objection.

Sat Oct 12 19:43:56 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README.VMS: Add notes about some build problems on VAX/VMS.

Thu Oct 10 09:20:25 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Remove item about & in modules file and client/server; the
	bug is fixed.

	* README.VMS: Rewrite sections about wildcard expansion and
	calling editors to suggest technical approaches and to make it
	clear that fixes will only happen if someone gets around to them.

Sat Oct  5 15:01:22 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Version 1.9 released.

Tue Oct  1 14:32:44 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS, README: Revert changes regarding -D, -g, and A4.  They
	are for new features which are not appropriate at this stage of
	the release process.

Mon Sep 30 14:51:36 1996  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* INSTALL (sun3): 1.8.86+ builds and runs make check.

	* NEWS: describe -D and -g; DIFFBIN and GREPBIN

	* MINOR-BUGS: yet another couple of annoyances...

Mon Sep 30 08:33:51 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Mention "cvs add -m" client/server bug.

	* NEWS: Document change from A4 to US letter.  It may seem minor,
	but it affects a *lot* of people.

	* README: Revise discussion of US letter vs. A4 to reflect recent
	change to cvs.texinfo.

Sun Sep 29 16:32:47 1996  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* MINOR-BUGS: describe a minor annoyance or two

	* BUGS: describe a couple of new bugs

Sun Sep 29 14:09:49 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle.rain.org>

	* configure.in: check for shadow password files as well as for
 	getspnam.  Some systems (like Linux) have getspnam in the C
 	library, but aren't necessarily using shadow passwords.
	* configure, config.h.in: Regenerate.

Fri Sep 27 16:49:53 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (TSUBDIRS): Remove comment about order of
	directories mattering.  That was only for an old set of hacks,
	since gone, which tried to combine several tag files into one
	(before emacs could use several tag files at once).

Wed Sep 25 10:35:06 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Add note about "cvs log -d" date formats changing.  See
	comment I added to cvs.texinfo for more whining about this situation.

	* BUGS: Remove item about ~/.cvsignore on NT; it is fixed.

Wed Sep 25 10:22:00 1996  Larry Jones  <larry.jones@sdrc.com>

	* configure.in: Add hack for ISC crypt (the version in the posix C
	library doesn't work -- why am I not surprised).  Add check for
	libsec.a for shadow password functions.

	* Makefile.in: Make zlib along with lib in the check targets.

Wed Sep 25 08:34:01 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@floss.cyclic.com>

	Fix from Mark A. Solinski <markso@mcs.com>:
	* cvsnt.mak: The debug configuration adds the zlib directory to
	the include path but it is missing from the release configuration.
	Add it to the "ADD CPP" and "CPP_PROJ" lines.

Tue Sep 24 11:32:20 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Add VMS entry.  Clarify what "tested" means.

	* README: Replace section about what CVS is with the blurb from
	cvs.spec (which is also the paragraph we use in the release
	announcements).
	Change location of pcl-cvs from contrib/pcl-cvs to tools/pcl-cvs.

	* BUGS: Remove item about version numbers; we now have version
	numbers.  Remove item about server using /usr/tmp; this has been
	changed.  Remove item about deadlocks between server and client
	and file contents being interpreted as commands; I believe this
	refers to the case which was fixed by Ian's 7 Aug 96 change to
	receive_partial_file.  Remove item about server temp directory
	becoming full; I'm not sure all bugs related to that have been
	fixed, but I think the ones mentioned have been.  Remove item
	about .# files; this is a documented behavior.  Refer to
	platform-specific documentation.  Add bug with & in modules file
	and client/server CVS.  Move bug about weird use of long file
	names to end; the bug report is so long people won't want to read
	past it.  Refer to README concerning reporting bugs.  Add
	introduction.  Reword some bug descriptions.  Add bug concerning
	~/.cvsignore on NT.
	* MINOR-BUGS: Add introduction.  Reword some bug descriptions.
	Remove item about "premature end of file"--we've improved that
	error message as much as we can figure out how.  Remove item about
	filenames getting truncated (with rcs2log?)--I think this is a fixed
	bug although I couldn't quickly find a ChangeLog entry for the fix.

Tue Sep 17 12:46:37 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* .cvsignore: Add cvs-*.spec.

Mon Sep 16 17:42:30 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: In 180, mention issue of network being down.  Add item
	182, about inclusiveness of "cvs log -r foo -r bar".

	* HACKING: Also mention arbitrary limits and reentrancy.
	User-visible changes should be documented in cvs.texinfo as well
	as NEWS.

Thu Sep 12 16:06:33 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README.VMS: Put authorship info at end.  Add disclaimer.  Say
	that patch is mandatory not optional.  Don't mention gzip; we
	don't require it any more.  Remove section on filename case; the
	bugs described there are fixed.  Miscellaneous tweaks and updates.

Wed Sep 11 11:08:39 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Don't forget to create vms/Makefile.

Tue Sep 10 19:55:07 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add build.com and README.VMS.
	(SUBDIRS): Add vms.
	* build.com: Also recurse into zlib directory.

	* NEWS: Mention Win95.

Fri Sep  6 11:43:26 1996  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Add AC_ARG_ENABLE for encryption.
	* acconfig.h: Add ENCRYPTION.
	* configure, config.h.in: Regenerate.
	* NEWS: Modify the entry on encryption to mention that you must
	configure with --enable-encryption.
	* INSTALL: Mention the --with-krb4 and --enable-encryption
	configure options.

Thu Sep  5 11:30:45 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Revise access method item to mention both :ext: and
	:server:.

	* README.VMS: Change bug reporting address to bug-cvs.  In
	discussing filenames, don't mention a hypothetical behavior
	involving folding to lowercase (I'm not sure what is meant, and it
	doesn't sound right to me) and do mention that things might be
	different now (as a result of recent changes to case sensitivity
	code).

Wed Sep  4 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@cyclic.com>

	* cvsnt.mak: Add windows-NT/ChangeLog.

Wed Sep  4 13:55:11 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	anywhere.
	* config.h.in, configure: Regenerated.

	remove __CHAR_UNSIGNED__.

Fri Aug 16 13:37:19 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvs.spec (%description): Replace description with one that
	resembles the release announcements we have been sending out.  The
	previous one was out of date and not really focused on describing
	what CVS does.
	(%build): Don't define SERVER_FLOWCONTROL; if we are ready to make
	this is the default it should be for all kinds of builds, not just
	those via RPM.

Fri Aug 16 16:09:59 1996  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* cvs.spec: new file.  This is a template for a RPM specification
	file (which is used by 'make spec').

	* Makefile.in (installdirs-local): new (empty) target
	(all install uninstall installdirs): add installdirs to list of
	targets which are done for all subdirs 
	(spec): new target to create a rpm specification file (which can
	be used to create RPM source and binary packages)
	(dist): depend on spec (which now also creates .fname)

Wed Aug 14 13:59:11 1996  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	the integrated development environment).

Sun Jul 14 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@cyclic.com>

	files in zlib.  Add /I "zlib" compiler options.

	* NEWS: Expand zlib item to emphasize user-visible (and
	CVS-installer-visible) consequences.

Sun Jul  7 23:21:02 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	a very old version of the CVS server for nefarious purposes and it

	* NEWS: Describe "cvs diff -q" removal and new diff options.

Thu Jun 13 17:29:30 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: Remove item #67 about having cvs import create CVS
	directories; I don't think it is wise to have cvs import mess with
	the directory it is working in at all.  Remove item #69 about
	having import edit modules--in many cases there is no need for an
	entry in modules.  Remove item #76 about running on top of SCCS;
	we are clearly not evolving in that direction.  Remove item #91
	about documenting how to import sources from SCCS or RCS; this is
	now documented in cvs.texinfo.  Remove item #129 about "U CFTS/";
	without more information it is impossible to know what behavior is
	being discussed.  Remove item #157 concerning module names in cvs
	release; cvs release takes a directory name, not a module name.
	Remove item #159 about checking access times; this is as likely to
	be an annoyance as a help, and people who are into that can just
	look at the result from "cvs update" (directly or with a script).
	Remove item #164 concerning variables in *info files; it is done.
	Remove item #35 (it just says "cvs admin" is cheesy, which isn't
	specific enough to be useful).  Rewrite #39 to be specific about
	what would be nice in having branches track each other.  Remove
	item #46--I'm not sure what it means and if it means that one
	should check in with "cci" or some such instead of "cvs ci" then
	that is an installation hassle and a minimal convenience.  Add
	item #180.

	* config.h.in: Regenerated.

Thu Jun 13 1996  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>
		 and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Put -L${krb_libdir} in LDFLAGS temporarily when
	looking for -ldes.

	* NEWS: Mention new annotate options.

Thu Jun  6 14:08:31 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* lib/savecwd.c: Revert CVS_* patch.  The include files where
	CVS_* is defined were not included, and the code in question was
	inside HAVE_FCHDIR which isn't defined on the Mac anyway.

	* src/filesubr.c: Revert CVS_* patch in this one file.  The mac
	port should have its own copy of filesubr.c instead.

Wed Jun 05 10:03:10 1996  Mike Ladwig  <mike@twinpeaks.prc.com>

	* lib/{system.h,savecwd.c}, src/{add.c,checkout.c,client.c,
	commit.c,create_adm.c,diff.c,edit.c,entries.c,fileattr.c,
	filesubr.c,find_names.c,history.c,ignore.c,import.c,lock.c,

	parseinfo.c,patch.c,rcs.c,recurse.c,release.c,remove.c,root.c,
	rtag.c,server.c,tag.c,update.c,vers_ts.c,wrapper.c}:
	Under non-UNIX operating systems (MS-DOS, WinNT, MacOS), many
	filesystem calls take only one argument; permission is handled
	very differently on those systems than in UNIX.  On MacOS,
	the naming scheme for volumes and subdirectories is quite
	different.  This patch leaves hooks in the form of CVS_ACCESS,
	CVS_CHDIR, CVS_CREAT, CVS_FOPEN, CVS_MKDIR, CVS_OPEN, CVS_OPENDIR,
	CVS_RENAME, CVS_RMDIR, CVS_STAT, and CVS_UNLINK to accomodate
	these differences.

Thu Jun  6 11:11:53 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Say "changes from 1.7 to 1.8" not "changes since 1.7".

Wed Jun  5 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@cyclic.com>

	* cvsnt.mak: Visual C++ 2.1 seems to want to reformat the line
	breaks.  No substantive changes, I think.

Thu May 30 15:35:57 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): add TESTS.

Tue May 28 13:10:42 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* src/server.c: Add comment regarding out-of-order bug.
	* TESTS: Explain out-of-order bug.

	* INSTALL: Remove $CVSId$.  More strongly encourage people to skip
	the tests if they don't have the time to look at the results.
	Move most of the discussion of tests to new file TESTS, and add
	some information on interpreting check.log output.
	* README: In brief summary of install, don't spell out details of
	"make check" or "cvs init" steps.

Sun May 26 17:59:46 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Change "up-to-date" to "not locally modified"; the file
	need not match the head revision it only need match some revision.

Sun May 26 17:02:49 1996  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* NEWS: document new option "-c" for tag

Thu May 23 21:49:33 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	for listing here is fairly easy portability stuff.

Fri May 17 11:49:11 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Refer to cvs.texinfo and say "filesystem" not "fs".

        * import.c (import_descend_dir): Check for a file in the
        repository which will be checked out to the same name as the
        directory.

Sun May  5 15:49:00 1996  Benjamin J. Lee  <benjamin@cyclic.com>

          define AUTH_SERVER_SUPPORT only if crypt() is found.

	* configure: Regenerated.

	* src/server.c (HAVE_INITGROUPS): Use initgroups() only if
        located by configure.

Wed May  1 15:38:56 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

        tools/Makefile, and tools/pcl-cvs/Makefile.  Do not any longer

        * Makefile.in: deal w/ above changes.
        
        * configure: regenerated.

        * Added `tools' subdir (pcl-cvs will live there, as will other
        things maintained along with the CVS distribution).

	not using the examples directory any more.

Wed Mar 13 17:02:00 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Refer to cvs.texinfo rather than out-of-date cvsinit
	instructions.  Instead of telling everyone to update modules
	whenever adding directories (which is optional), refer to the
	manual regarding all administrative files.  Revise "make check"
	instructions to be even less encouraging about submitting bug
	reports.

Fri Mar  1 09:21:56 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README.VMS: Remove distribution information (since it is no
	longer different for VMS).  Various wording fixes to reflect the
	fact that using rsh is just one of several ways to connect to a
	cvs server, not "the official" one.  Say that the unsuitable rsh
	is the UCX one.  Clarify what rsh uses privileged ports for.

Fri Mar  1 01:26:28 1996  Benjamin J. Lee  <benjamin@cyclic.com>

Tue Jan 30 16:09:53 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	cvsnt.mak which Visual C++ 4.0 will accept.
	* Rename lib/save-cwd.h to lib/savecwd.h for consistency.
	* os2/Makefile.in, lib/Makefile.in, lib/savecwd.c, src/add.c,

	releases; this will be an issue for few if any people.  Remove
	stuff about diff and --with-diffutils which is no longer true.

	* README: Refer to HACKING file.  Refer to cvs.texinfo not
	manpage.  Rewrite section about compatibility between CVS versions.
	* HACKING: New file.

Wed Jan 24 20:26:55 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* config.sub, config.guess: Removed.
	* src/options.h.in (DIFF): Change to "diff" and change comment to tell
	people not to use -a.
	* src/sanity.sh: New test binfiles tests for above-fixed bug (see
	comments in patch_file in update.c--passing -a to diff generates a
	patch which patch cannot apply).

	* NEWS: Adjust to reflect existence of 1.7.

Tue Jan 23 14:20:39 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* devel-cvs: New file, not to be included in the distribution.

Thu Jan 18 21:46:56 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Remove all mention of the outdated cyclic-cvs@cyclic.com
	and remote-cvs@cyclic.com addresses.  It turns out that people see
	these addresses and use them.  Mention the proper way to report
	bugs.

Wed Jan 17 16:40:01 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Fix typo (info-cvs-requests -> info-cvs-request).

Fri Jan 12 13:38:12 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in, configure: Revert "Checking user's gender" change.
	Sure, you only live once, but I want mine to be a *long* life, not
	one interrupted by a CVS user who is not amused coming after me
	with an axe.

Fri Jan 12 12:46:23 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

        * configure: regenerated.
        
        * configure.in: print "Checking user's gender... ok".  I mean,
        what the heck, you only live once.

Thu Jan 11 14:00:00 1996  Jim Kingdon  <peary.cyclic.com>

	* cvsnt.mak: Update dependencies.

Thu Jan 11 12:03:10 1996  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	  possibility to use "cvs" in .cvsrc.

        * configure: regenerated.

        * configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): added `macintosh/Makefile'.
        
        * Makefile.in (SUBDIRS): added `macintosh'.

	* README: Remove URL of obsolete David Zuhn web page.

	* configure.in: Don't set exec_prefix.  Set bindir from prefix if
	exec_prefix isn't set.
	* configure: Regenerated.

	* INSTALL: Update list of machines for 1.6.85 (further changes to
	the list of machines will not receive ChangeLog entries).

Tue Jan  9 09:02:05 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Mention changes in default ignore list.

	* INSTALL: check.log is not in /tmp/cvs-sanity.  Mention
	submitting bug reports as a possibility, not a request from us.
	Separate out "make check" a bit to make clear it is optional.

Mon Jan  8 11:42:40 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Remove grep stuff; no longer necessary.
	Don't say that patch must understand unidiffs; no longer true.
	Suggest configuring with -Wall (here until we have a "how to hack
	CVS document").

Wed Jan  3 19:00:00 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@peary.cyclic.com>

	* .cvsignore: Add cvsnt.vcp.

	language (like the newspapers have for letters to the editor).

Thu Dec 21 16:00:00 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@peary.cyclic.com>

	* cvsnt.mak: Revert to an old version, then add in recent changes
	to lists of files (using Visual C++; not by hand editing--this way
	it can be used as an internal project not just an external one).

Tue Dec 19 17:13:14 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Mention -kb (strictly speaking a bugfix, not a new
	feature, I guess, but it seems worth mentioning anyway).

Tue Dec 19 17:00:00 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@peary.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: Remove "regular TODO list:" line which accidentally got
	checked in.

Mon Dec 18 18:59:30 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (TAR_VERBOSE): Default to empty, not "v".  I don't
	want that whole long list of files any more than jimb's daily
	update script does.

Sun Dec 17 23:59:11 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): Remove vasprintf.

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_HEADERS): add sys/resource.h to list of
	  tested headers

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): add config.sub and config.guess

Thu Nov 23 09:01:53 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: Remove item about doc describing undoing a change; it
	already does.

Sun Nov 19 18:12:36 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (dist): Pull out the 'v' in the tar command to a
	variable, so I can disable it in my daily update script.

Tue Nov 14 18:31:36 1995  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* cvsinit.sh:
	- new rcs id
	- new opening comment
	- read only one "word" for CVSROOT
	- add checkoutlist, cvswrappers, taginfo, wrap, & unwrap to
	examples install loop, special handling for latter....
	- don't do any special stuff for loginfo -- always comment out
	everything in the newly installed examples
	- add a wee message to suggest editing newly installed examples
	- tweak some more comments, esp. regarding install of contrib
	scripts....
	- make $CVSROOT/CVROOT/history group writable if it didn't exist
	as it's not very useful otherwise

Tue Nov 14 15:22:25 1995  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* cvsinit.sh: woops!  wasn't installing contrib/log!

Tue Nov 14 12:09:11 1995  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* INSTALL: oops, missed a couple of things about "configure"

	* configure: re-ran autoconf

Tue Nov 14 11:06:25 1995  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* config.guess, config.sub: first time in (from autoconf-2.4)

	* configure.in:
	- updated to work with autoconf-2.4
	- call AC_CANONICAL_HOST to get host OS type right (needs
	config.sub and config.guess)
	- added full support for --with-diffutils and --with-gnugrep
	- fixed the diff search to work almost like the one for RCS-5.7
	- fixed some quoting problems

	* README: mention optional 'make check' step

	* INSTALL:
	- updated notes about working SunOS versions
	- re-wrote notes about RCS, diffutils, etc.

Thu Oct 19 16:26:32 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Remove note about RCS 5.7 and log messages
	consisting only of whitespace; fixed in CVS on 11 Jul 95.

Tue Oct 17 17:57:23 1995  Warren Jones  <wjones@tc.fluke.com>

	* man/cvs.5, examples/modules: Document -e.

Tue Oct 10 16:34:25 1995  Thorsten Lockert  <tholo@sigmasoft.com>

	* configure.in: More crud looking for kerberos, this time for 4.4BSD.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Sun Oct  8 12:22:19 1995  Peter Wemm  <peter@haywire.DIALix.COM>

	* configure.in: check for POSIX and BSD style reliable signals
	* configure: regenerated by autoconf
	* config.h.in: regenerated by autoheader

Fri Oct  6 21:50:48 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	There is little point in trying to share a file as trivial as
	lib/error.c between programs.  So just admit it is CVS specific:
	* lib/error.c: Move from here...
	* src/error.c: ...to here, and remove CVS_SUPPORT ifdefs.
	* lib/error.h: Move from here...
	* src/error.h: ...to here.  Remove CVS_SUPPORT
	ifdefs; remove unused variable error_message_count.
	* src/Makefile.in (OBJECTS): Add error.o.
	(SOURCES): Add error.c.
	(HEADERS): Add error.h.
	* lib/Makefile.in (OBJECTS): Remove error.o.
	(SOURCES): Remove error.c.
	(HEADERS): Remove error.h.
	* acconfig.h, configure.in: Remove CVS_SUPPORT.
	* configure, config.h.in: Rebuilt using autoconf and autoheader.
	* windows-NT/config.h: Remove CVS_SUPPORT.

Thu Oct  5 17:26:38 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Mention Siemens-Nixdorf RM600.

Tue Oct  3 09:32:19 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Remove item about -f global option; it is old news already
	mentioned elsewhere in the file.

Mon Oct  2 18:12:15 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* FAQ: Updated for CVS 1.5.  And now 1.6 is almost out.  The FAQ
        always lags the package, sigh...

Mon Oct  2 18:10:35 1995  Larry Jones  <larry.jones@sdrc.com>

	* configure, config.h.in: Rebuilt using autoconf and autoheader.

	* configure.in: check for <sys/bsdtypes.h>; used by src/server.c.
	(ISC keeps all the stuff that BSD has in <sys/types.h> here, so
	we need it for the FD_SET stuff for select().)
	Moved check for gethostname() after check for connect() since if
	connect() is not found, we may add librariesd and gethostname()
	may well be in one of those libraries.
	If connect() isn't found, look in -linet (ISC) in addition to
	-lsocket and -lnsl.  Also, ignore the cache since we need to
	update LIBS reguardless of whether it was found before or not and
	the answer may well be different afterwards.
	Define CLIENT_SUPPORT and SERVER_SUPPORT only if connect() is
	found.

	* INSTALL: update info for ISC 4.0.1; renumber footnotes.

Mon Oct  2 17:01:07 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Indicate CVS version tested with Solaris 2.4.

Mon Oct  2 10:42:37 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@totoro.cyclic.com>

        * (configure): Re-ran autoconf.

Mon Oct  2 10:33:58 1995  Michael Finken  <finken@conware.de>

        * configure.in: AC_REPLACE `strstr'.

Sun Oct  1 23:22:28 1995  Bryan O'Sullivan  <bos@serpentine.com>

	* (INSTALL): noted that CVS works fine on Solaris 2.4 with both
	  gcc and SPARCworks cc.

Sun Oct  1 18:48:19 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@totoro.cyclic.com>

        * (configure): re-ran autoconf following Peter Wemm's change
        below.

Sun Oct  1 22:24:56 1995  Peter Wemm  <peter@haywire.dialix.com>

	* configure.in: more extensive searching for -lsocket and -lnsl
	as done in Taylor-UUCP 1.06

Sun Oct  1 15:32:01 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@totoro.cyclic.com>

        * (configure): re-ran autoconf.

Sun Oct  1 11:35:17 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: Remove item about setting comment leader automatically;
	RCS 5.7 does this.

Wed Sep 27 15:34:04 1995  Peter Wemm  <peter@haywire.dialix.com>

	* configure.in: correct detection of GNU diff's -a option for
	src/options.h
	* configure: regenerate with autoconf

Fri Sep 22 14:29:31 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: Remove item about reindenting on the way in and out.
	wrappers provide this functionality.

Wed Sep 20 14:27:28 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

        * configure.in: #define the symbols DIFF and GREP to be the paths
	to the DIFF and GREP programs; their values will be edited into
	src/options.h (and config.h, coincidentally).
	* acconfig.h (DIFF, GREP): Add these.
	* configure, config.h.in: Rebuilt using autoconf and autoheader.

Sun Sep 10 21:38:05 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: CVS can already undo a change, suggest documenting how.
	Expand slightly on mode stuff.
	Remove item about not letting people check out into repository (it
	is done).
	Redo item about expanding env vars in *info to reflect current
	thinking.
	Remove item about making it hard to accidentally move tags; it is
	done.
	Add client/server note to suggestion regarding interactive merging.

Fri Sep  1 12:07:02 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Remove items about refetching unpatchable files and options.h.

Fri Sep  1 09:20:09 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Remove cvsnt.vcp; it's been deleted.

Thu Aug 31 13:47:35 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (stamp-h): Rebuild config.status before trying to
	use it to build config.h.

	* Makefile.in: Change "cd foo; make" to "cd foo && make";
	otherwise we get into an infinite loop if an objdir doesn't exist.

Thu Aug 31 11:07:06 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Arrange not to touch options.h if we haven't
	modified it.  AC_CONFIG_HEADER checks if the file is unmodified,
	whereas AC_OUTPUT doesn't, and they're otherwise identical, so...
	(AC_CONFIG_HEADER): ... mention src/options.h here...
	(AC_OUTPUT): ... not here.
	Copy src/options.h to src/options.h-SAVED, don't move it.
	Otherwise, configure will create it again every time.
	Remove the code to compare the new src/options.h with
	src/options.h-SAVED and move it back if it's unchanged; autoconf
	writes that for us now.

Wed Aug 30 18:45:28 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

        * .cvsignore: Ignore WinDebug and WinRel directories, used by
	Microsoft Visual C++ to store object files and executables.

	* acconfig.h (CVS_SUPPORT, CLIENT_SUPPORT, SERVER_SUPPORT): New
	symbols, which autoheader will use to build config.h.in from
	configure.in.
	* configure.in (SERVER_SUPPORT, CLIENT_SUPPORT): Remove spaces
	between AC_DEFINEs and opening parens of argument lists.  Oops.
	* configure: Rebuild using autoconf.
	* config.h.in: Rebuild using autoheader.

	* Makefile.in (SUBDIRS): Uncomment windows-NT.

	* INSTALL: Added Windows NT to list of supported platforms.
	Added Windows NT installation instructions.

Tue Aug 29 16:08:01 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* cvsnt.mak: Completed Windows NT port.

	* configure.in (SERVER_SUPPORT, CLIENT_SUPPORT): Arrange for these
	to get #defined.  In the config.h file for the Windows NT port, we
	only #define CLIENT_SUPPORT.
	* config.h.in (SERVER_SUPPORT, CLIENT_SUPPORT): Add #undefs for
        these.

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Build the Makefile for the windows-NT
	subdirectory too.

	* cvsnt.vcp: Removed.  This doesn't store any information needed
	to compile CVS; it seems to be mostly programmer preference stuff.
	There's no need to distribute it.

	* INSTALL: Added info about Harris Nighthawk from Steve Allen ---
	thanks!

Mon Aug 21 16:08:37 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

        Bring the saga to a close:
	* configure.in: Use AC_PROG_MAKE_SET here, to decide whether we
	need to set the MAKE variable in Makefile.
	* Makefile.in: Use @SET_MAKE@ here, to set MAKE when appropriate.

Mon Aug 21 15:26:29 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in: Add comment regarding AC_SET_MAKE.

Sat Aug 19 21:57:51 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Define CVS_SUPPORT, to tell certain library
	functions that they're part of CVS.
	* config.h.in: Add #undef for CVS_SUPPORT, for configure to chew
	on.

Fri Aug 18 22:35:34 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in: Don't set MAKE; apparently all makes set it and GNU
	make, at least, will set it to what make was invoked as (perhaps gmake
	or some such), not just "make" (which might not support VPATH, for
	example).

Sun Aug 13 23:35:47 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Convert Data General entry to same format as other entries.

Sun Aug 13 13:11:36 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* cvs-format.el: Add note about set-c-style.

Thu Aug  3 16:13:29 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Fixed mail address for updates.

        * INSTALL: Noted that 1.5 runs on SunOS 4.1.1 -- 4.1.3.

Sun Jul 30 20:12:26 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvsinit.sh: Unify code for modules and loginfo with code for
	other files which have checked-out and ,v files in CVSROOT.
	Don't add "#" to start of lines in rcstemplate.

Sat Jul 29 16:48:05 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvsinit.sh: If arguments are given, give version number and
	usage message.  Make printed messages much more concise.

	* cvsinit.sh: Rename log.pl to log.  Don't install log twice.

	* Makefile.in (install-local), contrib/Makefile.in (install):
	Remove "reminder" to run cvsinit; running cvsinit is not required.

Fri Jul 28 16:46:10 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (SUBDIRS): Comment out windows-NT.

Fri Jul 28 02:27:54 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add cvsnt.mak and cvsnt.vcp.
	(SUBDIRS): Add windows-NT.

	* config.h.in: Regenerated from configure.in by autoheader.

Wed Jul 19 18:00:00 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_HEADERS): Check for <io.h> and <direct.h>.

Tue Jul 18 21:18:00 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_HEADERS): Check for sys/param.h; Windows NT
	doesn't have it.

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_HEADERS): Check for sys/time.h.  If you're
	using AC_HEADER_TIME, it's best to check for this too.

	* cvsnt.mak: New file --- makefile equivalent for Microsoft Visual C++.
	Choose this as your project when working with CVS under MSVC++.
	* cvsnt.vcp: New file --- configuration info for Microsoft Visual C++.
	* windows-NT: New subdirectory, containing files to be used to
	build under Microsoft Windows NT.

Wed Jul 12 23:26:24 1995  James Kingdon	 <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in: Remove duplicate install-info rule.

Wed Jul 12 16:00:27 1995 Karl Fogel <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (install-local): added rule for install-info, made
	`install' depend on it.

	* README: correct mailing list addresses.
	* INSTALL: same.

Wed Jul 12 09:15:02 1995  Jim Meyering	(meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in (gdiff_path): Remove gdiff from the list of programs.
	SGI's Irix includes a program named gdiff that is an X-based GUI to
	diff.

	* configure.in: Add check for working fnmatch functions so that
	systems providing it don't incur the space overhead of linking
	with the version in lib.  Cross compiling builds always use the
	version in lib.

Tue Jul 11 15:47:20 1995  Greg A. Woods	 <woods@most.weird.com>

	* configure.in: add some FIXME comments
	- add a hack to restore src/options.h if AC_OUTPUT() didn't modify
	it. Note that this does *not* work for config.status, thus one
	FIXME comment.
	- add test for #! (to warn about possible failure of perl scripts
	- add test for diff and grep paths (for src/options.h.in)
	- fix up handling of src/options.h.in
	- add checks for PERL_PATH and CSH_PATH (from previous local changes)

Tue Jul 11 14:31:18 1995  Michael Shields  <shields@tembel.org>

	* Makefile.in (LDFLAGS): Pick up from configure.

Sun Jul	 9 19:03:00 1995  Greg A. Woods	 <woods@most.weird.com>

	* configure: re-ran autoconf-2.4

	* cvsinit.sh: make use of xVERSIONx from the Makefile
	- get rid of stuff duplicated in examples/* and use that instead

	* Makefile.in: $(VERSION) for cvsinit.sh wasn't set, so get it
	from src/version.c instead.

	* cvsinit.sh: install two more example CVSROOT control/config
	files: rcstemplate checkoutlist
	- install useful scripts from $CVSLIB/contrib too...
	(from previous local changes)

	* Makefile.in: add another reminder to run 'cvsinit' to update
	repository(ies) (from previous local changes)

Thu Jul	 6 17:53:55 1995  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* Makefile.in (mostlyclean-local): Remove $(PROGS).

Sat Jul	 1 13:11:41 1995  James Kingdon	 <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Version 1.5.1.

Thu Jun 29 01:02:09 1995  James Kingdon	 <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in, configure: cross_compiling gets set to "no", not
	empty--change test accordingly.

	* Version 1.4.93.

Wed Jun 28 22:33:54 1995  James Kingdon	 <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* lib/Makefile.in, man/Makefile.in, doc/Makefile.in: Comment out
	rules for configure and config.status, just like in Makefile.in or
	src/Makefile.in.

Tue Jun 27 19:53:05 1995  James Kingdon	 <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS), configure: Remove fnmatch.
	* lib/Makefile.in (OBJECTS): Add fnmatch.
	Avoids buggy Solaris 2.4 libc fnmatch.

	* FAQ: Updated with new version from ftp.odi.com.

Mon Jun 26 15:17:46 1995  James Kingdon	 <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Version 1.4.92.

Thu Jun 22 12:45:24 1995  James Kingdon	 <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Version 1.4.91.

Wed Jun 21 16:33:04 1995  James Kingdon	 <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* PROJECTS: New file.
	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add it.

Wed Jun 21 16:12:14 1995  James Kingdon	 <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (FLAGS_TO_PASS): Don't pass INSTALL to sub-makes.
	The reason for passing it is gone now that we are using autoconf
	2.x which will set INSTALL in the sub-makefiles correctly.

Tue Jun 20 18:14:54 1995  James Kingdon	 <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in, configure: Make sure src directory exists before
	trying to copy options.h to it.

Mon Jun 19 13:47:20 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in: Add a "remotecheck" target here, for consistency;
	people shouldn't have to switch to src before running the tests.

Mon Jun 19 10:08:03 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* INSTALL: Update list of machines tested.  Remove note about
	systems missing opendir--this is an autoconf issue, not something
	installers should have to worry about.	Refer to NEWS instead of
	ChangeLog.  No longer "strongly recommend" putting diff -a in
	options.h.

Fri Jun 16 22:30:03 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@cyclic.com)

	* Version 1.4.90.

	* configure, configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Add config/pcl-cvs/Makefile.

	* Makefile.in (dist): Rename dist from ccvs-<version> to cvs-<version>.

	* Makefile.in (dist, dist-dir), src/Makefile.in, doc/Makefile.in,
	examples/Makefile.in, contrib/Makefile.in,
	contrib/pcl-cvs/Makefile, man/Makefile.in, lib/Makefile.in
	(dist-dir): Use srcdir where appropriate.

Thu Jun 15 14:33:37 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@cyclic.com)

	* CYCLIC-CVS-FAQ: Removed.
	* Rename ChangeLog.fsf to NEWS.	 Add information about changes
	since 1.4A2.
	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Adjust accordingly.
	* README: Revise to reflect current status of releases.

Thu Jun 15 12:22:42 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@cyclic.com)

	* TODO: Remove various items already fixed.  Revise others.

Thu Jun 15 12:24:45 1995  J.T. Conklin	<jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Use AC_C_INLINE to handle inline.
	Reorganized to put compiler and OS checks first so that any
	special defines they might provide are used in subsequent tests.

	* configure, config.h.in: regenerated with autoconf and
	autoheader version 2.3.

Thu Jun	 8 16:33:51 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* INSTALL (Installation): Disrecommend RCS 5.6.[5-7].

Tue May 30 00:07:15 1995  Jim Meyering	(meyering@comco.com)

	* Makefile.in (distclean-local): Don't delete config.status here.
	(distclean): Delete config.status here instead, but only after
	recursive make invocations.  Otherwise, the new dependencies
	in */Makefile.in on ../config.status led to failure in each sub-make
	because there is no rule there to make ../config.status.
	Reported by Jeff Johnson <jbj@brewster.jbj.org>.
	(realclean): Likewise.

Mon May 29 22:24:28 1995  J.T. Conklin	<jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Use AC_HEADER_DIRENT instead of AC_DIR_HEADER.
	Use AC_HEADER_STAT to determine if S_FOO() macros work.
	Use AC_HEADER_TIME to determine if both <sys/time.h> and <time.h>
	can be included as recommend by autoconf manual.
	Remove AC_STRUCT_TM test, as above test is better.

	* configure, config.h.in: regenerated with autoconf and
	autoheader version 2.3.

Fri Apr 28 14:36:49 1995  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@kr-pc.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: Set "all" as default target instead of ".PHONY".
	Some versions of make will otherwise try building all of the phony
	targets, in order.

Mon May	 1 14:02:42 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* configure.in: Set up src/options.h for the user.  Its defaults are
	usually right.
	* README, INSTALL: Adjust installation instructions appropriately.

Fri Apr 28 22:31:26 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Brought up-to-date.
	(dist): Rewritten to use dist-dir targets, passing DISTDIR variable.
	(GZIP, GZIP_EXT): New variables.
	(dist-dir): New target.

	We don't want to include a file the user has to edit in the
	distribution.
	* src/options.h: No longer distributed.
	* src/options.h.in: Distribute this instead.
	* INSTALL, README: Installation instructions updated.

Sat Apr	 8 19:02:21 1995  Roland McGrath  <roland@baalperazim.frob.com>

	* configure.in: Check for fchdir.
	(connect check): Use AC_CHECK_LIB instead of (obsolete)
	AC_HAVE_LIBRARY.

Sat Apr	 8 14:52:46 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS): Let configure set the default for CFLAGS.
	Under GCC, we want -g -O.

Wed Feb	 8 06:49:49 1995  Roland McGrath  <roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (stamp-h): Pass CONFIG_FILES=$@ to config.status so
	the target is created.
	* configure.in: Applied `autoupdate' from Autoconf 2.1 to
	modernize macro usage.
	(AC_RSH): Call removed.	 It was obsolete and not doing anything useful.
	(AC_OUTPUT): Write stamp-h as the Makefile rules expect we will.
	(AC_TYPE_PID_T): Add this check.

Tue Nov	 8 06:26:54 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* Add stamp-h.in.  Remove it from .cvsignore.

Fri Oct 28 11:50:51 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

Tue Oct 25 17:44:13 1994  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (all, install, uninstall): Fail if make in
	subdirectory fails.

Tue Oct 18 13:26:15 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (FLAGS_TO_PASS): Pass INSTALL*.  Add comment about
	why we need to.

Tue Sep 27 08:27:06 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (SUBDIRS): Reinstate "contrib".
	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Add contrib/Makefile.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Tue Sep 27 01:03:59 1994  John Gilmore	(gnu@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (SUBDIRS):  Comment out "contrib".  Since we don't
	bother to configure it, we shouldn't make it either.

Wed Aug 10 14:52:57 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (FLAGS_TO_PASS): Don't include LIBS or CFLAGS twice.

	* configure.in: Include waitpid and memmove in AC_REPLACE_FUNCS
	list.  Don't check for memmove separately.
	* configure: Regenerated.
	* config.h.in: Regenerated for Mark's change.

Wed Aug 10 14:32:24 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* configure.in (KRB4): recognize --with-krb4=path. Also test for
	krb_get_err_text so src/main.c and src/client.c can deal
	appropriately.

Tue Aug	 9 15:49:07 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Check sizes of `long' and `int', needed for md5
	code.
	* acconfig.h: New file.	 Mention HAVE_KERBEROS, to keep autoheader
	happy.
	* configure, config.h.in: Regenerated.

Tue Jul 19 11:23:21 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@sanguine.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Check not only that krb.h exists, but that it will
	actually compile correctly.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Mon Jul 11 07:04:36 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Add comment re autoheader.

Tue Jun 28 22:09:23 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	already have connect.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Mon Jun 27 17:21:48 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@sanguine.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Correct "krb_libdir" to "${krb_libdir}".
	* configure: Regenerated.

Fri Jun	 3 10:15:24 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Check for -lsocket and -lnsl.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Fri May 27 18:12:43 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Add valloc to AC_REPLACE_FUNCS.	 Add getpagesize
	to AC_HAVE_FUNCS.  Check for krb.h and -lkrb.  If not found, look
	in /usr/kerberos if native.  If found somewhere, define
	HAVE_KERBEROS and also look for -ldes.	Substitute includeopt.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Fri Mar 11 13:11:51 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Check for <sys/select.h>; used by src/server.c.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Sun Jan	 9 12:04:15 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@kr-pc.cygnus.com)

	* configure: Regenerated.

Wed Dec 15 18:05:21 1993  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo@andros.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: add MAKEINFO to MDEFINES, pass down MDEFINES on all
