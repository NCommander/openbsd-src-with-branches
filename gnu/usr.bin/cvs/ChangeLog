Wed Jan 24 20:26:55 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Remove diff stuff.  Also remove AC_CANONICAL_HOST
	and bindir crud as that was the only place they were used.
	* config.h.in, configure: Regenerated.
	* config.sub, config.guess: Removed.
	* src/options.h.in (DIFF): Change to "diff" and change comment to tell
	people not to use -a.
	* src/sanity.sh: New test binfiles tests for above-fixed bug (see
	comments in patch_file in update.c--passing -a to diff generates a
	patch which patch cannot apply).

	* NEWS: Adjust to reflect existence of 1.7.

Tue Jan 23 14:20:39 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* devel-cvs: New file, not to be included in the distribution.

Thu Jan 18 21:46:56 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Remove all mention of the outdated cyclic-cvs@cyclic.com
	and remote-cvs@cyclic.com addresses.  It turns out that people see
	these addresses and use them.  Mention the proper way to report
	bugs.

Wed Jan 17 16:40:01 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Fix typo (info-cvs-requests -> info-cvs-request).

Fri Jan 12 13:38:12 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in, configure: Revert "Checking user's gender" change.
	Sure, you only live once, but I want mine to be a *long* life, not
	one interrupted by a CVS user who is not amused coming after me
	with an axe.

Fri Jan 12 12:46:23 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

        * configure: regenerated.
        
        * configure.in: print "Checking user's gender... ok".  I mean,
        what the heck, you only live once.

Thu Jan 11 14:00:00 1996  Jim Kingdon  <peary.cyclic.com>

	* cvsnt.mak: Update dependencies.

Thu Jan 11 12:03:10 1996  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	  possibility to use "cvs" in .cvsrc.

Wed Jan 10 20:40:23 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

        * configure: regenerated.

        * configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): added `macintosh/Makefile'.
        
        * Makefile.in (SUBDIRS): added `macintosh'.

Wed Jan 10 01:17:18 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Remove URL of obsolete David Zuhn web page.

	* FAQ: Replace entire file with short paragraph explaining the FAQ
	is dead.

	* configure.in: Don't set exec_prefix.  Set bindir from prefix if
	exec_prefix isn't set.
	* configure: Regenerated.

	* INSTALL: Update list of machines for 1.6.85 (further changes to
	the list of machines will not receive ChangeLog entries).

Tue Jan  9 09:02:05 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Mention changes in default ignore list.

	* INSTALL: check.log is not in /tmp/cvs-sanity.  Mention
	submitting bug reports as a possibility, not a request from us.
	Separate out "make check" a bit to make clear it is optional.

Mon Jan  8 11:42:40 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Remove grep stuff; no longer necessary.
	Don't say that patch must understand unidiffs; no longer true.
	Suggest configuring with -Wall (here until we have a "how to hack
	CVS document").

Wed Jan  3 19:00:00 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@peary.cyclic.com>

	* .cvsignore: Add cvsnt.vcp.

	language (like the newspapers have for letters to the editor).

Thu Dec 21 16:00:00 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@peary.cyclic.com>

	* cvsnt.mak: Revert to an old version, then add in recent changes
	to lists of files (using Visual C++; not by hand editing--this way
	it can be used as an internal project not just an external one).

Tue Dec 19 17:13:14 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Mention -kb (strictly speaking a bugfix, not a new
	feature, I guess, but it seems worth mentioning anyway).

Tue Dec 19 17:00:00 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@peary.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: Remove "regular TODO list:" line which accidentally got
	checked in.

Mon Dec 18 18:59:30 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (TAR_VERBOSE): Default to empty, not "v".  I don't
	want that whole long list of files any more than jimb's daily
	update script does.

Sun Dec 17 23:59:11 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): Remove vasprintf.

        <mike@twinpeaks.prc.com> port-in-progress.

Thu Dec  7 14:32:49 1995  Jim Meyering	(meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_HEADERS): add sys/resource.h to list of
	  tested headers

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): add config.sub and config.guess

Thu Nov 23 09:01:53 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: Remove item about doc describing undoing a change; it
	already does.

Sun Nov 19 18:12:36 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (dist): Pull out the 'v' in the tar command to a
	variable, so I can disable it in my daily update script.

Tue Nov 14 18:31:36 1995  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* cvsinit.sh:
	- new rcs id
	- new opening comment
	- read only one "word" for CVSROOT
	- add checkoutlist, cvswrappers, taginfo, wrap, & unwrap to
	examples install loop, special handling for latter....
	- don't do any special stuff for loginfo -- always comment out
	everything in the newly installed examples
	- add a wee message to suggest editing newly installed examples
	- tweak some more comments, esp. regarding install of contrib
	scripts....
	- make $CVSROOT/CVROOT/history group writable if it didn't exist
	as it's not very useful otherwise

Tue Nov 14 15:22:25 1995  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* cvsinit.sh: woops!  wasn't installing contrib/log!

Tue Nov 14 12:09:11 1995  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* INSTALL: oops, missed a couple of things about "configure"

	* configure: re-ran autoconf

Tue Nov 14 11:06:25 1995  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* config.guess, config.sub: first time in (from autoconf-2.4)

	* configure.in:
	- updated to work with autoconf-2.4
	- call AC_CANONICAL_HOST to get host OS type right (needs
	config.sub and config.guess)
	- added full support for --with-diffutils and --with-gnugrep
	- fixed the diff search to work almost like the one for RCS-5.7
	- fixed some quoting problems

	* README: mention optional 'make check' step

	* INSTALL:
	- updated notes about working SunOS versions
	- re-wrote notes about RCS, diffutils, etc.
	- added notes about configuring	with GNU diffutils and GNU grep

Thu Oct 19 16:26:32 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Remove note about RCS 5.7 and log messages
	consisting only of whitespace; fixed in CVS on 11 Jul 95.

Tue Oct 17 17:57:23 1995  Warren Jones  <wjones@tc.fluke.com>

	* man/cvs.5, examples/modules: Document -e.

Tue Oct 10 16:34:25 1995  Thorsten Lockert  <tholo@sigmasoft.com>

	* configure.in: More crud looking for kerberos, this time for 4.4BSD.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Sun Oct  8 12:22:19 1995  Peter Wemm  <peter@haywire.DIALix.COM>

	* configure.in: check for POSIX and BSD style reliable signals
	* configure: regenerated by autoconf
	* config.h.in: regenerated by autoheader

Fri Oct  6 21:50:48 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	There is little point in trying to share a file as trivial as
	lib/error.c between programs.  So just admit it is CVS specific:
	* lib/error.c: Move from here...
	* src/error.c: ...to here, and remove CVS_SUPPORT ifdefs.
	* lib/error.h: Move from here...
	* src/error.h: ...to here.  Remove CVS_SUPPORT
	ifdefs; remove unused variable error_message_count.
	* src/Makefile.in (OBJECTS): Add error.o.
	(SOURCES): Add error.c.
	(HEADERS): Add error.h.
	* lib/Makefile.in (OBJECTS): Remove error.o.
	(SOURCES): Remove error.c.
	(HEADERS): Remove error.h.
	* acconfig.h, configure.in: Remove CVS_SUPPORT.
	* configure, config.h.in: Rebuilt using autoconf and autoheader.
	* windows-NT/config.h: Remove CVS_SUPPORT.

Thu Oct  5 17:26:38 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Mention Siemens-Nixdorf RM600.

Tue Oct  3 09:32:19 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* NEWS: Remove item about -f global option; it is old news already
	mentioned elsewhere in the file.

Mon Oct  2 18:12:15 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* FAQ: Updated for CVS 1.5.  And now 1.6 is almost out.  The FAQ
        always lags the package, sigh...

Mon Oct  2 18:10:35 1995  Larry Jones  <larry.jones@sdrc.com>

	* configure, config.h.in: Rebuilt using autoconf and autoheader.

	* configure.in: check for <sys/bsdtypes.h>; used by src/server.c.
	(ISC keeps all the stuff that BSD has in <sys/types.h> here, so
	we need it for the FD_SET stuff for select().)
	Moved check for gethostname() after check for connect() since if
	connect() is not found, we may add librariesd and gethostname()
	may well be in one of those libraries.
	If connect() isn't found, look in -linet (ISC) in addition to
	-lsocket and -lnsl.  Also, ignore the cache since we need to
	update LIBS reguardless of whether it was found before or not and
	the answer may well be different afterwards.
	Define CLIENT_SUPPORT and SERVER_SUPPORT only if connect() is
	found.

	* INSTALL: update info for ISC 4.0.1; renumber footnotes.

Mon Oct  2 17:01:07 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Indicate CVS version tested with Solaris 2.4.

Mon Oct  2 10:42:37 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@totoro.cyclic.com>

        * (configure): Re-ran autoconf.

Mon Oct  2 10:33:58 1995  Michael Finken  <finken@conware.de>

        * configure.in: AC_REPLACE `strstr'.

Sun Oct  1 23:22:28 1995  Bryan O'Sullivan  <bos@serpentine.com>

	* (INSTALL): noted that CVS works fine on Solaris 2.4 with both
	  gcc and SPARCworks cc.

Sun Oct  1 18:48:19 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@totoro.cyclic.com>

        * (configure): re-ran autoconf following Peter Wemm's change
        below.

Sun Oct  1 22:24:56 1995  Peter Wemm  <peter@haywire.dialix.com>

	* configure.in: more extensive searching for -lsocket and -lnsl
	as done in Taylor-UUCP 1.06

Sun Oct  1 15:32:01 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@totoro.cyclic.com>

        * (configure): re-ran autoconf.

Sun Oct  1 11:35:17 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: Remove item about setting comment leader automatically;
	RCS 5.7 does this.

Wed Sep 27 15:34:04 1995  Peter Wemm  <peter@haywire.dialix.com>

	* configure.in: correct detection of GNU diff's -a option for
	src/options.h
	* configure: regenerate with autoconf

Fri Sep 22 14:29:31 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: Remove item about reindenting on the way in and out.
	wrappers provide this functionality.

Wed Sep 20 14:27:28 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

        * configure.in: #define the symbols DIFF and GREP to be the paths
	to the DIFF and GREP programs; their values will be edited into
	src/options.h (and config.h, coincidentally).
	* acconfig.h (DIFF, GREP): Add these.
	* configure, config.h.in: Rebuilt using autoconf and autoheader.

Sun Sep 10 21:38:05 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* TODO: CVS can already undo a change, suggest documenting how.
	Expand slightly on mode stuff.
	Remove item about not letting people check out into repository (it
	is done).
	Redo item about expanding env vars in *info to reflect current
	thinking.
	Remove item about making it hard to accidentally move tags; it is
	done.
	Add client/server note to suggestion regarding interactive merging.

Fri Sep  1 12:07:02 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* BUGS: Remove items about refetching unpatchable files and options.h.

Fri Sep  1 09:20:09 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Remove cvsnt.vcp; it's been deleted.

Thu Aug 31 13:47:35 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (stamp-h): Rebuild config.status before trying to
	use it to build config.h.

	* Makefile.in: Change "cd foo; make" to "cd foo && make";
	otherwise we get into an infinite loop if an objdir doesn't exist.

Thu Aug 31 11:07:06 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Arrange not to touch options.h if we haven't
	modified it.  AC_CONFIG_HEADER checks if the file is unmodified,
	whereas AC_OUTPUT doesn't, and they're otherwise identical, so...
	(AC_CONFIG_HEADER): ... mention src/options.h here...
	(AC_OUTPUT): ... not here.
	Copy src/options.h to src/options.h-SAVED, don't move it.
	Otherwise, configure will create it again every time.
	Remove the code to compare the new src/options.h with
	src/options.h-SAVED and move it back if it's unchanged; autoconf
	writes that for us now.

Wed Aug 30 18:45:28 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

        * .cvsignore: Ignore WinDebug and WinRel directories, used by
	Microsoft Visual C++ to store object files and executables.

	* acconfig.h (CVS_SUPPORT, CLIENT_SUPPORT, SERVER_SUPPORT): New
	symbols, which autoheader will use to build config.h.in from
	configure.in.
	* configure.in (SERVER_SUPPORT, CLIENT_SUPPORT): Remove spaces
	between AC_DEFINEs and opening parens of argument lists.  Oops.
	* configure: Rebuild using autoconf.
	* config.h.in: Rebuild using autoheader.

	* Makefile.in (SUBDIRS): Uncomment windows-NT.

	* INSTALL: Added Windows NT to list of supported platforms.
	Added Windows NT installation instructions.

Tue Aug 29 16:08:01 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* cvsnt.mak: Completed Windows NT port.

	* configure.in (SERVER_SUPPORT, CLIENT_SUPPORT): Arrange for these
	to get #defined.  In the config.h file for the Windows NT port, we
	only #define CLIENT_SUPPORT.
	* config.h.in (SERVER_SUPPORT, CLIENT_SUPPORT): Add #undefs for
        these.

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Build the Makefile for the windows-NT
	subdirectory too.

	* cvsnt.vcp: Removed.  This doesn't store any information needed
	to compile CVS; it seems to be mostly programmer preference stuff.
	There's no need to distribute it.

	* INSTALL: Added info about Harris Nighthawk from Steve Allen ---
	thanks!

Mon Aug 21 16:08:37 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

        Bring the saga to a close:
	* configure.in: Use AC_PROG_MAKE_SET here, to decide whether we
	need to set the MAKE variable in Makefile.
	* Makefile.in: Use @SET_MAKE@ here, to set MAKE when appropriate.

Mon Aug 21 15:26:29 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in: Add comment regarding AC_SET_MAKE.

Sat Aug 19 21:57:51 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in: Define CVS_SUPPORT, to tell certain library
	functions that they're part of CVS.
	* config.h.in: Add #undef for CVS_SUPPORT, for configure to chew
	on.

Fri Aug 18 22:35:34 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in: Don't set MAKE; apparently all makes set it and GNU
	make, at least, will set it to what make was invoked as (perhaps gmake
	or some such), not just "make" (which might not support VPATH, for
	example).

Sun Aug 13 23:35:47 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Convert Data General entry to same format as other entries.

Sun Aug 13 13:11:36 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* cvs-format.el: Add note about set-c-style.

Thu Aug  3 16:13:29 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* INSTALL: Fixed mail address for updates.

        * INSTALL: Noted that 1.5 runs on SunOS 4.1.1 -- 4.1.3.

Sun Jul 30 20:12:26 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvsinit.sh: Unify code for modules and loginfo with code for
	other files which have checked-out and ,v files in CVSROOT.
	Don't add "#" to start of lines in rcstemplate.

Sat Jul 29 16:48:05 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* cvsinit.sh: If arguments are given, give version number and
	usage message.  Make printed messages much more concise.

	* cvsinit.sh: Rename log.pl to log.  Don't install log twice.

	* Makefile.in (install-local), contrib/Makefile.in (install):
	Remove "reminder" to run cvsinit; running cvsinit is not required.

Fri Jul 28 16:46:10 1995  James Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (SUBDIRS): Comment out windows-NT.

Fri Jul 28 02:27:54 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add cvsnt.mak and cvsnt.vcp.
	(SUBDIRS): Add windows-NT.

	* config.h.in: Regenerated from configure.in by autoheader.

Wed Jul 19 18:00:00 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_HEADERS): Check for <io.h> and <direct.h>.

Tue Jul 18 21:18:00 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_HEADERS): Check for sys/param.h; Windows NT
	doesn't have it.

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_HEADERS): Check for sys/time.h.  If you're
	using AC_HEADER_TIME, it's best to check for this too.

	* cvsnt.mak: New file --- makefile equivalent for Microsoft Visual C++.
	Choose this as your project when working with CVS under MSVC++.
	* cvsnt.vcp: New file --- configuration info for Microsoft Visual C++.
	* windows-NT: New subdirectory, containing files to be used to
	build under Microsoft Windows NT.

Wed Jul 12 23:26:24 1995  James Kingdon	 <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in: Remove duplicate install-info rule.

Wed Jul 12 16:00:27 1995 Karl Fogel <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (install-local): added rule for install-info, made
	`install' depend on it.

	* README: correct mailing list addresses.
	* INSTALL: same.

Wed Jul 12 09:15:02 1995  Jim Meyering	(meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in (gdiff_path): Remove gdiff from the list of programs.
	SGI's Irix includes a program named gdiff that is an X-based GUI to
	diff.

	* configure.in: Add check for working fnmatch functions so that
	systems providing it don't incur the space overhead of linking
	with the version in lib.  Cross compiling builds always use the
	version in lib.

Tue Jul 11 15:47:20 1995  Greg A. Woods	 <woods@most.weird.com>

	* configure.in: add some FIXME comments
	- add a hack to restore src/options.h if AC_OUTPUT() didn't modify
	it. Note that this does *not* work for config.status, thus one
	FIXME comment.
	- add test for #! (to warn about possible failure of perl scripts
	- add test for diff and grep paths (for src/options.h.in)
	- fix up handling of src/options.h.in
	- add checks for PERL_PATH and CSH_PATH (from previous local changes)

Tue Jul 11 14:31:18 1995  Michael Shields  <shields@tembel.org>

	* Makefile.in (LDFLAGS): Pick up from configure.

Sun Jul	 9 19:03:00 1995  Greg A. Woods	 <woods@most.weird.com>

	* configure: re-ran autoconf-2.4

	* cvsinit.sh: make use of xVERSIONx from the Makefile
	- get rid of stuff duplicated in examples/* and use that instead

	* Makefile.in: $(VERSION) for cvsinit.sh wasn't set, so get it
	from src/version.c instead.

	* cvsinit.sh: install two more example CVSROOT control/config
	files: rcstemplate checkoutlist
	- install useful scripts from $CVSLIB/contrib too...
	(from previous local changes)

	* Makefile.in: add another reminder to run 'cvsinit' to update
	repository(ies) (from previous local changes)

Thu Jul	 6 17:53:55 1995  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* Makefile.in (mostlyclean-local): Remove $(PROGS).

Sat Jul	 1 13:11:41 1995  James Kingdon	 <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Version 1.5.1.

Thu Jun 29 01:02:09 1995  James Kingdon	 <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in, configure: cross_compiling gets set to "no", not
	empty--change test accordingly.

	* Version 1.4.93.

Wed Jun 28 22:33:54 1995  James Kingdon	 <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* lib/Makefile.in, man/Makefile.in, doc/Makefile.in: Comment out
	rules for configure and config.status, just like in Makefile.in or
	src/Makefile.in.

Tue Jun 27 19:53:05 1995  James Kingdon	 <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS), configure: Remove fnmatch.
	* lib/Makefile.in (OBJECTS): Add fnmatch.
	Avoids buggy Solaris 2.4 libc fnmatch.

	* FAQ: Updated with new version from ftp.odi.com.

Mon Jun 26 15:17:46 1995  James Kingdon	 <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Version 1.4.92.

Thu Jun 22 12:45:24 1995  James Kingdon	 <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Version 1.4.91.

Wed Jun 21 16:33:04 1995  James Kingdon	 <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* PROJECTS: New file.
	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add it.

Wed Jun 21 16:12:14 1995  James Kingdon	 <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (FLAGS_TO_PASS): Don't pass INSTALL to sub-makes.
	The reason for passing it is gone now that we are using autoconf
	2.x which will set INSTALL in the sub-makefiles correctly.

Tue Jun 20 18:14:54 1995  James Kingdon	 <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* configure.in, configure: Make sure src directory exists before
	trying to copy options.h to it.

Mon Jun 19 13:47:20 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in: Add a "remotecheck" target here, for consistency;
	people shouldn't have to switch to src before running the tests.

Mon Jun 19 10:08:03 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* INSTALL: Update list of machines tested.  Remove note about
	systems missing opendir--this is an autoconf issue, not something
	installers should have to worry about.	Refer to NEWS instead of
	ChangeLog.  No longer "strongly recommend" putting diff -a in
	options.h.

Fri Jun 16 22:30:03 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@cyclic.com)

	* Version 1.4.90.

	* configure, configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Add config/pcl-cvs/Makefile.

	* Makefile.in (dist): Rename dist from ccvs-<version> to cvs-<version>.

	* Makefile.in (dist, dist-dir), src/Makefile.in, doc/Makefile.in,
	examples/Makefile.in, contrib/Makefile.in,
	contrib/pcl-cvs/Makefile, man/Makefile.in, lib/Makefile.in
	(dist-dir): Use srcdir where appropriate.

Thu Jun 15 14:33:37 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@cyclic.com)

	* CYCLIC-CVS-FAQ: Removed.
	* Rename ChangeLog.fsf to NEWS.	 Add information about changes
	since 1.4A2.
	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Adjust accordingly.

Thu Jun 15 12:22:42 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@cyclic.com)

	* TODO: Remove various items already fixed.  Revise others.

Thu Jun 15 12:24:45 1995  J.T. Conklin	<jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Use AC_C_INLINE to handle inline.
	Reorganized to put compiler and OS checks first so that any
	special defines they might provide are used in subsequent tests.

	* configure, config.h.in: regenerated with autoconf and
	autoheader version 2.3.

Thu Jun	 8 16:33:51 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* INSTALL (Installation): Disrecommend RCS 5.6.[5-7].

Tue May 30 00:07:15 1995  Jim Meyering	(meyering@comco.com)

	* Makefile.in (distclean-local): Don't delete config.status here.
	(distclean): Delete config.status here instead, but only after
	recursive make invocations.  Otherwise, the new dependencies
	in */Makefile.in on ../config.status led to failure in each sub-make
	because there is no rule there to make ../config.status.
	Reported by Jeff Johnson <jbj@brewster.jbj.org>.
	(realclean): Likewise.

Mon May 29 22:24:28 1995  J.T. Conklin	<jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Use AC_HEADER_DIRENT instead of AC_DIR_HEADER.
	Use AC_HEADER_STAT to determine if S_FOO() macros work.
	Use AC_HEADER_TIME to determine if both <sys/time.h> and <time.h>
	can be included as recommend by autoconf manual.
	Remove AC_STRUCT_TM test, as above test is better.

	* configure, config.h.in: regenerated with autoconf and
	autoheader version 2.3.

Fri Apr 28 14:36:49 1995  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@kr-pc.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: Set "all" as default target instead of ".PHONY".
	Some versions of make will otherwise try building all of the phony
	targets, in order.

Mon May	 1 14:02:42 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* configure.in: Set up src/options.h for the user.  Its defaults are
	usually right.
	* README, INSTALL: Adjust installation instructions appropriately.

Fri Apr 28 22:31:26 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Brought up-to-date.
	(dist): Rewritten to use dist-dir targets, passing DISTDIR variable.
	(GZIP, GZIP_EXT): New variables.
	(dist-dir): New target.

	We don't want to include a file the user has to edit in the
	distribution.
	* src/options.h: No longer distributed.
	* src/options.h.in: Distribute this instead.
	* INSTALL, README: Installation instructions updated.

Sat Apr	 8 19:02:21 1995  Roland McGrath  <roland@baalperazim.frob.com>

	* configure.in: Check for fchdir.
	(connect check): Use AC_CHECK_LIB instead of (obsolete)
	AC_HAVE_LIBRARY.

Sat Apr	 8 14:52:46 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.bio.indiana.edu>

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS): Let configure set the default for CFLAGS.
	Under GCC, we want -g -O.

Wed Feb	 8 06:49:49 1995  Roland McGrath  <roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (stamp-h): Pass CONFIG_FILES=$@ to config.status so
	the target is created.
	* configure.in: Applied `autoupdate' from Autoconf 2.1 to
	modernize macro usage.
	(AC_RSH): Call removed.	 It was obsolete and not doing anything useful.
	(AC_OUTPUT): Write stamp-h as the Makefile rules expect we will.
	(AC_TYPE_PID_T): Add this check.

Tue Nov	 8 06:26:54 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* Add stamp-h.in.  Remove it from .cvsignore.

Fri Oct 28 11:50:51 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	subdirectory fails.

Tue Oct 18 13:26:15 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (FLAGS_TO_PASS): Pass INSTALL*.  Add comment about
	why we need to.

Tue Sep 27 08:27:06 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (SUBDIRS): Reinstate "contrib".
	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Add contrib/Makefile.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Tue Sep 27 01:03:59 1994  John Gilmore	(gnu@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (SUBDIRS):  Comment out "contrib".  Since we don't
	bother to configure it, we shouldn't make it either.

Wed Aug 10 14:52:57 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (FLAGS_TO_PASS): Don't include LIBS or CFLAGS twice.

	* configure.in: Include waitpid and memmove in AC_REPLACE_FUNCS
	list.  Don't check for memmove separately.
	* configure: Regenerated.
	* config.h.in: Regenerated for Mark's change.

Wed Aug 10 14:32:24 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* configure.in (KRB4): recognize --with-krb4=path. Also test for
	krb_get_err_text so src/main.c and src/client.c can deal
	appropriately.

Tue Aug	 9 15:49:07 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Check sizes of `long' and `int', needed for md5
	code.
	* acconfig.h: New file.	 Mention HAVE_KERBEROS, to keep autoheader
	happy.
	* configure, config.h.in: Regenerated.

Tue Jul 19 11:23:21 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@sanguine.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Check not only that krb.h exists, but that it will
	actually compile correctly.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Mon Jul 11 07:04:36 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Add comment re autoheader.

Tue Jun 28 22:09:23 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	already have connect.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Mon Jun 27 17:21:48 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@sanguine.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Correct "krb_libdir" to "${krb_libdir}".
	* configure: Regenerated.

Fri Jun	 3 10:15:24 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Check for -lsocket and -lnsl.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Fri May 27 18:12:43 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Add valloc to AC_REPLACE_FUNCS.	 Add getpagesize
	to AC_HAVE_FUNCS.  Check for krb.h and -lkrb.  If not found, look
	in /usr/kerberos if native.  If found somewhere, define
	HAVE_KERBEROS and also look for -ldes.	Substitute includeopt.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Fri Mar 11 13:11:51 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Check for <sys/select.h>; used by src/server.c.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Sun Jan	 9 12:04:15 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@kr-pc.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Check for timezone function, for NetBSD support.
	* configure: Regenerated.

Wed Dec 15 18:05:21 1993  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo@andros.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: add MAKEINFO to MDEFINES, pass down MDEFINES on all
