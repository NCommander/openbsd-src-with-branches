	* scc.c: Go back to using debuglog not outproc for
	most debugging messages.  Developer Studio tends to
	erase the outproc messages on an error.
	More playing around with projects.
	* README.txt: Describe results of this.  I am making
	grey (source controlled) file icons appear, which is
	exciting.

	Still some distance from being able to open a
	project, but that's what I'm playing with:
	* scc.c (SccOpenProject): Use outproc not debuglog
	for debugging messages.
	(SccGet): Add debugging messages.
	(SccAddFromScc): Implemented.
	(SccInitialize): Return AddFromScc in capabilities.
	* scc.c: Change out_proc to outproc for consistency.

	* scc.c: Add a bunch of things, to SccOpenProject,
	SccGetProjPath, and perhaps elsewhere.  The project
	stuff doesn't really work yet, but the outproc does.

	* scc.c (SCC_max_init_path, SCC_max_name): Added.
	(SccInitialize): Set and use more arguments.
	(SccUninitialize): Might want to check ferror here.
	(SccOpenProject): Print to debug log if we get here.

	* README.txt (TOOLS IMPLEMENTING THE SCC): New section.

Wed Feb 26 22:55:43 1997  David H. Hovemeyer <Hovemeyer_D@mediasoft.net>
			  and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* scc.c (SccGetVersion): Return the version number of the SCC
	spec; we don't get to pick what to return here.
	* README.txt: Update with current status.

Sat Feb 15 15:19:41 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in: New file.

	* README.txt: Clarify a little more what this stuff does (and more
	the point, does not) do.
