	* README: Add note about lack of need for rsh.  I don't know if

	confused by it.

	both *tofd and *fromfd to read_fd.
	(wnt_shutdown_server): Don't call _get_osfhandle; just use the
	argument as the socket.

Wed Sep  4 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@cyclic.com>

	* filesubr.c (mkdir_if_needed): mkdir on NT only takes one,
	not two, arguments.

Thu Aug 29 09:47:33 1996  Mark A. Solinski  <markso@mcs.com>
			  and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* filesubr.c (deep_remove_dir, unlink_file_dir): ENOENT can also

	* README: Add note about tab stop setting.

Fri Jun  7 13:07:37 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	SYSTEM_INITIALIZE to reflect change in ../src/main.c.

Mon Jun 03 01:00:08 1996  noel  <noel@BOAT_ANCHOR>

	* sanity.sh: include new tests from ../src/sanity.sh.

	* filesubr.c (copy_file): use open with O_CREAT instead of creat
 	so we can also use O_BINARY -- we don't want to do any LF -> CR/LF
 	translations when we copy files.

Fri May 17 11:53:13 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: In a few places it used to say "server" when it meant

	* sanity.sh: Hacked version of src/sanity.sh for use under
 	CYGWIN32.

	* filesubr.c (expand_wild): Since FindFirstFile and FindNextFile
 	don't return the pathname of a file, we need to keep track of it
 	ourselves.

	* options.h: Fix defines for DIFF and GREP. 

	* run.c (run_exec): Flush stdout and stderr so we end up with the
 	correct interleaving of output for sanity.sh.  This can be removed
 	later, if desired.

Wed May 15 23:51:49 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle.rain.org>

Mon Mar 18 14:54:50 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* config.h: Don't declare gethostname; main.c already includes
	winsock.h.  Define FILENAMES_CASE_INSENSITIVE.

Fri Mar 15 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@cyclic.com>

	* filesubr.c (fncmp): Fix typo (n1 -> n2) which had caused the
	function to always return 0.

Mon Feb 12 03:33:27 1996  Benjamin J. Lee  <benjamin@cyclic.com>

Mon Dec 11 12:43:35 1995  adamg  <adamg@microsoft.com>

	* config.h: Add INITIALIZE_SOCKET_SUBSYSTEM macro to ensure that
	winsock is initialized early enough for the gethostname() in
	main.c to succeed.
	* rcmd.c: Remove from init_winsock(), and rcmd() code that
	initialized winsock on demand.

Thu Dec  7 14:49:16 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	Update callers.

Mon Dec  4 10:46:31 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* The following change was copied from src/filesubr.c.  This is
	because we need filesubr.c to compile, not because we are trying
	to make set*id work on NT (if it even has set*id).
	* filesubr.c (isaccessable): new function.  Checks access-rights
	for files like access(), but is getxid-safe.  Falls back to
	access() if SETXID_SUPPORT is not enabled.
	(isfile): replace stat() by isaccessable(file, F_OK)
	(isreadable): replace access() by isaccessable()

Wed Oct 25 07:40:17 1995  Noel Cragg  <noel@virtual.office.com>

	* startserver.c (wnt_start_server): removed NTOHS call; since the
	resulting number was passed as the port number to rcmd which
	called NTOHS again, we did a complicated NOOP.

Tue Oct 24 10:59:03 1995  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* Makefile.in: insert autoconf variables. This allows e.g. make
	  dist to work when configure was called from within a subdir.
