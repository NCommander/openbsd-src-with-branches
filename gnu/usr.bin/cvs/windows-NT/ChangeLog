	* filesubr.c (link_file): New function.

Fri Dec 22 12:00:00 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@peary.cyclic.com>

	* run.c (filter_stream_through_program): On error, error() rather
	than returning -1.

Thu Dec 21 16:00:00 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@peary.cyclic.com>

	* options.h: Don't define NO_SOCKET_TO_FD.

Mon Dec 18 09:57:29 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* options.h: Explain NO_SOCKET_TO_FD some more.

Sun Dec 17 21:19:18 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * options.h (NO_SOCKET_TO_FD): define to 1.

Tue Dec 12 19:18:00 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * options.h (AUTH_CLIENT_SUPPORT, AUTH_SERVER_SUPPORT): these
        replace CVS_LOGIN.
        (RCSBIN_DFLT): expand comment.

Mon Dec 11 12:43:35 1995  adamg  <adamg@microsoft.com>

	* config.h: Add INITIALIZE_SOCKET_SUBSYSTEM macro to ensure that
	winsock is initialized early enough for the gethostname() in
	main.c to succeed.
	* rcmd.c: Remove from init_winsock(), and rcmd() code that
	initialized winsock on demand.

Thu Dec  7 14:49:16 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* filesubr.c (isaccessible): Rename from isaccessable.
	Update callers.

Mon Dec  4 10:46:31 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* The following change was copied from src/filesubr.c.  This is
	because we need filesubr.c to compile, not because we are trying
	to make set*id work on NT (if it even has set*id).
	* filesubr.c (isaccessable): new function.  Checks access-rights
	for files like access(), but is getxid-safe.  Falls back to
	access() if SETXID_SUPPORT is not enabled.
	(isfile): replace stat() by isaccessable(file, F_OK)
	(isreadable): replace access() by isaccessable()
	(iswritable): ditto
	(make_directory): rename local variable buf to sb

Fri Nov 24 11:17:16 EST 1995  Boleslaw Ciesielski  <bolek@viewlogic.com>

	* filesubr.c (convert_file): Pass S_IWRITE to open when creating
	file (fixes problem with deleting temporary files).

Fri Nov 24 11:12:47 1995  Boleslaw Ciesielski  <bolek@viewlogic.com>

	* run.c (build_command): Move len++ inside loop, to make room for
	spaces between arguments.

Thu Oct 26 10:12:51 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Say that patch is required, not optional.

Wed Oct 25 07:40:17 1995  Noel Cragg  <noel@virtual.office.com>

	* startserver.c (wnt_start_server): removed NTOHS call; since the
	resulting number was passed as the port number to rcmd which
	called NTOHS again, we did a complicated NOOP.

Tue Oct 24 10:59:03 1995  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* Makefile.in: insert autoconf variables. This allows e.g. make
	  dist to work when configure was called from within a subdir.

	* Makefile.in (dist): replace by rule which honors $(srcdir)

Mon Oct 23 18:51:49 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * Makefile.in (clean): new rule, does nothing but satisfy
        top-level Makefile's beliefs about what its children can do.

Fri Oct 20 11:09:55 1995  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* config.h: use same layout and comments as current ../config.h.in

	distributions).

Thu Oct  5 17:28:52 1995  Kevin Layer  <layer@franz.com>

	* filesubr.c: Add semicolon after USE.

Thu Sep 7  19:18:00 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@cyclic.com>

	* config.h (CVS_SUPPORT): #define this.

	* ndir.c (opendir): Make the directory name argument a const
	char *, instead of just a char *.
	* ndir.h (opendir): Extern declaration changed to match.

Thu Aug 31 12:00:08 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (HEADERS, SOURCES): New variables.
	(DISTFILES): Refer to them, and include README, Makefile.in, and
	.cvsignore.

	* filesubr.c (unlink_file_dir, deep_remove_dir): New functions,
	originally added to src/filesubr.c and then adapted here for
	Windows NT.

Wed Jul 19 18:00:00 1995  Jim Blandy <jimb@cyclic.com>

	* alloca.h: New file.

	* config.h (HAVE_IO_H): Define this.

Tue Jul 18 21:18:00 1995  Jim Blandy <jimb@cyclic.com>

	* config.h, options.h, pwd.h: New files.
