	     Concurrent Versions System (CVS) Version 1.5
		    ported to Microsoft Windows NT
			   Cyclic Software

Cyclic Software has ported the client side of CVS 1.5 to Windows NT.
The port implements the full set of CVS commands, but cannot access
repositories located on the local machine.  The repository must live
on another machine (a Unix box, say) which runs a complete port of
CVS.

Source code for the port is available from Cyclic Software as:

	ftp://ftp.cyclic.com/pub/cvs/windows-nt/cvs-1.5nt.tar.gz

That includes documentation, in Texinfo and PostScript.  It's all
distributed as a gzipped tar file instead of a .ZIP file because, as
far as I can tell, PKZIP insists on munging long file names, which
would confuse the makefile for Visual C++.

To compile, use Microsoft Visual C++ on the file cvsnt.mak in the
distribution's top directory.  We haven't tested it under any other
development environments.  If you're curious, see below about the
warnings you may encounter.

We've put a Windows NT 80x86 executable for CVS in the same directory
as the source distribution, called cvs.exe.  Full documentation is
present in PostScript format in the source distribution.  Generally,
we'd like to avoid spending much time on binary distributions.

Please send bug reports to bug-cvs@prep.ai.mit.edu.  I can't promise
to fix them --- paying work must come first --- but the reports will
not be tossed, and I'll see what I can do.

This port passes the test in src/sanity.sh.  (We ran the checks by
hand, since we couldn't find a port of the Bourne shell good enough to
execute the script).  Sanity.sh provides pretty minimal feature
coverage, but still gives me some confidence it isn't totally broken.

For best results, you will also need GNU patch and GZIP installed on
your system, although CVS can be used without them.  The Congruent
ports of these packages to Windows NT, binary and source, are
available in:

	ftp://microlib.cc.utexas.edu/microlib/nt/gnu

At the moment, this port isn't integrated into our mainline CVS
sources, but I expect that to be straightforward.  I'll get around to
it soon, but as I said, paying work...

Now, strictly speaking, I don't *know* that this port won't correctly
access repositories on the local machine.  I haven't tried it.  I
have put calls to abort in places I'm pretty sure are wrong.  If you'd
like to finish it off and post patches, Morten Hindsholm's port of CVS
1.4A2 to Windows NT might be helpful; it is available as

	ftp://ftp.digex.net/pub/access/schueman/cvs/cvsnt14b.zip



I get the following warnings when compiling this port of CVS 1.5 under
Microsoft Visual C++.  They are all harmless.

- main.c: This is a very weird warning message!  If you understand
  what it's trying to say, let me know:
	'void (__cdecl *)(void)' differs in parameter lists from
	'void (__cdecl *)(void )'
  Okay, whatever, man.
- sighandle.c: These are harmless conflicts in the arguments of
  pointed-to functions.  You're welcome to submit patches for them.
- regex.c: These are signed/unsigned comparison conflicts.  I am not
  going to *touch* this code. :-) I got my fill of it when I was
  hacking GNU Emacs.
