This file formerly contained a CVS FAQ, maintained by David Grubbs.
However, it has been out of date for a long time, he officially gave up
maintaining it in the fall of 1995, and noone else has taken it over.
Most of the information which used to be in it can be found in the CVS
manual, doc/cvs.texinfo in this distribution.  For information on
questions like "what is the latest version of CVS?" and "what about GUIs
for CVS?", see the CVS web site,
http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs-index.html.  There are many web sites on
Configuration Management packages (of which CVS is an example); for
example see

or http://www.iac.honeywell.com/Pub/Tech/CM/index.html.
