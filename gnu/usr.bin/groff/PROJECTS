Here are some things that would be useful additions to groff:

  grap

  -mv macros (for typesetting viewgraphs and slides)

  a deroff that understands long names

  a page-makeup postprocessor and associated macro package
  (like pm and -mpm)

  a complete, self-contained manual (trent@cs.pdx.edu is working on this)

If you want to work on one of these, I suggest you contact me first.
