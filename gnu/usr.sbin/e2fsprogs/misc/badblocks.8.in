.SH DESCRIPTION
.B badblocks
is used to search for bad blocks on a device (usually a disk partition).
.br
.I device
is the special file corresponding to the device (e.g /dev/hdXX).
.br
.I blocks-count
is the number of blocks on the device.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I -b block-size
Specify the size of blocks in bytes.
.TP
.I -o output_file
Write the list of bad blocks to the specified file. Without this option,
.B badblocks
displays the list on its standard output.
.TP
.I -v
Verbose mode.
.TP
.I -w
Use write-mode test. With this option,
.B badblocks
scans for bad blocks by writing some patterns (0xaa, 0x55, 0xff, 0x00) on
every block of the device, reading every block and comparing the contents.
.SH WARNING
Never use the `-w' option on an device containing an existing file system.
This option erases data!
.SH AUTHOR
.B badblocks
has been written by Remy Card <card@masi.ibp.fr>, the developer and maintainer
of the ext2 fs.
.SH BUGS
I had no chance to make reals tests of this program since I use IDE drives
which remap bad blocks. I only made some tests on floppies.
.SH AVAILABILITY
.B badblocks
is available for anonymous ftp from ftp.ibp.fr and tsx-11.mit.edu in
/pub/linux/packages/ext2fs.
