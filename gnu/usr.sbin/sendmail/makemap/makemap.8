.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
creates the database maps used by the keyed map lookups in
.Xr sendmail 8 .
It reads input from the standard input
and outputs them to the indicated
.Ar mapname .
.Pp
Depending on how it is compiled,
.Nm
handles up to three different database formats,
selected using the
.Ar maptype
parameter.
They may be
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Li dbm
DBM format maps.
This requires the
.Xr ndbm 3
library.
.It Li btree
B-Tree format maps.
This requires the new Berkeley DB
library.
.It Li hash
Hash format maps.
This also requires the Berkeley DB
library.
.El
.Pp
In all cases,
.Nm
reads lines from the standard input consisting of two
words separated by whitespace.
The first is the database key,
the second is the value.
The value may contain
``%\fIn\fP''
strings to indicated parameter substitution.
Literal percents should be doubled
(``%%'').
Blank lines and lines beginning with ``#'' are ignored.
.Pp
Notice: do
.Em not
use
.Nm
to create the aliases data base, but
.Xr newaliases 8
which puts a special token into the data base that is required by
.Xr sendmail 8 .
.Pp
If the
.Li TrustedUser
option is set in the sendmail configuration file and
.Nm
is invoked as root, the generated files will be owned by
the specified
.Li TrustedUser .
.Ss Flags
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl C Ar file
Use the specified
.Xr sendmail 8
configuration
.Ar file
for looking up the
.Li TrustedUser
option.
.It Fl N
Include the null byte that terminates strings
in the map.
This must match the
.Fl N
flag in the sendmail.cf
.Dq K
line.
.It Fl c
Use the specified hash and B-Tree cache size.
.It Fl D
Use to specify the character to use to indicate a comment (which is ignored)
instead of the default of
.Sq # .
.It Fl d
Allow duplicate keys in the map.
This is only allowed on B-Tree format maps.
If two identical keys are read,
they will both be inserted into the map.
.It Fl e
Allow empty value (right hand side).
.It Fl f
Normally all upper case letters in the key
are folded to lower case.
This flag disables that behaviour.
This is intended to mesh with the
.Fl f
flag in the
.Dq K
line in sendmail.cf.
The value is never case folded.
.It Fl l
List supported map types.
.It Fl o
Append to an old file.
This allows you to augment an existing file.
.It Fl r
Allow replacement of existing keys.
Normally
.Nm
complains if you repeat a key,
and does not do the insert.
.It Fl s
Ignore safety checks on maps being created.
This includes checking for hard or symbolic
links in world writable directories.
.It Fl t
Use the specified delimiter instead of white space
(also for dumping a map).
.It Fl u
dump (unmap) the content of the database to standard output.
.It Fl v
Verbosely print what it is doing.
