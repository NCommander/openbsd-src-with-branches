This directory contains the source files for mail.local.

This is not intended to be used on *stock* System V derived systems such as
Solaris or HP-UX, since they use a totally different approach to mailboxes
(essentially, they have a setgid program rather than setuid, and they rely
on the ability to "give away"  files to do their work).

If you choose to run *this* mail.local on these systems then you may also
need to replace the existing MUAs, as well as IMAP and POP servers, with
ones that are compatible with the BSD interface.  You have been warned!

For systems with maillock() support, compile with -DMAILLOCK and link with
-lmail to use the maillock() routines.  This can be accomplished in your
site.config.m4 file with:

	APPENDDEF(`conf_mail_local_ENVDEF', `-DMAILLOCK')
	APPENDDEF(`conf_mail_local_LIBS', `-lmail')

Defining CONTENTLENGTH (-DCONTENTLENGTH) will build a mail.local which
outputs a Content-Length: header.  Solaris 2.3 and later will automatically
include Content-Length: support.  This can be accomplished in your
site.config.m4 file with:

	APPENDDEF(`conf_mail_local_ENVDEF', `-DCONTENTLENGTH')

Defining MAILGID to a 'gid' (-DMAILGID=6) will cause mailboxes to be
written group writable and with group 'gid'.  This can be accomplished in
your site.config.m4 file with:

	APPENDDEF(`conf_mail_local_ENVDEF', `-DMAILGID=6')

mail.local will not be installed setuid root. To use it as local
delivery agent without LMTP mode, use:

	 MODIFY_MAILER_FLAGS(`LOCAL', `+S')

in the .mc file.
