**  SM_VSPRINTF -- format data for "output" into a string
**
**	Assigned 'str' to a "fake" file pointer. This allows common
**	o/p formatting function sm_vprintf() to be used.
**
**	Parameters:
**		str -- location for output
**		fmt -- format directives
**		ap -- data unit vectors for use by 'fmt'
**
**	Results:
**		result from sm_io_vfprintf()
**
**	Side Effects:
**		Quietly limits the size to INT_MAX though this may
**		not prevent SEGV's.
