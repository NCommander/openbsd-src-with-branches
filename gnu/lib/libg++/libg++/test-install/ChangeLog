Thu Oct 19 21:39:12 1995  Fred Fish  <fnf@fishfood.amigalib.com>

	* Makefile.in:  Remove extraneous tabs from otherwise empty
	line.  This confuses older non-GNU versions of "make".

Fri Apr 15 13:25:09 1994  Per Bothner  (bothner@kalessin.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (COMPILE_FLAGS):  Remove obsolete XTRAFLAGS.

Tue Jun  1 16:54:46 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (do_main.diff):  Prefix commands by '@' to avoid
	unnecessarily alarming users with what looks like error messages.

Mon Apr 19 00:25:36 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in:  Re-vamped configure scheme.
	* Makefile.in (foo_main.diff):  Print more expressive
	error message, and refer to libg++/README.

Tue Nov 17 22:20:02 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* bf.cc:  Use different styles of initialization.
	* bm.cc:  $#include <stdlib.h> (for exit()).

Wed Aug 12 00:37:34 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  da should be libked with libg++.a, but
	foo_main.run should not be (since it tests that
	constructors work *without* needing libg++.a).

Thu May 14 15:13:31 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* foo_main.cc, foo_diff.cc:  Change the strings naming the
	two static static_foo variables to be the same, because
	the language does not specify construction order.
	* expected.out:  Update accordingly.
	* Makefile.in:  Simplify, clean up.  Now, if you 'make test-90S',
	it will test using ../libg++.a and local include files.
	But ../Makefile.in when testing installation, overrides
	variables so as to use installed versions.  Thus things
	are more consistent and more flexible - and you can
	do the test before installing, if you want to.

Sat Mar  7 19:19:49 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: make test work when "." is not in PATH.

Wed Feb 26 18:04:40 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: removed traces of namesubdir,
	  -subdirs, $(subdir), $(unsubdir), some rcs triggers.  Forced
	  copyrights to '92, changed some from Cygnus to FSF.

Mon Jan  6 00:39:54 1992  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* foo_main.cc:  Reverse previous change.  foo_main.cc should
	never see SunOS assert.h; it should get gcc's assert.h.  When
	the compile fails, it means the wrong include files are in use!

Mon Jan  6 00:21:13 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* foo_main.cc:  Include <stdio.h>, needed by broken SunOS assert.h.

Fri Jan  3 09:17:17 1992  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Cope with broken Sun Make VPATH.
	* Foo.cc:  Expect that Foo:init_foo() will *not* be called.
	* foo_main.cc:  Add comment about __init_start lossage.
	* expected.out:  Remove ``expected'' __init_start call.

Sat Dec 28 16:46:25 1991  Michael Tiemann  (tiemann at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (CPP_FLAGS): Add $(srcdir).
