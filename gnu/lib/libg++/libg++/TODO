* See iostream/TODO for iostream-specific issues

* Update README.

* Add 'return 0' to end of tests.
[Not needed, if ANSI makes that implicit.]

* Undo gcc-2.3.2-specific kludge in test-install/bf.cc.

* Remove use of _libgxx_io_ob from Fix.cc.

* Since the libg++ include files in gxx_includedir aren't architecture
  dependent, they belong under $(datadir) not $(libdir).
