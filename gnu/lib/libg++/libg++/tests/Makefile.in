# compilation notes:
# The following g++ warnings are expected to appear:
#
# 2. Several warnings from genclass about classes with only .h, no .cc files
#
# 3. A few harmless reminder warnings that some classes have no data members.
#
# 4. Many harmless warnings that arguments to vector-delete are unnecessary
#    when deleting arrays of builtin types.

#--- NOTE: Lots of stuff gets added by ${srcdir}/Makefile.sh
