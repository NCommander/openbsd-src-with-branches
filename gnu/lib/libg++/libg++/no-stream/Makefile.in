# This is a dummy io directory, with nothing to build.
# This is used by setting IO_DIR=no=stream when building libg++.
# The effect is that iostream does not get built, installed, or used.
# This is useful when:
# a) You're using some other C++ compiler that comes with its own iostreams.
# b) You're using iostream/stdio in your C-library.  In that case,
# you will install iostream as part of your C-library, not as part of libg++.
