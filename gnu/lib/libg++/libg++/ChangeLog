	* configure.in:  Always automatically generate a target Makefile

	and aix.mt (for more recent versions).
	* config/isc.mt:  New file.

	configure.in, don't try to install the test-install directory.

	work if there is a pre-existing fragment.
	* Makefile.in:  Re-order INSTALLDIR.

Mon May  3 11:45:41 1993  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* config.shared: Added missing quotes around TOUCH_ON_COMPILE.

	* config.shared:  If TOUCH_ON_COMPILE is defined (at configure
	time), make sure to 'touch stamp' on every compile.
	This prevents unneeded re-builing of libg++.a.

Wed Apr 28 11:44:05 1993  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* config.shared (MAKEOVERRIDES): Define to be empty.

Fri Apr 23 11:31:01 1993  Brendan Kehoe  (brendan@lisa.cygnus.com)

Sun Apr 18 23:54:45 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in and configure.in all directories, config.shared:

	* utils/gen-params: Define _G_MATH_H_INLINES.  Based only on
	arguments to gen-params; no test yet.
	* config/sco4.mt, config/hpux.mt (G_CONFIG_ARGS): pass
	MATH_H_INLINES as 1.

	* Makefile.in: pass $(FLAGS_TO_PASS) to all calls to make.

Mon Dec 28 12:07:11 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* utils/gen-params: added check for CURSES_FORMAT_ARG, which
	differs from system to system.

	* configure.in: for SCO 3.2v4 use sco4.
	* config/sco4.mh: new file: SCO header files are C++ ready, and
	SCO curses doesn't work with libg++ curses.

Tue Dec 22 14:58:04 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* utils/gen-params:  At end, delete all temporary files.
	* configure.in:  Don't bother linking lgpl.texinfo.
	Clean up temp.o when done.
	* Makefile.in:  Set version number to 2.3.1.
	* Makefile.in (*clean rules):  Use ALL_SUBDIRS, which includes
	old-stream and no-stream.
	* Makefile.in:  Add dependencies for libg++.a, to support
	parallel makes.

Tue Dec 15 14:45:05 1992  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo at cirdan.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: configure based on target, instead of host.  This
	was a simple text substitution, which also involved renaming:

	* config/{hpux.mt,linux.mt,rs6000.mt,solaris2.mt}: renamed from .mh

Sat Dec 12 00:05:42 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  No longer use HAVE_CPLUS_EXTERN; we can use
	WRAP_C_INCLUDES instead.  This should be somewhat more robust,
	since we only depend on WRAP_C_INCLUDES being over-ridden.
	* configure.in:  Don't generate HAVE_CPLUS_EXTERN.

Wed Dec  9 15:08:34 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Set version to 2.3.
	* README, NEWS, TODO: Various updates.

	* Makefile.in (dist):  Use new ../etc directory for config stuff.

Thu Dec  3 20:03:05 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Bump to version 2.2.95.
	* Makefile.in (distclean, realclean):  Don't delete
	Makefile until *after* recursive makes.
	* Makefile.in:  Add a kludge to reconcile FSF/Cygnus conflict.

Fri Nov 20 15:34:27 1992  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo at cirdan.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (install): don't change permissions on all info files,
	just the ones that get installed by this Makefile

Fri Nov 20 14:34:52 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* configure.in:  Add etc/fib to subdirs.
	* configure.in, config/{linux,solaris2}.mh: Fix typo
	INSTALLDATA -> INSTALL_DATA.

	* Makefile.in:  Bump to 2.2.92.
	* Makefile.in (install):  Use $(FLAGS_TO_PASS).

	* utils/gen-params:  More "robust" sed patterns for extracting
	type definitions.

Sat Nov  7 19:45:42 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* config/solaris2.mh:  New file, for Sun's Solaris2 OS.
	* configure.in:  Use it.

Thu Nov  5 18:45:53 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Bump to version 2.1.91.
	* Makefile.in, */Makefile.in, etc:  Replace ${C++} and
	${C++FLAGS} by ${CXX} and ${CXXFLAGS}.  (Some versions of
	'make' do not like '+' in variable names.)
	* Makefile.in (install):  Fix typo (chmod directory).

Mon Nov  2 13:20:54 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Don't pass $(NOSTDINC) as part of $(CC).
	* Makefile.in (dist):  include/demangle.h is also needed.

Sun Nov  1 16:25:00 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, */Makefile.in, etc:  Use ${C++} (and ${C++FLAGS})
	to compile C++ programs, not ${CC}.
	* Makefile.in:  Bump to version 2.2.90.
	* Makefile.in:  Use FLAGS_TO_PASS more consistently.

Sat Oct 31 19:24:05 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* libg++.texinfo:  Fix a number of typos (from
	meyering@cs.utexas.edu (Jim Meyering)).

Fri Oct  9 16:44:30 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at PersSony)

	* Makefile.in:  Fixed rule for building libg++.a to not do
	anything if everyting is up-to-date, using a stamp-libg++.a
	indicator file.

Tue Sep 29 15:47:05 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* COPYING, COPYING-LIB: Removed (- use versions in ..).
	* README: Update accordingly.

Fri Sep 25 11:28:24 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* utils/gen-params:  Define the type names (such as _G_size_t)
	using typedefs, not macros.
	* utils/gen-params:  Add commented-out hook for turning
	off use of templates (for old compilers).

Thu Oct  1 23:53:29 1992  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo at cirdan.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: use cpu-vendor-os triple instead of nested cases

Tue Sep 29 12:07:35 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* utils/gen-params: do the stdarg test with C++, not C, since
	otherwise a type incompatibility is only a warning.

Tue Sep 15 15:43:35 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (install): install libg++.a in $(INSTALLDIR), which
	defaults to $(libdir), not $(tooldir).  Default $(gxx_includedir)
	to $(tooldir/g++-include; the g++-include directory is currently
	target dependent because of the _G_config.h file.  Also, gcc now
	looks in $(tooldir) by default.
	configure.in: if cross-compiling, override $(INSTALLDIR) to
	$(tooldir)/lib.

Fri Sep 11 16:05:08 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: When cross-compiling, don't build
	gperf, or the utils directory, or test-install.

Thu Sep 10 22:49:34 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* utils/gen-params: test for existence of curses.h.  It's not in
	newlib.  Also corrected a couple of typos.

Wed Sep  9 12:34:00 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: try to get correct version of nm for target for
	gen-params.

Mon Aug 31 16:14:34 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Bump to version 2.2.3.
	* Makefile.in:  Convert ${readme} to be `pwd`/ (with a
	trailing slash) (as done in iostream).

Mon Aug 17 17:15:06 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* utils/gen-params:  Allow command-line (e.g. HAVE_UNISTD=0)
	to override feature testing for various include files.
	* Makefile.in:   Pass $(NOSTDINC) to gen-params.
	Turn off execute permission after installing data. 

Wed Aug 12 00:33:09 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* utils/c++-mode.el:  New version.

	* Makefile.in: Change to version 2.2.1.
	* Makefile.in:  Remove some old junk.
	Let 'install' depend on 'all'.
	Let 'install' also install gperf.
	* utils/gen-params:  Test for Posix-compatible (or rather
	iostream/procbuf.C-compatible) sys/wait.h by compiling
	C++ test program, not C.  Fixes NeXT problem, I hope.
	Also, fix typo when predefined DOLLAR_IN_LABEL (fixes hpux).

Mon Aug 10 11:38:14 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@dumbest.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: always create installation directories.

Fri Jun 26 12:26:35 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: Change to version 2.2.
	* Makefile.in:  Don't `cd ../libiberty; make'; since this
	may cause some confusion (with old versions of GNU make
	passing the wrong environment); instead assume that
	../Makefile takes care of it.
	* configure.in, config/hpux.mh:  hpux support.
	* utils/etags.c:  stat fixes for Posix and SVR3.
	* utils/gen-params:  Minor fixes.

Mon Jun 22 23:54:31 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Increase to version 2.1.92.
	* utils/gen-params.  Add some paranoia when trying to
	figure out a type for _G_ssize_t - make sure it doesn't
	conflict with read().

Fri Jun 19 23:15:13 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Increase to version 2.1.91.
	* utils/etags.c:  New version, from emacs-19.
	* utils/Makefile.in:  New etags needs GNU getopt.
	* utils/gen-params:  Take out _G_HAVE_UNION_WAIT testing.
	Instead, check that wait() will accept an (int*) - as
	Posix and tradition (but not NeXT) says it should -
	if it doesn't, say that we don't HAVE_SYS_WAIT.

Wed Jun 17 18:48:16 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Increase version number to 2.1.90.
	* no-stream/Makefile.in:  New directory and file.
	Useful for building libg++ *without* iostreams.
	* Makefile.in, */Makefile.in:  Cleanup *clean rules,
	following standards.texi.
	* utils/gendepend:  Remove tempoary file depend.tmp.
	* utils/gen-params:  Check if <sys/wait.h> defines union wait.
	* WHATS.NEW:  Merge old stuff from (deleted) etc/release.log.
	* configure.in:  Check that we find an install that works;
	for SYSV, also try /usr/ucb/install.
	* TODO, README, libg++.texinfo:  Minor changes.

Wed Jun  3 23:10:20 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Set version number to 2.1.
	* utils/gen-params:  If ${NAMES_HAVE_UNDERSCORE} is non-null,
	use that value; don't bother trying to deduce it.
	Ditto for ${DOLLAR_IN_LABEL}.
	Replace sed-idiom -n -e 1,1p by -e '2,$d', because the
	former doesn't work in GNU sed.
	Add sigset_t to the list of types searched for.
	Look for <sys/wait.h> and defined _G_HAVE_SYS_WAIT appropriately.
	* vms/{_G_config.h,AAAREADME.TXT}:  New versions from Youngdale.
	* libg++.texinfo:  Note failure behavior for String::before().
	* Makefile.in:  Use FLAGS_TO_PASS variable to be more
	consistent about flags to pass to sub-makes.
	Add some hooks for people with unusual environments:
	Unually powerful C-libraries, or they don't want iostreams
	to be part of libg++.a.
	* configure.in:  Test for Linux configuration.
	Avoid confusing error message when looking for ranlib.

Fri May 29 13:08:12 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* utils/gen-params:  Remove TMP before running a sed which
	writes to it (GNU sed supposedly has a bug where in that it
	doesn't truncate a file before writing to it).
	* Makefile.in:  Include strerror.o strsignal.o (from libiberty).

	* Makefile.in:  Bump to version 2.0.91.
	* etags.c:  #undef TRUE and FALSE before defining, to
	avoid collisions.  (These inevitable collisions make it
	a mistake to define TRUE and FALSE in the first place.)
	* gen-params:  Test for <dirent.h>.
	Use ${SED} instead of sed, since GNU sed may be broken.
	Check if the type we found for va_list works, and have
	a fall-back plan for when it doesn't.
	* gen-params:  Check for sprintf return type.
	Don't emit unneeded _G_const.
	* config/mt-*:  Remove unused and obsolete files.
	* vms directory:  Updates from Eric Youngdale.
	* README:  Minor fixes.

Thu May 14 12:29:29 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Set version to 2.0.90.
	* Makefile.in:  Pass new flags to test-install, now that
	test-install has been changed to to use ../libg++.a etc;
	override that to use -lg++ etc to get inststalled versions.
	* COPYING:  Replace by version 2 GPL.
	* README:  Explain what copyrights apply to what.
	* libg++.texinfo:  Remove comments about gperf, since it
	is not part of libg++ proper (and is GPL, not LGPL).

	* util/gen-params:  Re-order in a logical order.
	Change _G_NO_UNISTD_H to _G_HAVE_UNISTD for consistency.
	Add test for _G_FRIEND_BUG (if the compiler barfs on
	extern "C" functions as friends).

Wed May 13 12:06:57 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in:  Make sure to append 'depend' (if it exists)
	to each Makefile.

Sat May  9 12:43:38 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Bump version to 2.0.9.

	* WHATS.NEW:  Be more expansive.
	* configure.in:  Fix some typos.
	* Various Makefile.in's:  Pass $(NOSTDINC) when compiling.
	Also, fix some other CFLAGS problems.

Wed May  6 11:48:32 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* utils/gen-params:  Also #include <time.h> in dummy.c,
	so we can get clock_t.

	* utils/gen-params: Moved argument evaluation to start.
	Pass -I${gccdir}/include if using ${gccdir}/gcc.
	* Makefile.in:  Pass $(XTRAFLAGS) to gen-params.
	* vms directory:  Renamed _G_CONFIG.H to _G_config.h.

Sat May  2 16:48:07 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* vms directory:  New files from Eric Youngdale.

Thu Apr 30 13:42:59 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Bump to version 2.0.8 for "progressive" release.
	* every Makefile.in:  Replace gcc -O by just gcc, for constiency.
	* utils/gen-params:  Rename every temp.c -> dummy.c.
	Add test for sys/resource.h, and use that instead of the
	no-longer-meaning test for sysv.
	* Makefile.in:  Install sys/*.h from g++-include, not src.
	Fix so that 'make libg++.a' does the right thing.

Mon Apr 20 14:59:59 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* utils/gen-params:  Add introductory commentary.
	Replace tabs by space in dummy.out, so following
	sed scripts don't have to worry about tabs.

Thu Apr 30 09:06:32 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: add .NOEXPORT so that subdirs don't inherit
	  bad definitions.  Notably, so that libiberty doesn't inherit
	  host_makefile_frag.

Fri Apr 17 13:50:41 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* configure.in:  Use new 'subdirs' feature of configure,
	to configure all sub-directories in one invocation of
	'configure'.  This means we can get rid of all subdir
	configure.in files, and we can share configuration files.
	* configure.in:  If there is no host makefile fragment.
	generate one.
	* Makefile.in, */Makefile.in, etc: Use new configure scheme.
	Also, define CC using a test for ../gcc/gcc, not just
	a ../gcc directory.  Similar for AR etc.
	* utils/gen-params:  New shell script to generate a .h
	file with various system-specific parameters.
	* Makefile.in:  New rule to generate _G_config.h using
	utils/gen-params.  All Makefiles include the top-level
	directory in the include search path, to make sure they
	get _G_config.h (which is the the libg++ build directory,
	not the srcdir).

Mon Mar 23 16:46:01 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* libg++.texinfo:  Remove references to itoa and similar
	deprecated functions that return a pseudo-static buffer
	(allocated by AllocRings).   Replace by reference
	to (new) printon() methods.

Tue Mar 10 18:06:49 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Bump to version 2.0.
	* Makefile.in (dist):  Fix to avoid symlink cycles.

Sat Mar  7 19:36:35 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* PROBLEMS renamed to TODO.

Thu Mar  5 00:18:15 1992  Heinrich G. Seidl  (hgs@cygnus.com)

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: use `g++' as compiler for the library
	  as does the user.

	* Make.defs: use again awk for depend rules, since sed
	  has too many bugs (sun's and GNU).
          utils/g++dep.sh: print each dependency on one line

Wed Mar  4 12:04:45 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Don't pass $(MAKE_ENVIRON) to test-install,
	since we're trying to test the *installed* compiler.
	Also, install-progs before the test-install.

Tue Mar  3 23:01:05 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* PROBLEMS:  Added to list of things to do.

Tue Mar  3 21:06:38 1992  Heinrich G. Seidl  (hgs@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Created `utils' directory and moved "progs" from
	  `etc' into `utils'. 
	  Makefile.in: `all' builds only programs and the libary,
		       `check' builds all in `tests' and `etc' and 
		       runs the tests.
          Some minor bug fixes to Makefiles.

Tue Mar  3 16:58:38 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* vms directory:  New files from
	Eric Youngdale <youngdale@v6550c.nrl.navy.mil>.

Sun Mar  1 17:17:54 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Added 'check' and 'etc-tests' rules.

Thu Feb 27 17:05:49 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* Make.defs:  Change GXX from g++ to gcc, since g++
	passes -lg++ to ld, which may not be installed yet.

Wed Feb 26 18:04:40 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: removed traces of namesubdir,
	  -subdirs, $(subdir), $(unsubdir), some rcs triggers.  Forced
	  copyrights to '92, changed some from Cygnus to FSF.

Wed Feb 26 12:46:49 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Make.defs:  Change IDIR to use libdir instead of
	datadir, to be compatible with FSF's gcc-2.0.
	* Makefile.in:  Removed bogus '@' prefix in rule.

Wed Feb 26 01:24:34 1992  Michael Tiemann  (tiemann at cygnus.com)

	* Make.defs: Propagate XTRAFLAGS into MAKE_ENVIRON.

Wed Feb 19 23:23:02 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Make.defs:  Add IO_SRCDIR macro to name source
	of either isotream or old-stream.  This allows
	an independent iostream distribution.
	* Make.defs (depend rule):  Create empty file if no sources.
	* README:  Move change summary to WHATS.NEW.
	* WHATS.NEWS:  Minor updates (and merge).
	* COPYING-LIB:  New file defining Library Licence.

Sat Feb 15 13:06:50 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (dist):  Add some more top-level (above
	libg++) files to the distribution.

	* Makefile.in:  Bumped LIBG++_DIST_VERSION to 1.91.

	using an AllocRing.)

Fri Feb  7 11:46:18 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: Added LIBG++_DIST_VERSION; set it to 1.90.
	Added 'dist' rule to make distribution tar file.

	new iostream facilities.

Fri Jan 31 17:13:11 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* WHATS.NEW:  New file, to document recent changes.

Wed Jan 29 12:54:10 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Make.defs:  Change LIBDIR and IDIR so that libg++.a and
	g++-include/* go info $(libdir) and $(datadir)/g++-include.
	Thus we don't have to worry about gcc's $(libsubdir)
	depending on gcc's version number.
	Also, add compilation rules for *.C.

Sat Jan 25 15:59:01 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at PersSony)

	* Make.defs, all Makefile.in files:  Centralize rules for
	depend, FORCE, and Makefile in MAke.defs.  Remove such
	rules from every Makeifle.in.
	* Makefile.in: Don't pass GXXFLAGS or EH_FILES to sub-makes.

Fri Jan 17 15:32:01 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	iostream library.  Allow use from any sub-directory.
	* configure.in:  Add old-stream and gperf sub-directories.

Fri Jan  3 16:36:31 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Complex.h, Fix.h, String.h, gen/DLList.ccP, gen/SLList.ccP,
	gen/Plex.ccP, gen/Vec.hP:  Add #include <builtin.h> as needed.
	It was included by the old stream.h, but not by the new iostream.h.
	* String.h:  Fix some portabilty problems that depended
	on the old stream code.

Thu Jan  2 21:07:04 1992  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (info, install-info, clean-info):  Handle info files.

          classes in constructors

Sat Oct  6 08:56:56 1990  Doug Lea  (dl at g.oswego.edu)

        * RNG.cc: `volatile' added for vars that might have

        * Makefiles: rearrangements, patches from Ron Guillmette
        to enable compiles of etc and gperf files without install

        * Added swap.h, from Ron Guilmette. Apparently needed for
        Hansen's C++ answer book code.
