	Merge in Doug Lea's latest version; other fixes.
	* Most files:  Replaced copyright notice (the old
	ones claimed to be part of GNU CC).
	* Most files: Remove #pragma once (useless for gcc-2).
	* File.h, istream.cc, ostream.h:  Minor fixes.

	* istream.h, istream.cc:  Add ws in addistion to WS,
	to allow src files to use the newer (iostream) name.
	* itoa.cc:  Moved definitions of hex() etc to here
	from builtin.h.
	* Makefile.in:  Remove subdir-related junk.
