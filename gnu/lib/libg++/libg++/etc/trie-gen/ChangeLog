Wed Apr 26 17:08:49 1995  Brendan Kehoe  (brendan@lisa.cygnus.com)

	* options.cc (report_error): Wrap the init of `callback' with braces.

Fri May 13 19:07:25 1994  Jason Merrill  (jason@deneb.cygnus.com)

	* trie.cc (Trie::sort): add `const' as needed to make conformant.

Sun Feb  6 22:22:09 1994  Jason Merrill  (jason@deneb.cygnus.com)

	* compact.cc: Include renew.h
	* trie.cc: Ditto.

	* renew.h (new): Define reallocish new.

Mon Oct 25 18:51:56 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@kalessin.cygnus.com)

	* main.cc: Don't bother increasing the stack size.

Tue Sep 28 15:54:48 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@kalessin.cygnus.com)

	* main.cc:  #include <sys/time.h> before <sys/resource.h>.
	(Problem reported by Jeffrey A Law <law@shafer.cs.utah.edu>.)

Fri Jun  4 18:42:24 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* compact.cc, trie.cc:  If 'char' is unsigned, write
	explicit 'signed char' for tables of signed chars.

Sun Apr 25 20:04:18 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	Changes (mostly from Peter Schauer) to permit compilation
	using cfront 3.0 and otherwise be ARM-conforming.
	* compact.cc (operator new):  Don't depend on gcc-specific
	pointer arithmetic on (void*).
	* compact.{h,cc}, trie.{h,cc}:  Replace MAX_UNSIGNED_CHAR,
	MAX_UNSIGNED_SHORT, MAX_SIGNED_CHAR, and MAX_SIGNED_SHORT
	by CHAR_MAX, USHRT_MAX,  SCHAR_MAX, and SHRT_MAX from <limits.h>.
	* compact.cc, trie.cc:  Removed _G_OLD_PLACEMENT (old-style
	'new' placement syntax) support.
	* compact.cc:  Remove dependency on gcc-specific >? (max)
	operator.
	* trie.h (Trie::MAX_ASCII):  Replaced by global in trie.cc.
	* compact.h, compat.cc:  Ditto for MAX_ASCII_RANGE.
	* compact.h: Removed MAX_INT.
	* trie.h (Trie::Trie):  Gave default value for parameter,
	allowing us to get rid of the const field DEFAULT_SIZE.
	* main.cc (main):  Renamed variable Trie to trie.
	* test.cc:  Add #include <string.h> (for strlen).

Wed Dec 30 16:48:08 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Don't pass -1 flag to 'ls' (unless LS_1
	is overridden), as some versions of ls don't support it,
	and those that do don't seem to need it.
	* main.cc:  Use _G_HAVE_SYS_RESOURCE before including
	<sys/resource.h> and doing the rlimit stuff.

Mon Dec 21 18:12:31 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* compact.cc: Fix to avoid evaluation order dependencies.

Mon Nov 30 16:51:33 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* trie.h (class Trie), compact.h (class Compact_Matrix,
	class Compact_Matrix::Row_Node), compact.cc (new method
	Compact_Matrix::init):  Don't use no-longer-allowed
	initialized non-const fields; use constructors instead.

Tue Nov 17 22:00:15 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* compact.cc:  ANSIfy:  bcopy->memcpy, bzero->memset,
	* compact.cc (Compact_Matrix::first_fit_decreasing):  Re-write
	dubious memory allocation using alloca to use
	malloc/realloc/free.  This supposedly fixes an HPUX problem.
	* trie.cc (Trie::output):  Fix to avoid const/non-const
	warning when compiling generated output.

Sun Nov  1 15:58:19 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* trie.cc, compact.cc:   Use "new" placement syntax
	(as in 'new (ARGS) TYPE'), unless  _G_OLD_PLACEMENT.
	* compact.cc:  ANSI-fy:  bcopy->memcpy etc.
	* Makefile.in:  Minor fixes related to using $(C++).

Sat Mar  7 08:48:53 1992  Michael Tiemann  (tiemann@cygnus.com)

	* options.c: Several methods of the class `Options' remained from
	an earlier implementation.  They have now been removed.

Sun Mar  1 17:03:43 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* trie.h (Trie::Trie):  Initialize current_size field.
	* Makefile.in:  Add 'check' rule.

Wed Feb 26 18:04:40 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: removed traces of namesubdir,
	  -subdirs, $(subdir), $(unsubdir), some rcs triggers.  Forced
	  copyrights to '92, changed some from Cygnus to FSF.

Sat Feb  1 13:40:04 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Rename test.c to test.cc (avoids some problems in
	getting the wrong include files).

Fri Feb 23 19:44:10 1990  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at zola.ics.uci.edu)

        * Added the `-h' option to print out a verbose help message.

        * Added a check in Trie::output that ensures the program doesn't
          crash if no keywords are given!
          
        * Implemented the -f (generate full trie) option.  This is useful
          to generate another example program for my USENIX C++ paper!

        * Removed the member field `compact_output' from class Trie.  
          Changed all uses of this variable to option[COMPACT].  Why
          was it ever done the other way anyhow?!

        * Added the `-C' CONST option so that user's can declare strings in 
          the generated lookup table to be readonly.

Fri Feb 16 10:47:02 1990  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at zola.ics.uci.edu)

        * Killed some debugging code in compact.cc (operator new).

Thu Feb 15 23:20:44 1990  Doug Schmidt  (schmidt at zola.ics.uci.edu)

        * Fixed a bunch of incredibly stupid errors.  (I can't believe
          this thing even worked before...).  That's what happens when you
          don't hack for 2 months ;-(
