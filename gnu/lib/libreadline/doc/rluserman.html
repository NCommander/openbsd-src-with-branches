<H1><A NAME="SEC1" HREF="rluserman.html#TOC1">Command Line Editing</A></H1>

<P>
This chapter describes the basic features of the GNU
command line editing interface.

</P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="rluserman.html#SEC2">Introduction and Notation</A>: Notation used in this text.
<LI><A HREF="rluserman.html#SEC3">Readline Interaction</A>: The minimum set of commands for editing a line.

</UL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="rluserman.html#TOC2">Introduction to Line Editing</A></H2>

<P>
The following paragraphs describe the notation used to represent
keystrokes.

</P>
<P>
The text <KBD>C-k</KBD> is read as `Control-K' and describes the character
produced when the <KBD>k</KBD> key is pressed while the Control key
is depressed.

</P>
<P>
The text <KBD>M-k</KBD> is read as `Meta-K' and describes the character
produced when the Meta key (if you have one) is depressed, and the <KBD>k</KBD>
key is pressed.
The Meta key is labeled <KBD>ALT</KBD> on many keyboards.
On keyboards with two keys labeled <KBD>ALT</KBD> (usually to either side of
the space bar), the <KBD>ALT</KBD> on the left side is generally set to
work as a Meta key.
The <KBD>ALT</KBD> key on the right may also be configured to work as a
Meta key or may be configured as some other modifier, such as a
Compose key for typing accented characters.

</P>
<P>
If you do not have a Meta or <KBD>ALT</KBD> key, or another key working as
a Meta key, the identical keystroke can be generated by typing <KBD>ESC</KBD>
<I>first</I>, and then typing <KBD>k</KBD>.
Either process is known as <EM>metafying</EM> the <KBD>k</KBD> key.

</P>
<P>
The text <KBD>M-C-k</KBD> is read as `Meta-Control-k' and describes the
character produced by <EM>metafying</EM> <KBD>C-k</KBD>.

</P>
<P>
In addition, several keys have their own names.  Specifically,
<KBD>DEL</KBD>, <KBD>ESC</KBD>, <KBD>LFD</KBD>, <KBD>SPC</KBD>, <KBD>RET</KBD>, and <KBD>TAB</KBD> all
stand for themselves when seen in this text, or in an init file
(see section <A HREF="rluserman.html#SEC9">Readline Init File</A>).
If your keyboard lacks a <KBD>LFD</KBD> key, typing <KBD>C-j</KBD> will
produce the desired character.
The <KBD>RET</KBD> key may be labeled <KBD>Return</KBD> or <KBD>Enter</KBD> on
some keyboards.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="rluserman.html#TOC3">Readline Interaction</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1"></A>

</P>
<P>
Often during an interactive session you type in a long line of text,
only to notice that the first word on the line is misspelled.  The
Readline library gives you a set of commands for manipulating the text
as you type it in, allowing you to just fix your typo, and not forcing
you to retype the majority of the line.  Using these editing commands,
you move the cursor to the place that needs correction, and delete or
insert the text of the corrections.  Then, when you are satisfied with
the line, you simply press <KBD>RETURN</KBD>.  You do not have to be at the
end of the line to press <KBD>RETURN</KBD>; the entire line is accepted
regardless of the location of the cursor within the line.

<A NAME="IDX3"></A>
<A NAME="IDX4"></A>

</P>
<P>
In order to enter characters into the line, simply type them.  The typed
character appears where the cursor was, and then the cursor moves one
space to the right.  If you mistype a character, you can use your
erase character to back up and delete the mistyped character.

</P>
<P>
Sometimes you may mistype a character, and
not notice the error until you have typed several other characters.  In
that case, you can type <KBD>C-b</KBD> to move the cursor to the left, and then
correct your mistake.  Afterwards, you can move the cursor to the right
with <KBD>C-f</KBD>.

</P>
<P>
When you add text in the middle of a line, you will notice that characters
to the right of the cursor are `pushed over' to make room for the text
that you have inserted.  Likewise, when you delete text behind the cursor,
characters to the right of the cursor are `pulled back' to fill in the
blank space created by the removal of the text.  A list of the bare
essentials for editing the text of an input line follows.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>C-b</KBD>
<DD>
Move back one character.
<DT><KBD>C-f</KBD>
<DD>
Move forward one character.
<DT><KBD>DEL</KBD> or <KBD>Backspace</KBD>
<DD>
Delete the character to the left of the cursor.
<DT><KBD>C-d</KBD>
<DD>
Delete the character underneath the cursor.
<DT>Printing characters
<DD>
Insert the character into the line at the cursor.
<DT><KBD>C-_</KBD> or <KBD>C-x C-u</KBD>
<DD>
Undo the last editing command.  You can undo all the way back to an
empty line.
</DL>

<P>
(Depending on your configuration, the <KBD>Backspace</KBD> key be set to
delete the character to the left of the cursor and the <KBD>DEL</KBD> key set
to delete the character underneath the cursor, like <KBD>C-d</KBD>, rather
than the character to the left of the cursor.)

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="rluserman.html#TOC5">Readline Movement Commands</A></H3>

<P>
The above table describes the most basic keystrokes that you need
in order to do editing of the input line.  For your convenience, many
other commands have been added in addition to <KBD>C-b</KBD>, <KBD>C-f</KBD>,
<KBD>C-d</KBD>, and <KBD>DEL</KBD>.  Here are some commands for moving more rapidly
about the line.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>C-a</KBD>
<DD>
Move to the start of the line.
<DT><KBD>C-e</KBD>
<DD>
Move to the end of the line.
<DT><KBD>M-f</KBD>
<DD>
Move forward a word, where a word is composed of letters and digits.
<DT><KBD>M-b</KBD>
<DD>
Move backward a word.
<DT><KBD>C-l</KBD>
<DD>
Clear the screen, reprinting the current line at the top.
</DL>

<P>
Notice how <KBD>C-f</KBD> moves forward a character, while <KBD>M-f</KBD> moves
forward a word.  It is a loose convention that control keystrokes
operate on characters while meta keystrokes operate on words.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="rluserman.html#TOC6">Readline Killing Commands</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6"></A>

</P>
<P>
<EM>Killing</EM> text means to delete the text from the line, but to save
it away for later use, usually by <EM>yanking</EM> (re-inserting)
it back into the line.
(`Cut' and `paste' are more recent jargon for `kill' and `yank'.)

</P>
<P>
If the description for a command says that it `kills' text, then you can
be sure that you can get the text back in a different (or the same)
place later.

</P>
<P>
When you use a kill command, the text is saved in a <EM>kill-ring</EM>.
Any number of consecutive kills save all of the killed text together, so
that when you yank it back, you get it all.  The kill
ring is not line specific; the text that you killed on a previously
typed line is available to be yanked back later, when you are typing
another line.
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>

</P>
<P>
Here is the list of commands for killing text.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>C-k</KBD>
<DD>
Kill the text from the current cursor position to the end of the line.

<DT><KBD>M-d</KBD>
<DD>
Kill from the cursor to the end of the current word, or, if between
words, to the end of the next word.
Word boundaries are the same as those used by <KBD>M-f</KBD>.

<DT><KBD>M-DEL</KBD>
<DD>
Kill from the cursor the start of the previous word, or, if between
words, to the start of the previous word.
Word boundaries are the same as those used by <KBD>M-b</KBD>.

<DT><KBD>C-w</KBD>
<DD>
Kill from the cursor to the previous whitespace.  This is different than
<KBD>M-DEL</KBD> because the word boundaries differ.

</DL>

<P>
Here is how to <EM>yank</EM> the text back into the line.  Yanking
means to copy the most-recently-killed text from the kill buffer.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>C-y</KBD>
<DD>
Yank the most recently killed text back into the buffer at the cursor.

<DT><KBD>M-y</KBD>
<DD>
Rotate the kill-ring, and yank the new top.  You can only do this if
the prior command is <KBD>C-y</KBD> or <KBD>M-y</KBD>.
</DL>



<H3><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="rluserman.html#TOC7">Readline Arguments</A></H3>

<P>
You can pass numeric arguments to Readline commands.  Sometimes the
argument acts as a repeat count, other times it is the <I>sign</I> of the
argument that is significant.  If you pass a negative argument to a
command which normally acts in a forward direction, that command will
act in a backward direction.  For example, to kill text back to the
start of the line, you might type <SAMP>`M-- C-k'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
The general way to pass numeric arguments to a command is to type meta
digits before the command.  If the first `digit' typed is a minus
sign (<SAMP>`-'</SAMP>), then the sign of the argument will be negative.  Once
you have typed one meta digit to get the argument started, you can type
the remainder of the digits, and then the command.  For example, to give
the <KBD>C-d</KBD> command an argument of 10, you could type <SAMP>`M-1 0 C-d'</SAMP>.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="rluserman.html#TOC8">Searching for Commands in the History</A></H3>

<P>
Readline provides commands for searching through the command history
for lines containing a specified string.
There are two search modes:  <VAR>incremental</VAR> and <VAR>non-incremental</VAR>.

</P>
<P>
Incremental searches begin before the user has finished typing the
search string.
As each character of the search string is typed, Readline displays
the next entry from the history matching the string typed so far.
An incremental search requires only as many characters as needed to
find the desired history entry.
To search backward in the history for a particular string, type
<KBD>C-r</KBD>.  Typing <KBD>C-s</KBD> searches forward through the history.
The characters present in the value of the <CODE>isearch-terminators</CODE> variable
are used to terminate an incremental search.
If that variable has not been assigned a value, the <KBD>ESC</KBD> and
<KBD>C-J</KBD> characters will terminate an incremental search.
<KBD>C-g</KBD> will abort an incremental search and restore the original line.
When the search is terminated, the history entry containing the
search string becomes the current line.

</P>
<P>
To find other matching entries in the history list, type <KBD>C-r</KBD> or
<KBD>C-s</KBD> as appropriate.
This will search backward or forward in the history for the next
entry matching the search string typed so far.
Any other key sequence bound to a Readline command will terminate
the search and execute that command.
For instance, a <KBD>RET</KBD> will terminate the search and accept
the line, thereby executing the command from the history list.

</P>
<P>
Non-incremental searches read the entire search string before starting
to search for matching history lines.  The search string may be
typed by the user or be part of the contents of the current line.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="rluserman.html#TOC9">Readline Init File</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>

</P>
<P>
Although the Readline library comes with a set of Emacs-like
keybindings installed by default, it is possible to use a different set
of keybindings.
Any user can customize programs that use Readline by putting
commands in an <EM>inputrc</EM> file, conventionally in his home directory.
The name of this
file is taken from the value of the environment variable <CODE>INPUTRC</CODE>.  If
that variable is unset, the default is <TT>`~/.inputrc'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
When a program which uses the Readline library starts up, the
init file is read, and the key bindings are set.

</P>
<P>
In addition, the <CODE>C-x C-r</CODE> command re-reads this init file, thus
incorporating any changes that you might have made to it.

</P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="rluserman.html#SEC10">Readline Init File Syntax</A>: Syntax for the commands in the inputrc file.

<LI><A HREF="rluserman.html#SEC11">Conditional Init Constructs</A>: Conditional key bindings in the inputrc file.

<LI><A HREF="rluserman.html#SEC12">Sample Init File</A>: An example inputrc file.
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="rluserman.html#TOC10">Readline Init File Syntax</A></H3>

<P>
There are only a few basic constructs allowed in the
Readline init file.  Blank lines are ignored.
Lines beginning with a <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> are comments.
Lines beginning with a <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> indicate conditional
constructs (see section <A HREF="rluserman.html#SEC11">Conditional Init Constructs</A>).  Other lines
denote variable settings and key bindings.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>Variable Settings
<DD>
You can modify the run-time behavior of Readline by
altering the values of variables in Readline
using the <CODE>set</CODE> command within the init file.  Here is how to
change from the default Emacs-like key binding to use
<CODE>vi</CODE> line editing commands:


<PRE>
set editing-mode vi
</PRE>

A great deal of run-time behavior is changeable with the following
variables.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>bell-style</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
Controls what happens when Readline wants to ring the terminal bell.
If set to <SAMP>`none'</SAMP>, Readline never rings the bell.  If set to
<SAMP>`visible'</SAMP>, Readline uses a visible bell if one is available.
If set to <SAMP>`audible'</SAMP> (the default), Readline attempts to ring
the terminal's bell.

<DT><CODE>comment-begin</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
The string to insert at the beginning of the line when the
<CODE>insert-comment</CODE> command is executed.  The default value
is <CODE>"#"</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>completion-ignore-case</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>, Readline performs filename matching and completion
in a case-insensitive fashion.
The default value is <SAMP>`off'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>completion-query-items</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
The number of possible completions that determines when the user is
asked whether he wants to see the list of possibilities.  If the
number of possible completions is greater than this value,
Readline will ask the user whether or not he wishes to view
them; otherwise, they are simply listed.  The default limit is
<CODE>100</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>convert-meta</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
If set to <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>, Readline will convert characters with the
eighth bit set to an ASCII key sequence by stripping the eighth
bit and prefixing an <KBD>ESC</KBD> character, converting them to a
meta-prefixed key sequence.  The default value is <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>disable-completion</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
If set to <SAMP>`On'</SAMP>, Readline will inhibit word completion.
Completion  characters will be inserted into the line as if they had
been mapped to <CODE>self-insert</CODE>.  The default is <SAMP>`off'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>editing-mode</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
The <CODE>editing-mode</CODE> variable controls which default set of
key bindings is used.  By default, Readline starts up in Emacs editing
mode, where the keystrokes are most similar to Emacs.  This variable can be
set to either <SAMP>`emacs'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`vi'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>enable-keypad</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
When set to <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>, Readline will try to enable the application
keypad when it is called.  Some systems need this to enable the
arrow keys.  The default is <SAMP>`off'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>expand-tilde</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
If set to <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>, tilde expansion is performed when Readline
attempts word completion.  The default is <SAMP>`off'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>horizontal-scroll-mode</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
This variable can be set to either <SAMP>`on'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`off'</SAMP>.  Setting it
to <SAMP>`on'</SAMP> means that the text of the lines being edited will scroll
horizontally on a single screen line when they are longer than the width
of the screen, instead of wrapping onto a new screen line.  By default,
this variable is set to <SAMP>`off'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>input-meta</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX18"></A>
<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
If set to <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>, Readline will enable eight-bit input (it
will not strip the eighth bit from the characters it reads),
regardless of what the terminal claims it can support.  The
default value is <SAMP>`off'</SAMP>.  The name <CODE>meta-flag</CODE> is a
synonym for this variable.

<DT><CODE>isearch-terminators</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX20"></A>
The string of characters that should terminate an incremental search without
subsequently executing the character as a command (see section <A HREF="rluserman.html#SEC8">Searching for Commands in the History</A>).
If this variable has not been given a value, the characters <KBD>ESC</KBD> and
<KBD>C-J</KBD> will terminate an incremental search.

<DT><CODE>keymap</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX21"></A>
Sets Readline's idea of the current keymap for key binding commands.
Acceptable <CODE>keymap</CODE> names are
<CODE>emacs</CODE>,
<CODE>emacs-standard</CODE>,
<CODE>emacs-meta</CODE>,
<CODE>emacs-ctlx</CODE>,
<CODE>vi</CODE>,
<CODE>vi-command</CODE>, and
<CODE>vi-insert</CODE>.
<CODE>vi</CODE> is equivalent to <CODE>vi-command</CODE>; <CODE>emacs</CODE> is
equivalent to <CODE>emacs-standard</CODE>.  The default value is <CODE>emacs</CODE>.
The value of the <CODE>editing-mode</CODE> variable also affects the
default keymap.

<DT><CODE>mark-directories</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>, completed directory names have a slash
appended.  The default is <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>mark-modified-lines</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX22"></A>
This variable, when set to <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>, causes Readline to display an
asterisk (<SAMP>`*'</SAMP>) at the start of history lines which have been modified.
This variable is <SAMP>`off'</SAMP> by default.

<DT><CODE>output-meta</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX23"></A>
If set to <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>, Readline will display characters with the
eighth bit set directly rather than as a meta-prefixed escape
sequence.  The default is <SAMP>`off'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>print-completions-horizontally</CODE>
<DD>
If set to <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>, Readline will display completions with matches
sorted horizontally in alphabetical order, rather than down the screen.
The default is <SAMP>`off'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>show-all-if-ambiguous</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>
This alters the default behavior of the completion functions.  If
set to <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>, 
words which have more than one possible completion cause the
matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell.
The default value is <SAMP>`off'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>visible-stats</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX25"></A>
If set to <SAMP>`on'</SAMP>, a character denoting a file's type
is appended to the filename when listing possible
completions.  The default is <SAMP>`off'</SAMP>.

</DL>

<DT>Key Bindings
<DD>
The syntax for controlling key bindings in the init file is
simple.  First you need to find the name of the command that you
want to change.  The following sections contain tables of the command
name, the default keybinding, if any, and a short description of what
the command does.

Once you know the name of the command, simply place the name of the key
you wish to bind the command to, a colon, and then the name of the
command on a line in the init file.  The name of the key
can be expressed in different ways, depending on which is most
comfortable for you.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><VAR>keyname</VAR>: <VAR>function-name</VAR> or <VAR>macro</VAR>
<DD>
<VAR>keyname</VAR> is the name of a key spelled out in English.  For example:

<PRE>
Control-u: universal-argument
Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word
Control-o: "&#62; output"
</PRE>

In the above example, <KBD>C-u</KBD> is bound to the function
<CODE>universal-argument</CODE>, and <KBD>C-o</KBD> is bound to run the macro
expressed on the right hand side (that is, to insert the text
<SAMP>`&#62; output'</SAMP> into the line).

<DT>"<VAR>keyseq</VAR>": <VAR>function-name</VAR> or <VAR>macro</VAR>
<DD>
<VAR>keyseq</VAR> differs from <VAR>keyname</VAR> above in that strings
denoting an entire key sequence can be specified, by placing
the key sequence in double quotes.  Some GNU Emacs style key
escapes can be used, as in the following example, but the
special character names are not recognized.


<PRE>
"\C-u": universal-argument
"\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file
"\e[11~": "Function Key 1"
</PRE>

In the above example, <KBD>C-u</KBD> is bound to the function
<CODE>universal-argument</CODE> (just as it was in the first example),
<SAMP>`<KBD>C-x</KBD> <KBD>C-r</KBD>'</SAMP> is bound to the function <CODE>re-read-init-file</CODE>,
and <SAMP>`<KBD>ESC</KBD> <KBD>[</KBD> <KBD>1</KBD> <KBD>1</KBD> <KBD>~</KBD>'</SAMP> is bound to insert
the text <SAMP>`Function Key 1'</SAMP>.

</DL>

The following GNU Emacs style escape sequences are available when
specifying key sequences:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE><KBD>\C-</KBD></CODE>
<DD>
control prefix
<DT><CODE><KBD>\M-</KBD></CODE>
<DD>
meta prefix
<DT><CODE><KBD>\e</KBD></CODE>
<DD>
an escape character
<DT><CODE><KBD>\\</KBD></CODE>
<DD>
backslash
<DT><CODE><KBD>\"</KBD></CODE>
<DD>
<KBD>"</KBD>, a double quotation mark
<DT><CODE><KBD>\'</KBD></CODE>
<DD>
<KBD>'</KBD>, a single quote or apostrophe
</DL>

In addition to the GNU Emacs style escape sequences, a second
set of backslash escapes is available:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>\a</CODE>
<DD>
alert (bell)
<DT><CODE>\b</CODE>
<DD>
backspace
<DT><CODE>\d</CODE>
<DD>
delete
<DT><CODE>\f</CODE>
<DD>
form feed
<DT><CODE>\n</CODE>
<DD>
newline
<DT><CODE>\r</CODE>
<DD>
carriage return
<DT><CODE>\t</CODE>
<DD>
horizontal tab
<DT><CODE>\v</CODE>
<DD>
vertical tab
<DT><CODE>\<VAR>nnn</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
the character whose <CODE>ASCII</CODE> code is the octal value <VAR>nnn</VAR>
(one to three digits)
<DT><CODE>\x<VAR>nnn</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
the character whose <CODE>ASCII</CODE> code is the hexadecimal value <VAR>nnn</VAR>
(one to three digits)
</DL>

When entering the text of a macro, single or double quotes must
be used to indicate a macro definition.
Unquoted text is assumed to be a function name.
In the macro body, the backslash escapes described above are expanded.
Backslash will quote any other character in the macro text,
including <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`''</SAMP>.
For example, the following binding will make <SAMP>`C-x \'</SAMP>
insert a single <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> into the line:

<PRE>
"\C-x\\": "\\"
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="rluserman.html#TOC11">Conditional Init Constructs</A></H3>

<P>
Readline implements a facility similar in spirit to the conditional
compilation features of the C preprocessor which allows key
bindings and variable settings to be performed as the result
of tests.  There are four parser directives used.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>$if</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>$if</CODE> construct allows bindings to be made based on the
editing mode, the terminal being used, or the application using
Readline.  The text of the test extends to the end of the line;
no characters are required to isolate it.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>mode</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>mode=</CODE> form of the <CODE>$if</CODE> directive is used to test
whether Readline is in <CODE>emacs</CODE> or <CODE>vi</CODE> mode.
This may be used in conjunction
with the <SAMP>`set keymap'</SAMP> command, for instance, to set bindings in
the <CODE>emacs-standard</CODE> and <CODE>emacs-ctlx</CODE> keymaps only if
Readline is starting out in <CODE>emacs</CODE> mode.

<DT><CODE>term</CODE>
<DD>
The <CODE>term=</CODE> form may be used to include terminal-specific
key bindings, perhaps to bind the key sequences output by the
terminal's function keys.  The word on the right side of the
<SAMP>`='</SAMP> is tested against both the full name of the terminal and
the portion of the terminal name before the first <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>.  This
allows <CODE>sun</CODE> to match both <CODE>sun</CODE> and <CODE>sun-cmd</CODE>,
for instance.

<DT><CODE>application</CODE>
<DD>
The <VAR>application</VAR> construct is used to include
application-specific settings.  Each program using the Readline
library sets the <VAR>application name</VAR>, and you can test for it. 
This could be used to bind key sequences to functions useful for
a specific program.  For instance, the following command adds a
key sequence that quotes the current or previous word in Bash:

<PRE>
$if Bash
# Quote the current or previous word
"\C-xq": "\eb\"\ef\""
$endif
</PRE>

</DL>

<DT><CODE>$endif</CODE>
<DD>
This command, as seen in the previous example, terminates an
<CODE>$if</CODE> command.

<DT><CODE>$else</CODE>
<DD>
Commands in this branch of the <CODE>$if</CODE> directive are executed if
the test fails.

<DT><CODE>$include</CODE>
<DD>
This directive takes a single filename as an argument and reads commands
and bindings from that file.

<PRE>
$include /etc/inputrc
</PRE>

</DL>



<H3><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="rluserman.html#TOC12">Sample Init File</A></H3>

<H3><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="rluserman.html#TOC18">Specifying Numeric Arguments</A></H3>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>digit-argument (M-0, M-1, ... M--)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX72"></A>
Add this digit to the argument already accumulating, or start a new
argument.  <KBD>M--</KBD> starts a negative argument.

<DT><CODE>universal-argument ()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX73"></A>
This is another way to specify an argument.
If this command is followed by one or more digits, optionally with a
leading minus sign, those digits define the argument.
If the command is followed by digits, executing <CODE>universal-argument</CODE>
again ends the numeric argument, but is otherwise ignored.
As a special case, if this command is immediately followed by a
character that is neither a digit or minus sign, the argument count
for the next command is multiplied by four.
The argument count is initially one, so executing this function the
first time makes the argument count four, a second time makes the
argument count sixteen, and so on.
By default, this is not bound to a key.
</DL>



<H3><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="rluserman.html#TOC19">Letting Readline Type For You</A></H3>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>complete (TAB)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX74"></A>
Attempt to do completion on the text before the cursor.  This is
application-specific.  Generally, if you are typing a filename
argument, you can do filename completion; if you are typing a command,
you can do command completion; if you are typing in a symbol to GDB, you
can do symbol name completion; if you are typing in a variable to Bash,
you can do variable name completion, and so on.

<DT><CODE>possible-completions (M-?)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX75"></A>
List the possible completions of the text before the cursor.

<DT><CODE>insert-completions (M-*)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX76"></A>
Insert all completions of the text before point that would have
been generated by <CODE>possible-completions</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>menu-complete ()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX77"></A>
Similar to <CODE>complete</CODE>, but replaces the word to be completed
with a single match from the list of possible completions.
Repeated execution of <CODE>menu-complete</CODE> steps through the list
of possible completions, inserting each match in turn.
At the end of the list of completions, the bell is rung and the
original text is restored.
An argument of <VAR>n</VAR> moves <VAR>n</VAR> positions forward in the list
of matches; a negative argument may be used to move backward
through the list.
This command is intended to be bound to <CODE>TAB</CODE>, but is unbound
by default.

<DT><CODE>delete-char-or-list ()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX78"></A>
Deletes the character under the cursor if not at the beginning or
end of the line (like <CODE>delete-char</CODE>).
If at the end of the line, behaves identically to
<CODE>possible-completions</CODE>.
This command is unbound by default.

</DL>

<H2><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="rluserman.html#TOC22">Readline vi Mode</A></H2>

<P>
While the Readline library does not have a full set of <CODE>vi</CODE>
editing functions, it does contain enough to allow simple editing
of the line.  The Readline <CODE>vi</CODE> mode behaves as specified in
the POSIX 1003.2 standard.

</P>
<P>
In order to switch interactively between <CODE>emacs</CODE> and <CODE>vi</CODE>
editing modes, use the command M-C-j (toggle-editing-mode).
The Readline default is <CODE>emacs</CODE> mode.

</P>
<P>
When you enter a line in <CODE>vi</CODE> mode, you are already placed in
`insertion' mode, as if you had typed an <SAMP>`i'</SAMP>.  Pressing <KBD>ESC</KBD>
switches you into `command' mode, where you can edit the text of the
line with the standard <CODE>vi</CODE> movement keys, move to previous
history lines with <SAMP>`k'</SAMP> and subsequent lines with <SAMP>`j'</SAMP>, and
so forth.
