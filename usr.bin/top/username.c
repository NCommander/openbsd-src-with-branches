/*
 *  Username translation code for top.
 *
 *  These routines handle uid to username mapping.
 *  They use a hashing table scheme to reduce reading overhead.
 *  For the time being, these are very straightforward hashing routines.
 *  Maybe someday I'll put in something better.  But with the advent of
 *  "random access" password files, it might not be worth the effort.
 *
 *  Changes to these have been provided by John Gilmore (gnu@toad.com).
 *
 *  The hash has been simplified in this release, to avoid the
 *  table overflow problems of previous releases.  If the value
 *  at the initial hash location is not right, it is replaced
 *  by the right value.  Collisions will cause us to call getpw*
 *  but hey, this is a cache, not the Library of Congress.
 *  This makes the table size independent of the passwd file size.
