.Sh NAME
.Nm sendbug
.Nd report a bug in OpenBSD
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl DEP
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to submit problem reports (PRs) to the
.Ox
bugs database.
A template PR is opened in a text editor
with some system information already filled in,
such as machine architecture,
.Xr dmesg 8 ,
.Xr usbdevs 8 ,
.Xr pcidump 8 ,
and
.Xr acpidump 8 .
The
.Xr pcidump 8
and
.Xr acpidump 8
output are important for ACPI development and can only be included if
.Nm
is run as root.
.Pp
Fields enclosed in
.Sq <>
should be completed by the user.
Once the PR is filled out,
the user exits the editor and is presented with a choice:
a)bort, e)dit, or s)end.
If abort is selected,
the report is not deleted and the pathname of the report is printed.
If edit is selected,
the user is given a chance to re-edit the report.
.Pp
If send is selected,
the report is mailed to the bugs database,
with a Cc to the author.
Any follow up mail to the PR
should keep the same mail subject.
.Pp
The status of bug reports can be followed by checking the
.Mt bugs@openbsd.org
mailing list archive available at
.Lk http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-bugs .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D
Do not attach
.Xr dmesg 8 ,
.Xr usbdevs 8 ,
.Xr pcidump 8 ,
and
.Xr acpidump 8
output to the report.
This information is very helpful in reports,
but may contain sensitive information about the sender.
This flag helps protect users' privacy in those cases.
.It Fl E
The
.Xr acpidump 8
output includes base64 encoded files.
This flag causes
.Nm
to read a PR from the standard input, decode the files,
and write them into the current directory.
.It Fl P
Generate and print the template with system information filled out.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width Ds

nor

are set,
the default is
.Xr vi 1 .
.It Ev PR_FORM
