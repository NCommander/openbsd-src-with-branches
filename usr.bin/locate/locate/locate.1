.Sh NAME
.Nm locate
.Nd find files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ar locate
pattern
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Locate
searches a database for all pathnames which match the specified
.Ar pattern  .
The database is recomputed periodically, and contains the pathnames
of all files which are publicly accessible.
.Pp
Shell globbing and quoting characters (``*'', ``?'', ``\e'', ``[''
and ``]'')
may be used in
.Ar pattern  ,
although they will have to be escaped from the shell.
Preceding any character with a backslash (``\e'') eliminates any special
meaning which it may have.
The matching differs in that no characters must be matched explicitly,
including slashes (``/'').
.Pp
As a special case, a pattern containing no globbing characters (``foo'')
is matched as though it were ``*foo*''.

.Sh BUGS
.Nm Locate
may fail to list some files that are present, or may 
to list files that have been removed from the system.  This is because
locate only reports files that are present in the database, which is
typically only regenerated once a week by the 
.Nm /etc/weekly 
script.  Use
.Xr find 1
to locate files that are of a more transitory nature.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm locate
command appears in
.Bx 4.4 .
