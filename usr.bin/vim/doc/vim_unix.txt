*vim_unix.txt*  For Vim version 4.4.  Last modification: 1996 Apr 23

This file contains the particularities for the Unix version of Vim.

For compiling Vim on Unix see "INSTALL" and "Makefile" in the src directory.

The default help filename is "/usr/local/lib/vim/vim_help.txt"
The files "$HOME/.vimrc" and "$HOME/.exrc" are used instead of "s:.vimrc" and
"s:.exrc". Additionally "/usr/local/etc/vimrc" is used first.
If "/usr/local/share" exists it is used instead of "/usr/local/lib"

Temporary files (for filtering) are put in "/tmp".

With wildcard expansion you can use <~> (home directory) and <$>
(environment variable).

							*fork* *spoon*
For executing external commands fork()/exec() is used when possible, otherwise
system() is used, which is a bit slower.  The output of ":version" includes
"+fork" when fork()/exec() is used.  This can be changed at compile time by
defining USE_SYSTEM in feature.h.  (For forking of the GUI version see
|gui_fork|).

Because terminal updating under Unix is often slow (e.g. serial line
terminal, shell window in suntools), the 'showcommand' and 'ruler' options
are default off. If you have a fast terminal, try setting them on.  You might
also want to set 'ttyfast'.

When using Vim in an xterm the mouse clicks can be used by Vim by setting
'mouse' to "a". If you then still want the xterm copy/paste with the mouse,
press the shift key when using the mouse.  See |mouse_using|.

To use colors in Vim you can use the following example (if your terminal
supports colors!):
	:set t_me=^[[0;1;36m     " normal mode (undoes t_mr and t_md)
	:set t_mr=^[[0;1;33;44m  " reverse (invert) mode
	:set t_md=^[[1;33;41m    " bold mode
	:set t_se=^[[1;36;40m    " standout end
	:set t_so=^[[1;32;45m    " standout mode
	:set t_ue=^[[0;1;36m     " underline end
	:set t_us=^[[1;32m       " underline mode start

The file "tools/Vim132" is a shell script that can be used to put Vim in 132
column mode on a vt100 and lookalikes.
