README for version 4.2 of Vim: Vi IMproved.

Vim is an almost compatible version of the UNIX editor vi.  Only the "Q"
command is missing.  Many new features have been added: multi level undo,
command line history, filename completion, block operations, etc.  There is
also a Graphical User Interface (GUI) available.  See doc/vim_diff.doc.

This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain ASCII files.
All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally function keys can be
defined by the user.

Vim currently runs under Amiga DOS, MS-DOS, Windows NT, Windows 95, Atari
MiNT, OS/2 and almost all flavours of UNIX.  There are some things included
for the Archimedes, but it does not work yet.  There are people working on a
VMS and a Mac port.  Porting to other systems should not be very difficult.

Documentation:
The best is to use ":help" in Vim.  If you don't have an executable (yet),
read doc/vim_help.txt.  It contains pointers to the other documentation files.

"tutor/readme" is a one hour training course for beginners.

Copying:
Vim is Charityware.  You can copy it as much as you like, but you are
encouraged to make a donation to orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
"doc/vim_kcc.txt" for details.  You are allowed to include Vim on a CD-ROM if
you send me one.

Compiling:
All stuff for compiling Vim is in the "src" directory.  See src/INSTALL for
instructions.
