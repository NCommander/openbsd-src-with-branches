The formats and meanings of all these strings vary among operating systems.
.Pp

.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Behave as though all of the options
.Fl mnrsv
were specified.
.It Fl m
Print the name of the hardware type.
On
.Ox ,
this is the kernel architecture as returned by
.Xr machine 1 .
.It Fl n
Print the network name of this machine.
On
.Ox ,
the same name can be printed with
.Xr hostname 1 .
.It Fl p
Print the application architecture as returned by
.Xr arch 1
.Fl s .
.It Fl r
Print the operating system release.
On
.Ox ,
the format is
.Sm off
.Ar digit . digit Bq \- Ar flavor .
.Sm on
.Pp
The meaning of the
.Pf \- Ar flavor
suffix is as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "no suffix"
.It \-beta
A development version preceding the
.Ar digit . Ns Ar digit
release.
.It no suffix
A public release,
or a development version very closely preceding that release.

A branch based on the
.Ar digit . Ns Ar digit
release that only contains patches to fix very important bugs.
.It \-current
A development version coming after the
.Ar digit . Ns Ar digit
release.
Some time before the subsequent release, the second
.Ar digit
is incremented and the
.Pf \- Ar flavor
switched to \-beta.
.El
.It Fl s
Print the operating system name.
On
.Ox ,
this is always
.Dq Ox .
.It Fl v
Print the operating system version.
On
.Ox ,
the format is
.Ar SYSTEMNAME Ns # Ns Ar buildnumber
with the
.Ar SYSTEMNAME
mentioned in
.Xr config 8 .
.El
.Pp
If no options are specified,
.Nm uname
prints the operating system name as if the
.Fl s
option had been specified.
.Pp
If
.Fl a
or more than one option is specified,
.Ox
prints the selected fields separated by single space characters
in the following order: operating system name, network name,
release, version, kernel architecture, application architecture.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std uname
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr hostname 1 ,
.Xr machine 1 ,
.Xr uname 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification.
.Pp
The flag
.Op Fl p
