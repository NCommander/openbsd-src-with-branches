/*! \file isc/hash.h
 *
 * \brief The hash API
 *	provides an unpredictable hash value for variable length data.
 *	A hash object contains a random vector (which is hidden from clients
 *	of this API) to make the actual hash value unpredictable.
 *
 *	The algorithm used in the API guarantees the probability of hash
 *	collision; in the current implementation, as long as the values stored
 *	in the random vector are unpredictable, the probability of hash
 *	collision between arbitrary two different values is at most 1/2^16.
 *
 *	Although the API is generic about the hash keys, it mainly expects
 *	DNS names (and sometimes IPv4/v6 addresses) as inputs.  It has an
 *	upper limit of the input length, and may run slow to calculate the
 *	hash values for large inputs.
 *
 *	This API is designed to be general so that it can provide multiple
 *	different hash contexts that have different random vectors.  However,
 *	it should be typical to have a single context for an entire system.
 *	To support such cases, the API also provides a single-context mode.
 *
 * \li MP:
 *	The hash object is almost read-only.  Once the internal random vector
 *	is initialized, no write operation will occur, and there will be no
 *	need to lock the object to calculate actual hash values.
 *
 * \li Reliability:
 *	In some cases this module uses low-level data copy to initialize the
 *	random vector.  Errors in this part are likely to crash the server or
 *	corrupt memory.
 *
 * \li Resources:
 *	A buffer, used as a random vector for calculating hash values.
 *
 * \li Security:
 *	This module intends to provide unpredictable hash values in
 *	adversarial environments in order to avoid denial of service attacks
 *	to hash buckets.
 *	Its unpredictability relies on the quality of entropy to build the
 *	random vector.
 *
 * \li Standards:
 *	None.

/*!<
 * \brief Calculate a hash over data.
 *
 * This hash function is useful for hashtables. The hash function is
 * opaque and not important to the caller. The returned hash values are
 * non-deterministic and will have different mapping every time a
 * process using this library is run, but will have uniform
 * distribution.
 *
 * isc_hash_function_reverse() calculates the hash from the
 * end to the start over the input data. The difference in order is
 * useful in incremental hashing; for example, a previously hashed
 * value for 'com' can be used as input when hashing 'example.com'.
 *
 * 'data' is the data to be hashed.
 *
 * 'length' is the size of the data to be hashed.
 *
 * 'case_sensitive' specifies whether the hash key should be treated as
 * case_sensitive values.  It should typically be ISC_FALSE if the hash key
 * is a DNS name.
 *
 * 'previous_hashp' is a pointer to a previous hash value returned by
 * this function. It can be used to perform incremental hashing. NULL
 * must be passed during first calls.
