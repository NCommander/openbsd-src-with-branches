/*****
 ***** Module Info
 *****/

/*! \file isc/task.h
 * \brief The task system provides a lightweight execution context, which is
 * basically an event queue.

 * When a task's event queue is non-empty, the
 * task is runnable.  A small work crew of threads, typically one per CPU,
 * execute runnable tasks by dispatching the events on the tasks' event
 * queues.  Context switching between tasks is fast.
 *
 * \li MP:
 *	The module ensures appropriate synchronization of data structures it
 *	creates and manipulates.
 *	The caller must ensure that isc_taskmgr_destroy() is called only
 *	once for a given manager.
 *
 * \li Reliability:
 *	No anticipated impact.
 *
 * \li Resources:
 *	TBS
 *
 * \li Security:
 *	No anticipated impact.
 *
 * \li Standards:
 *	None.
 *
 * \section purge Purging and Unsending
 *
 * Events which have been queued for a task but not delivered may be removed
 * from the task's event queue by purging or unsending.
 *
 * With both types, the caller specifies a matching pattern that selects
 * events based upon their sender, type, and tag.
 *
 * Purging calls isc_event_free() on the matching events.
 *
 * Unsending returns a list of events that matched the pattern.
 * The caller is then responsible for them.
 *
 * Consumers of events should purge, not unsend.
 *
 * Producers of events often want to remove events when the caller indicates
 * it is no longer interested in the object, e.g. by canceling a timer.
 * Sometimes this can be done by purging, but for some event types, the
 * calls to isc_event_free() cause deadlock because the event free routine
 * wants to acquire a lock the caller is already holding.  Unsending instead
 * of purging solves this problem.  As a general rule, producers should only
 * unsend events which they have sent.
