 * \brief ISC Application Support
 *
 * Dealing with program termination can be difficult, especially in a
 * multithreaded program.  The routines in this module help coordinate
 * the shutdown process.  They are used as follows by the initial (main)
 * thread of the application:
 *
 *\li		isc_app_start();	Call very early in main(), before
 *					any other threads have been created.
 *
 *\li		isc_app_run();		This will post any on-run events,
 *					and then block until application
 *					shutdown is requested.  A shutdown
 *					request is made by calling
 *					isc_app_shutdown(), or by sending
 *					SIGINT or SIGTERM to the process.
 *					After isc_app_run() returns, the
 *					application should shutdown itself.
 *
 *\li		isc_app_finish();	Call very late in main().
 *
 * Use of this module is not required.  In particular, isc_app_start() is
 * NOT an ISC library initialization routine.
 *
 * This module also supports per-thread 'application contexts'.  With this
 * mode, a thread-based application will have a separate context, in which
 * it uses other ISC library services such as tasks or timers.  Signals are
 * not caught in this mode, so that the application can handle the signals
 * in its preferred way.
 *
 * \li MP:
 *	Clients must ensure that isc_app_start(), isc_app_run(), and
 *	isc_app_finish() are called at most once.  isc_app_shutdown()
 *	is safe to use by any thread (provided isc_app_start() has been
 *	called previously).
 *
 *	The same note applies to isc_app_ctxXXX() functions, but in this case
 *	it's a per-thread restriction.
 *
 * \li Reliability:
 *	No anticipated impact.
 *
 * \li Resources:
 *	None.
 *
 * \li Security:
 *	No anticipated impact.
 *
 * \li Standards:
 *	None.
