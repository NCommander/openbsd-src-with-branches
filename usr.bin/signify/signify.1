.Sh NAME
.Nm signify
.Nd cryptographically sign and verify files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm signify
.Op Fl I Ar input
.Op Fl N
.Op Fl O Ar output
.Op Fl P Ar pubkey
.Op Fl S Ar seckey
.Op Fl V Ar generate|sign|verify
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates and verifies cryptographic signatures.
The mode of operation is selected by the verb passed to the
.Ar V
option.
Options are as follows
.Bl -tag -width iPPpubkey
.It Fl I Ar input
Input file to
.Ar sign
or
.Ar verify .
.It Fl N
Do not ask for a passphrase during key generation.
Otherwise,
.Nm
will prompt the user for a passphrase on the tty.
.It Fl O Ar output
The signature file to create or verify.
The default is
.Ar input .sig .
.It Fl P Ar pubkey
Public key produced by
.Ar generate ,
and used by
.Ar verify
to check a signature.
.It Fl S Ar seckey
Secret (private) key produced by
.Ar generate ,
and used by
.Ar sign
to sign a message.
.It Fl V generate|sign|verify
Select the desired operation.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility may fail for the following reasons:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It 
Some necessary files do not exist.
.It
Entered passphrase is incorrect.
.It
The message file was corrupted and its signature does not match.
.It
The message file is too large.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create a new keypair:
.Dl "$ signify -P newkey.pub -S newkey.sec -V generate"
Sign a file, specifying signature name:
.Dl "$ signify -S key.sec -I message.txt -O msg.sig -V sign"
Verify a signature, using the default signature name:
.Dl "$ signify -P key.pub -I generalsorders.txt -V verify"
