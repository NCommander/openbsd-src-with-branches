.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility executes
.Ar command ,
with any
.Ar args ,
and kills it if it is still running after the
specified
.Ar duration .
If
.Ar duration
is 0, the timeout is disabled.

The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl k Ar time , Fl -kill-after Ns = Ns Ar time
Send a second kill signal if the command is still running
.Ar time
after the first signal was sent.
.It Fl s Ar sig , Fl -signal Ns = Ns Ar sig
Specify the signal to send on timeout, instead of the default
.Dv SIGTERM .
.It Fl -foreground
Do not propagate the timeout signal to children processes.
.It Fl -preserve-status
Always exit with the same status as
.Ar command ,
even if the timeout was reached.
