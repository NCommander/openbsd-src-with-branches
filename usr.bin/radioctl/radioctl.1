.Sh NAME
.Nm radioctl
.Nd control radio tuners
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm radioctl
.Op Fl anv
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Nm radioctl
.Op Fl nv
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Ar name
.Nm radioctl
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command displays or sets various variables that affect the radio tuner
behavior.
If a variable is present on the command line,
.Nm
prints the current value of this variable for the specified device.
By default,
.Nm
operates on the
.Pa /dev/radio
device.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Print all device variables and their current values.
This is the default, if no parameters are given to
.Nm .
.It Fl f Ar file
Specify an alternative radio tuner device.
.It Fl n
Suppress printing of the variable name.
.It Fl v
Show the possible values of queries.
.It Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value
Attempt to set the specified variable
.Ar name
to
.Ar value .
.El
.Pp
Values may be specified in either absolute or relative forms.
The relative form is indicated by a prefix of
.Ql +
or
.Ql -
to denote an increase or decrease, respectively.
.Pp
The exact set of controls that can be manipulated depends on
the tuner.
The general format (in both getting and setting a value) is:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Ar name
indicates what part of the tuner the control affects.
.Pp
Write only controls:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar search
Only for cards that allow hardware search.
Can be
.Ql up
or
.Ql down .
.El
.Pp
Read-write controls:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar channel
Specifies the TV channel.
Integer value from 0 to 150.
Using the
.Ar channel
control puts the tuner in
.Dq TV
mode.
.It Ar chnlset
Specifies the TV channel set.
The tuner uses the current channel set to derive a frequency from the
.Ar channel .
The following is a list of valid channel sets:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "australiaXX" -offset indent -compact
.It nabcst
U.S.A. Broadcast
.It cableirc
U.S.A. Cable IRC
.It cablehrc
U.S.A. Cable HRC
.It weurope
Western Europe
.It jpnbcst
Japan Broadcast
.It jpncable
Japan Cable
.It xussr
Former U.S.S.R. and C.I.S. countries
.It australia
Australia
.It france
France
.El
.It Ar frequency
Specifies the FM frequency in MHz.
Float value from 87.5 to 108.0.
Using the
.Ar frequency
control puts the tuner in
.Dq radio
mode.
.It Ar volume
Integer value from 0 to 255.
.It Ar mute
Mutes the card (volume is not affected),
.Ql on
or
.Ql off .
.It Ar mono
Forces card output to mono,
.Ql on
or
.Ql off .
Only for cards that allow forced mono.
.It Ar reference
Reference frequency.
Can be 25 kHz, 50 kHz and 100 kHz.
Not all cards allow the reference frequency to be changed.
.It Ar sensitivity
Station locking sensitivity.
Can be 5 mkV, 10 mkV, 30 mkV and 150 mkV.
Not all cards allow the station locking sensitivity to be changed.
.El
.Pp
All the remaining controls (mode, signal, stereo and card capabilities)
are read-only and can be viewed using option
.Fl a .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variable affects the execution of
.Nm radioctl :
.Bl -tag -width RADIODEVICE
.It Ev RADIODEVICE
The radio tuner device to use.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/radio
.It Pa /dev/radio
radio tuner device
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Print all device variables,
along with their current values:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ radioctl -a
volume=255
channel=0
chnlset=weurope
frequency=106.30MHz
mute=off
reference=50kHz
signal=on
stereo=on
mode: radio
card capabilities:
        manageable mono/stereo
