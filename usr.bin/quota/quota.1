.Sh NAME
.Nm quota
.Nd display disk usage and limits
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm quota
.Op Fl q | v
.Op Fl gu
.Nm quota
.Op Fl q | v
.Fl g
.Ar group ...
.Nm quota
.Op Fl q | v
.Fl u
.Ar user ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm quota
displays users' disk usage and limits.
By default only the user quotas are printed.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl g
Print group quotas for the group
of which the user is a member.
.It Fl q
Print a more terse message,
containing only information
on filesystems where usage is over quota.
This flag takes precedence over the
.Fl v
flag.
.It Fl u
Print user quotas for the user.
This flag is equivalent to the default.
.It Fl v
.Nm quota
will display quotas on filesystems
where no storage is allocated.
.El
.Pp
Only the superuser may use the
.Fl g
and
.Fl u
flags
to view the limits of other groups and users.
Non-superusers can use the
.Fl g
and
.Fl u
flags to view the limits of groups of which they are members as well as
their own user limits.
.Pp
.Nm quota
tries to report the quotas of all mounted filesystems.
If the filesystem is mounted via NFS,
it will attempt to contact the
.Xr rpc.rquotad 8
daemon on the
NFS server.
For FFS
filesystems, quotas must be turned on in
.Pa /etc/fstab .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width quota.group -compact
.It Pa quota.user
located at the filesystem root with user quotas
.It Pa quota.group
located at the filesystem root with group quotas
.It Pa /etc/fstab
to find filesystem names and locations
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm quota
utility exits 0 on success,
and with a non-zero value if one or more
filesystems are over quota.
