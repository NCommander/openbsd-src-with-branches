.Sh NAME
.Nm encrypt
.Nd encrypt passwords from the command line or standard input
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm encrypt
.Op Fl k
.Op Fl m
.Op Fl s Ar salt
.Op Ar string
.Nm makekey
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm encrypt
prints the encrypted form of
.Ar string
to the standard output.  This is mostly useful for encrypting passwords
from within scripts.
.Pp
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width XxXXXXX
.It Fl k
Run in
.Nm makekey
compatible mode; a single combined key and salt are read from standard
input and the DES encrypted result is written to standard output without a
terminating newline.
.It Fl m
Encrypt the string using MD5.
.It Fl s Ar salt
Encrypt the string using DES, with the specified
.Ar salt .
.El
.Pp
If no
.Ar string
is specified,
.Nm encrypt
reads one string per line from standard input, encrypting each one with
the same
.Ar salt .
Specifing the 
.Ar string
on the command line should be discouraged; using the
standard input is more secure.

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm encrypt
first appeared in OpenBSD 1.2.

A
.Nm makekey
command appeared in 
.At v7 .
