.Sh NAME
.Nm encrypt
.Nd encrypt passwords from the command line or standard input
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm encrypt
.Op Fl k
.Op Fl b Ar rounds
.Op Fl m
.Op Fl s Ar salt
.Op Fl p | Ar string
.Nm makekey
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
prints the encrypted form of
.Ar string
to the standard output.  This is mostly useful for encrypting passwords
from within scripts.
.Pp
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width XxXXXXXXX
.It Fl k
Run in
.Nm makekey
compatible mode; a single combined key and salt are read from standard
input and the DES encrypted result is written to standard output without a
terminating newline.
.It Fl b Ar rounds
Encrypt the string using Blowfish hashing with the specified
.Ar rounds .
.It Fl m
Encrypt the string using MD5.
.It Fl p
Prompt for a single string with echo turned off.
.It Fl s Ar salt
Encrypt the string using DES, with the specified
.Ar salt .
.El
.Pp
If no
.Ar string
is specified,
.Nm
reads one string per line from standard input, encrypting each one
with the chosen algorithm from above. In case that no specific algorithm
was given as a command line option, the default will be looked up from
.Pa /etc/passwd.conf .
.Pp
For MD5 and Blowfish a new random salt is automatically generated for each
password.
.Pp
Specifying the
.Ar string
on the command line should be discouraged; using the
standard input is more secure.

command appeared in
.At v7 .
