.Nd determine file type
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl bchiLsW
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility tests each argument and attempts to determine its type.
Three sets of tests are performed:
.Bl -enum -offset Ds
.It
Filesystem tests, for example if a file is empty, or a special file such as a
socket or named pipe (FIFO).
.It
.Dq Magic
tests for data in particular fixed formats.
These are loaded from the
.Pa /etc/magic
file (or
.Pa ~/.magic
instead if it exists and
.Nm
is not running as root).
The file format is described in
.Xr magic 5 .
.It
Tests for text files such as plain ASCII or C programming language files.
.El
.Pp
The first test which succeeds causes the file type to be printed.
The type will often contain one of the words
.Em text
(contains only printing characters and is probably safe to read on an ASCII
terminal),
.Em executable
(the file contains a compiled executable program)
or
.Em data
meaning anything else.
.Pp
If
.Ar file
is a single dash
.Pq Sq - ,
.Nm
reads from the standard input.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b , -brief
Does not prepend filenames to output lines.
.It Fl c
Prints a summary of the parsed magic file; usually used for debugging.
.It Fl h
Causes symlinks not to be followed.
This is the default.
.It Fl i , -mime , -mime-type
Outputs MIME type strings rather than the more
traditional human-readable ones.
Thus it may say
.Dq text/plain
rather than
.Dq ASCII text .
.It Fl L , -dereference
Causes symlinks to be followed.
.It Fl s
Attempts to read block and character device files, not just regular files.
.It Fl W
Displays warnings when parsing the magic file or applying its tests.
Usually used for debugging.
