.Dt RPCINFO 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rpcinfo
.Nd report RPC information
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rpcinfo
.Fl b Ar program version
.Nm rpcinfo
.Fl d Ar program version
.Nm rpcinfo
.Fl p Op Ar host
.Nm rpcinfo
.Fl s Ar program version port
.Nm rpcinfo
.Op Fl n Ar portnum
.Fl t Ar host program
.Op Ar version
.Nm rpcinfo
.Op Fl n Ar portnum
.Fl u Ar host program
.Op Ar version
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
makes an
.Tn RPC
call to an
.Tn RPC
server and reports what it finds.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Make an
.Tn RPC
broadcast to procedure 0 of the specified
.Ar program
and
.Ar version
using
.Tn UDP
and report all hosts that respond.
.It Fl d
Delete registration for the
.Tn RPC
service of the specified
.Ar program
and
.Ar version .
Registrations which point at ports numbered below 1024 can only be
deleted by the superuser.
.It Fl n Ar portnum
Use
.Ar portnum
as the port number for the
.Fl t
and
.Fl u
options instead of the port number given by the portmapper.
.It Fl p
Probe the portmapper on
.Ar host ,
and print a list of all registered
.Tn RPC
programs.
If
.Ar host
is not specified, it defaults to the value returned by
.Xr hostname 1 .
.It Fl s
Create a registration for the
.Tn RPC
service of the specified
.Ar program
and
.Ar version ,
located at port
.Ar port .
Registrations which point at ports numbered below 1024 can only be
created (or changed) by the superuser.
.It Fl t
Make an
.Tn RPC
call to procedure 0 of
.Ar program
on the specified
.Ar host
using
.Tn TCP ,
and report whether a response was received.
.It Fl u
Make an
.Tn RPC
call to procedure 0 of
.Ar program
on the specified
.Ar host
using
.Tn UDP ,
and report whether a response was received.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar program
argument can be either a name or a number.
.Pp
If a
.Ar version
is specified,
.Nm
attempts to call that version of the specified
.Ar program .
Otherwise,
.Nm
attempts to find all the registered version
numbers for the specified
.Ar program
by calling version 0 (which is presumed not
to exist; if it does exist,
.Nm
attempts to obtain this information by calling
an extremely high version
number instead) and attempts to call each registered version.
Note: the version number is required for
.Fl b
and
.Fl d
options.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To show all of the
.Tn RPC
services registered on the local machine use:
.Pp
.Dl $ rpcinfo -p
.Pp
To show all of the
.Tn RPC
services registered on the machine named
.Ar klaxon
use:
.Pp
.Dl $ rpcinfo -p klaxon
.Pp
To show all machines on the local net that are running the Yellow Pages
service use:
.Pp
.Dl $ rpcinfo -b ypserv 'version' | uniq
.Pp
where 'version' is the current Yellow Pages version obtained from the
results of the
.Fl p
switch above.
.Pp
To delete the registration for version 1 of the
.Nm walld
service use:
.Pp
.Dl $ rpcinfo -d walld 1
