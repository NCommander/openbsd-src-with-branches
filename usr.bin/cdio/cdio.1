.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is a compact disc control utility,
with support for playing audio CDs and Track-At-Once (TAO) CD writing.
.Pp
If no command is given,
.Nm
enters interactive mode, reading commands from the standard input.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Fl d
.Ar host : Ns Ar port
.Xc
Specifies a CDDB host
.Bq default: gnudb.gnudb.org:8880 .
.It Fl f Ar device
Specifies the name of the CD device, such as
.Pa /dev/rcd0c .
Both absolute and relative paths to
.Pa /dev
filenames are possible;
the raw partition name is added if needed.
.It Fl s
Silent mode.
Do not print table headers or human-readable comments.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
A second occurrence of
.Fl v
causes even more information to be printed.
.El
.Pp
The available commands are listed below.
Only as many characters as are required to uniquely identify a command
need be specified.
If no command is given,
only a track number or range,
then
.Ic play
is assumed.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic blank
Minimally blank the disc.
.It Ic cddbinfo Op Ar n
Print the Table Of Contents (TOC) after matching the disc with the CDDB.
In case of multiple matches, reissue the command with
.Ar n .
.It Ic cdid
Print the disc ID that will be used for matching with the CDDB.
.It Ic cdplay Op Ar track1-trackN ...
Play specified tracks from disk.
Unlike
.Ic play ,
the CD player need not be connected to an audio device;
instead it rips tracks from disk and outputs audio data to
the default audio device.
Both individual tracks and track ranges may be specified.
If range is specified in descending order tracks will be played in descending order.
If the first value in the range is omitted, tracks from first track on disk to the specified one will be played.
If the last value in the range is omitted, tracks from the specified track to the last track on disk will be played.
.It Ic cdrip Op Ar track1-trackN ...
Rip specified tracks from disk.
Audio tracks are saved as WAVE sound files.
All tracks will be saved in the current working directory.
If parameters are omitted, all tracks are ripped.
Both individual tracks and track ranges may be specified, in the same format as the
.Ic cdplay
command.
.It Ic close
Inject the disc.
.It Ic debug Ar on | off
Enable/disable the debugging mode of the CD device driver.
.It Ic device Ar devname

.It Ic help

the complete list of supported profiles
and a hex dump of each current feature is printed.

Play the next track.
If we're at the last track, stop.
