.SH DESCRIPTION 
.LP
.B Scp
copies files between hosts on a network.  It uses
.B ssh
for data transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the
same security as
.B ssh.
Unlike
.BR rcp ",
.B ssh
will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed for
authentication.
.LP
Any file name may contain a host and user specification to indicate
that the file is to be copied to/from that host.  Copies between two
remote hosts are permitted.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP 0.6i
.BI \-c "\ cipher
Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfer.  This
option is directly passed to
.B ssh.
.TP
.BI \-i "\ identity_file
Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for RSA
authentication is read.  This option is directly passed to
.B ssh.
.TP
.B \-p
Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the
original file.
.TP
.B \-r
Recursively copy entire directories.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode.  Causes
.B scp
and 
.B ssh
to print debugging messages about their progress.  This is helpful in
debugging connection, authentication, and configuration problems.
.TP
.B \-B
Selects batch mode (prevents asking for passwords or passphrases).
.TP
.B \-C
Compression enable.  Passes the -C flag to
.B ssh
to enable compression.
.TP
.BI \-P "\ port
Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.  Note that this
option is written with a capital P, because \-p is already reserved for
preserving the times and modes of the file in rcp.
