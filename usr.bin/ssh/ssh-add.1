.SH NAME
ssh-add \- adds identities for the authentication agent

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ssh-add
[\c
.B \-l\c
]
[\c
.B \-d\c
]
[\c
.B \-D\c
]
[\c
.B file\c
\&.\|.\|.\|]

.SH DESCRIPTION 
.LP
.B Ssh-add
adds identities to the authentication agent,
.B ssh-agent.
When run without arguments, it adds the file
.IR $HOME/\s+2.\s0ssh/identity ".
Alternative file names can be given on the
command line.  If any file requires a passphrase,
.B ssh-add
asks for the passphrase from the user.  If the user is using X11, the
passphrase is requested using a small X11 program; otherwise it is
read from the user's tty.  (Note: it may be necessary to redirect
stdin from /dev/null to get the passphrase requested using X11.)
.LP
The authentication agent must be running and must be an ancestor of
the current process for
.B ssh-add
to work.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 0.5i
.B \-l
Lists all identities currently represented by the agent.
.TP
.B \-d
Instead of adding the identity, removes the identity from the agent.
.TP
.B \-D
Deletes all identities from the agent.

.SH FILES
.TP 
.I \&$HOME/\s+2.\s0ssh/identity
Contains the RSA authentication identity of the user.  This file
should not be readable by anyone but the user.  It is possible to
specify a passphrase when generating the key; that passphrase will be
used to encrypt the private part of this file.  This is the
default file added by
.B ssh-add
when no other files have been specified.
.IP
If
.B ssh-add
needs a passphrase, it will read the passphrase from the current
terminal if it was run from a terminal.  If
.B ssh-add
does not have a terminal associated with it but
.SM DISPLAY\s0
is set, it
will open an X11 window to read the passphrase.  This is particularly
useful when calling
.B ssh-add
from a .Xsession or related script.  (Note that on some machines it
may be necessary to redirect the input from /dev/null to make this work.)
