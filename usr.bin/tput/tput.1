.Sh NAME
.Nm tput ,
.Nm clear
.Nd terminal capability interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tput
.Op Fl T Ar term
.Ar attribute
.Op Ar attribute-args
.Ar ...
.Nm tput
.Op Fl T Ar term
.Fl S
.Nm clear
.Op Fl T Ar term
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility makes terminal-dependent information available to users or shell
applications.
When invoked as
.Nm clear
it provides the same functionality as
.Nm tput Cm clear .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl S
The attributes are read from stdin instead of the command line.
.It Fl T
The terminal name as found in the
.Xr terminfo 5
database; for example,
.Dq vt100
or
.Dq xterm .
If not specified,
.Nm
retrieves the
.Ev TERM
variable from the environment.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
outputs a string if the
.Ar attribute
is of type string or a number if it is of type integer.
If the
.Ar attribute
is of type boolean,
.Nm
exits 0 if the terminal has the capability or 1 if it
does not.
Each
.Ar attribute
should be a string defined in either
.Xr terminfo 5
or
.Xr termcap 5 .
.Pp
If the
.Ar attribute
is of type string and takes arguments (e.g., cursor movement,
the
.Xr terminfo 5
.Dq cup
sequence) the arguments are taken from the command line immediately
following the attribute.
.Pp
The following special attributes are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It clear
Clear the screen (the
.Xr terminfo 5
.Dq clear
sequence).
.It init
Print the
.Xr terminfo 5
initialization strings for the specified terminal.
.It longname
Print the descriptive name of the user's terminal type.
.It reset
Reset the terminal (using the
.Xr terminfo 5
reset sequences).
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ev TERM
Determine the terminal type.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The exit value of
.Nm
is based on the last attribute specified.
If the attribute is of type string or of type integer the exit
value is as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width Ds -compact
.It 0
The requested string was written successfully.
.It 2
Usage error.
.It 3
Unknown terminal type.
.It 4
Unknown attribute name.
.It >4
An error occurred.
.El
.Pp
If the attribute is of type boolean,
.Nm
exits with a value of 0 if the terminal has this attribute or
1 if it does not.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Clear the screen and go to line 5 column 10:
.Pp
.Dl $ tput clear cup 5 10
.Pp
Go to line 6 column 11 and delete 6 characters:
.Pp
.Dl $ tput cup 6 11 dch 6
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr terminfo 3 ,
.Xr terminfo 5
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification.
.Pp
The flag
.Op Fl S
and the attribute
.Cm longname
are extensions to that specification.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm clear
utility first appeared in
.Bx 2 .
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
can't really distinguish between different types of attributes.
