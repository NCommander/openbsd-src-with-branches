.Sh NAME
.Nm audioctl
.Nd control audio device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl n
.Fl a
.Nm ""
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl n
.Ar name ...
.Nm ""
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl n
.Fl w
.Ar name=value ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
command displays or sets various audio system driver variables.
If a list of variables is present on the command line, then
.Nm
prints the current value of those variables for the specified device.
If the 
.Fl a
flag is specified, all variables for the device are printed.
If the
.Fl w
flag is specified
.Nm
attempts to set the specified variables to the given values.
.Pp
The
.Fl f
flag can be used to give an alternative audio control device, the default is
.Pa /dev/audioctl .
.Pp
The
.Fl n
flag suppresses printing of the variable name.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To set the playing sampling rate to 11025 you can enter
.Dl audioctl -w play.sample_rate=11025
Note that many of the variables that can be inspected and changed
with
.Nm
are reset when the device is opened.  This can be circumvented
like this
.Dl (cat file.au; audioctl -f /dev/stdout -a) > /dev/audio
or
.Dl (audioctl -f /dev/stdout -w blocksize=1024; cat file.au) > /dev/audio
.Sh FILES
