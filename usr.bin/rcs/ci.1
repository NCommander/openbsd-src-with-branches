.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is used to check new revisions into RCS files.
.Pp
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Op Ar date
Uses
.Ar date
for check-in date and time.
If
.Ar date
is not specified, use the working file's last modification time.
.It Fl f
Force check in.
.It Fl I
Interactive mode.
.It Fl k Ar mode
Specify the keyword substitution mode.
.It Fl l Op Ar rev
The same as
.Fl r ,
but also immediately checks out the deposited revision and locks it.
This is useful if you wish to continue to edit the working file after check-in.
.It Fl M
Set the modification time of the file to the date of the
retrieved revision.
.It Fl m Ar msg
Specify a log message.
A line beginning with a hash character
.Pq Sq #
is considered a comment and ignored.
.It Fl q
Be quiet about reporting.
.It Fl r Op Ar rev
Check in revision
.Ar rev .
However, if
.Ar rev
is not specified the meaning is completely different \- override any
.Fl l
or
.Fl u Op Ar rev
options, ensuring the default behaviour of releasing a lock and removing the
working file.
.It Fl s Ar state
Sets the state of the deposited revision to the identifier
.Ar state .
.It Fl u
The same as
.Fl r ,
but also immediately checks out the deposited revision read-only.
Useful if you wish to read the working file after check-in.
.It Fl V
Print RCS's version number.
.It Fl w Ar user
Uses
.Ar user
as the author field of the deposited revision.
If the
.Ar user
argument is omitted, the login of the user issuing the command
is assumed.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width RCSINIT
.It Ev RCSINIT

are prepended to the argument list.
