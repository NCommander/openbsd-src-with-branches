.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is used to check new revisions into RCS files.
.Pp
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Ns Op Ar date
Uses
.Ar date
for check-in date and time.
If
.Ar date
is not specified, use the working file's last modification time.
.It Fl f Ns Op Ar rev
Force check in - optionally to
.Ar rev
- even if no changes have been made to the working file.
.It Fl I
Interactive mode.
.It Fl k Ns Ar mode
Specify the keyword substitution mode.
.It Fl l Ns Op Ar rev
The same as
.Fl r ,
but also immediately checks out the deposited revision and locks it.
This is useful if you wish to continue to edit the working file after check-in.
.It Fl M
Set the modification time of the file to the date of the
retrieved revision.
.It Fl m Ns Ar msg
Specify a log message.
A line beginning with a hash character
.Pq Sq #
is considered a comment and ignored.
.It Fl q
Be quiet about reporting.
.It Fl r Ns Op Ar rev
Check in revision
.Ar rev .
However, if
.Ar rev
is not specified the meaning is completely different \- override any
.Fl l
or
.Fl u Op Ar rev
options, ensuring the default behaviour of releasing a lock and removing the
working file.
.It Fl s Ns Ar state
Sets the state of the deposited revision to the identifier
.Ar state .
.It Fl u
The same as
.Fl r ,
but also immediately checks out the deposited revision read-only.
Useful if you wish to read the working file after check-in.
.It Fl V
Print RCS's version number.
.It Fl w Ns Ar user
Uses
.Ar user
as the author field of the deposited revision.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
