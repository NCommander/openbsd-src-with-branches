.Sh NAME
.Nm cvsignore
.Nd list of files and patterns ignored by CVS
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file provides a list of files (or
.Xr sh 1
file name patterns) that should be ignored by
.Xr cvs 1
during the
.Ic import ,
.Ic release ,
and
.Ic update
commands.
.Pp
The syntax of the
.Nm
file consists of a series of lines, each of which contains a
space-separated list of filenames.
There is currently no way of using comments in this file.
.Pp
Default patterns that are ignored by
.Xr cvs 1
are as follows:
.Bd -filled
CVS,
RCS,
RCSLOG,
SCCS,
TAGS,
tags,
core,
cvslog*,
*.o,
*.so,
*.a,
*.bak,
*.orig,
*.rej,
*.old,
*.exe,
*.depend,
*.obj,
*.elc,
*.ln,
*.olb,
*.core,
.#*,
*~,
_$*,
*$,
#*,
,*.
.Ed
.Pp
The list can be modified using the methods described below:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
The
.Pa $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvsignore
file appends patterns to ignore for the whole repository.
.It
The
.Pa $HOME/.cvsignore
file appends patterns to ignore for user only.
.It
The content of the
.Ev CVSIGNORE
variable is appended to the list.
.It
Options to the command line
.Fl I
flag, available for the
.Ic import
and
.Ic update
commands, appends patterns for the current command line action only.
.It
.Pa .cvsignore
files placed in the repository directories allow to add patterns to
ignore locally.
They do not take effect on sub-directories.
.El
.Pp
The
.Sq !\&
character can be used to reset the list of patterns using any of these
five methods.
.Pp
For the
.Ic update
command,
.Xr cvs 1
handles files that are already present in the repository even if they
are in the list to ignore.
Files that are in the list to ignore but not in the repository will not
be listed.
This way, files preceeded by the
.Sq ?\&
character will not appear even if they should.
