.Sh NAME
.Nm cvsd.conf
.Nd CVS daemon configuration file format
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
configuration file format is used by the
.Xr cvsd 8
server.
The server's configuration file is read upon startup and reparsed on every
server restart.
.Pp
It is a human-readable text file consisting of one-line directives that
the server handles to modify its configuration and Access Control List rules
to control operations on the repository.
Comments can be inserted anywhere in the file by putting a '#' character
before them and span to the end of the line.
.Pp
To simplify maintenance of the configuration, the format allows for the
definition of variables that can later be used for interpolation throughout
the configuration file by preceding them with the '$' character.
These variables are refered to as macros.
.Sh DIRECTIVES
The following directives are supported by the server:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxx
.It Sy cvsroot Ar path
Set the server's CVS root directory to
.Ar path .
.It Sy listen Ar addr
Add the address
.Ar addr
to the list of addresses on which the server will listen for incoming
connections.
This is currently parsed but ignored, as the CVS daemon doesn't support
direct TCP connections yet.
.It Sy minchild Ar num
Set the server's minimum number of child processes to
.Ar num .
.It Sy maxchild Ar num
Set the server's maximum number of child processes to
.Ar num .
.It Sy reqsock Ar path
Set the server's local socket path to
.Ar path .
In order for this to work, the
.Xr cvs 1
client must be aware of the socket's path.
.El
.Sh ACL GRAMMAR
The Access Control Lists grammar is expressed in BNF (Backus-Naur Form)
notation.
In this representation, terminals are displayed as normal text and nonterminals
are in bold.
.Po
.Ql [
and
.Ql \&]
.Pc
is optional.
The pipe character
.Pq Ql \&|
is used to separate multiple choices.
.Pp
Here is the BNF syntax for
.Nm
rules:
.Bl -tag -width "this is a test"
.It Ic line
::=
.It Ic rule
::=
.Ic action
.Bo
.Ic optlist
.Bc
.Ic op
[ branch
.Ic branch
]
.Pp
[ from
.Ic userlist
]
.It Ic action
::= allow | deny
.It Ic option
::= quick | log
.It Ic optlist
::=
.Ic option
|
.Ic optlist ,
.Ic option
.It Ic op
::= add | commit | tag | update
.It Ic userlist
::=
.El
.Pp
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following rule denies all operations:
.Bd -literal
	deny quick any
.Ed
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/cvsd.conf -compact
.It Pa /etc/cvsd.conf
Default configuration file for
.Xr cvsd 8 .
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cvs 1 ,
.Xr rcsfile 5 ,
.Xr cvsd 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
file format was introduced along with the CVS daemon as part of the
OpenCVS project.
