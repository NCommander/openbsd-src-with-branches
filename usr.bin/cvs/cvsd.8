.Sh NAME
.Nm cvsd
.Nd Concurrent Versions System daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm cvsd
.Op Fl dfhpv
.Op Fl c Ar config
.Op Fl g Ar group
.Op Fl r Ar cvsroot
.Op Fl s Ar sockpath
.Op Fl u Ar user
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon manages access to a CVS repository.
It provides a much more secure alternative to the traditional client-server
model commonly used by
.Xr cvs 1
through various mechanisms described below.
.Pp
On startup, 
.Nm
spawns a child process that chroots to the CVS repository's root directory.
Both processes then drop privileges to user and group
.Ic _cvsd .
Once this is done, the child process loads the list of ACLs and opens a local
socket on which it listens for requests.
The parent process' only purpose is to answer requests for things outside of
the child's jail.
.Pp
.Nm
provides a way to apply Access Control Lists on the modules based on
operation, path, tags and users.
In order to enforce ACLs and prevent users from modifying the files in the
repository directly, all of the files within the repository should be owned
by the user and group
.Ic _cvsd
and should only be writable by the user.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-s sockpath"
.It Fl c Ar config
Use
.Ar config
as the startup configuration file instead of the default one.
.It Fl d
Start the server with debugging enabled.
This option overrides the
.Fl v
option.
.It Fl f
Stay in foreground instead of performing the usual operations to become
a daemon.
This causes all log messages to be printed on standard input or standard
error, depending on the priority of each message.
.It Fl g Ar group
Drop group privileges to the group name or GID specified by
.Ar group
instead of the default group.
.It Fl h
Print information about the server's usage and exit.
.It Fl p
On startup, perform a check on the whole contents of the CVS repository to
check file permissions and ownership, and print warnings for any files or
directories that do not match the expected permission masks.
When running with this option,
.Nm
will exit with an error message if any of the files have permissions that are
too open.
.It Fl r Ar cvsroot
Use
.Ar cvsroot
as the CVS repository's root directory.
.It Fl s Ar sockpath
Use the path specified by
.Ar sockpath
as the file to bind to for the local socket.
.It Fl u Ar user
Drop user privileges to the username or UID specified by
.Ar user
instead of the default user.
.It Fl v
Be verbose.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/cvsd.sock -compact
.It Pa /etc/cvsd.conf
Standard configuration file for the server.
.It Pa /var/run/cvsd.pid
Process ID of the currently running
.Nm .
.It Pa /var/run/cvsd.sock
Default listening socket for incoming cvs requests.
