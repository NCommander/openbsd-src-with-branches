OpenCVS README
==============

This release of OpenCVS is for OpenBSD systems only.
Please consult http://www.opencvs.org/ for portable release availability.

This is a BSD-licensed equivalent of the popular versioning system
CVS.  It is currently in development and thus is not yet suited to replace
GNU CVS entirely, so is not yet enabled in /usr/src/usr.bin/Makefile.
This program should NOT be used on a development tree unless
you don't care about losing your modifications due to possible bugs.

To build and install this release on your OpenBSD system, do the following:

	# cd /usr/src/usr.bin/cvs
	# make obj
	# make cleandir
	# make && make install

The OpenCVS binary will be installed as /usr/bin/opencvs to
prevent people from accidently overwriting their GNU CVS binary for now.

See http://www.opencvs.org/ for more information.
