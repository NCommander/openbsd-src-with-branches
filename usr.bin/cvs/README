OpenCVS README
==============

This release of OpenCVS is for OpenBSD systems only.
Please consult http://www.opencvs.org/ for portable release availability.

This is a BSD-licensed equivalent of the popular versioning system
CVS.  It is currently in development and thus is not yet suited to replace
GNU CVS entirely.  This program should NOT be used on development tree unless
you don't care about losing your modifications due to possible bugs.


To extract and install this release on your OpenBSD system, do the following:

	# cd /usr/src/usr.bin
	# tar -xvzf opencvs-X_Y.tar.gz
	# cd cvs
	# make obj
	# make cleandir
	# make
	# make install

To preserve the GNU CVS binary, it is recommended that you first rename it:

	# cd /usr/bin
	# mv cvs gcvs

The cvs daemon is not yet ready so there are no additional steps required
for the moment.

See http://www.opencvs.org/ for more information.
