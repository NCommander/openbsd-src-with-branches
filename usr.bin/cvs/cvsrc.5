.Dt CVSRC 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm cvsrc
.Nd startup resource file for CVS
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The cvsrc file provides a way to give the
.Xr cvs 1
program implicit global options and command-specific options.
The file is read on startup unless the
.Fl f
option is specified.
.Pp
The format of each line is as follows:
.Pp
.Dl command [arg ...]
.Pp
where
.Ar command
is either the `cvs' keyword to specify global options, one of the supported
.Xr cvs 1
commands or a command alias.
Arguments following
.Ar command
will be added implicitly to the appropriate command's argument vector if it is
run.
Empty lines and lines specifying no optional arguments are ignored.
Lines whose
.Ar command
argument is not a valid command will generate a warning when running without
the
.Fl q
or
.Fl Q
flags.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Need to put in some examples!
