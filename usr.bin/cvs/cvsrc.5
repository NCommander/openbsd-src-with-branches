.Dt CVSRC 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm cvsrc
.Nd startup resource file for CVS
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file provides a way to give the
.Xr cvs 1
program implicit global options and command-specific options.
Unless the
.Fl f
option is specified,
.Xr cvs 1
reads its startup configuration file
.Pa .cvsrc
from the home directory of the user who invoked it.
.Pp
The format of each line is as follows:
.Pp
.Dl command [arg ...]
.Pp
where
.Ar command
is either the `cvs' keyword to specify global options, one of the supported
.Xr cvs 1
commands or a command alias.
Arguments following
.Ar command
will be added implicitly to the appropriate command's argument vector if it is
run.
Empty lines and lines specifying no optional arguments are ignored.
Lines whose
.Ar command
argument is not a valid command will generate a warning when running without
the
.Fl q
or
.Fl Q
flags.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Specify that
.Xr cvs 1
should always run in quiet mode and the
.Ic diff
internal command should always produce unified output:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cvs -q
diff -u
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cvs 1
