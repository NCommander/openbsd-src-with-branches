 * The cvs_file structure is used to represent any file or directory within

 * directory in which the cvs command was executed.  The <cf_parent> field
 * points back to the parent node in the directory tree structure (it is
 * NULL if the directory is at the wd of the command).
 *
 * The <cf_cvstat> field gives the file's status with regards to the CVS
 * repository.  The file can be in any one of the CVS_FST_* states.
 * If the file's type is DT_DIR, then the <cf_ddat> pointer will point to
 * a cvs_dir structure containing data specific to the directory (such as
 * the contents of the directory's CVS/Entries, CVS/Root, etc.).
