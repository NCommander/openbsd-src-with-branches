/*
 * Repository locks
 * ================
 *
 * OpenCVS derives from the standard CVS mechanism in the way it manages locks
 * on the repository.  GNU CVS uses files with 'rfl' and 'wfl' extensions for
 * read and write locks on particular directories.
 * Using the filesystem for locking semantics has one major drawback: a lock
 * can stay even after the process that created it is gone, if it didn't
 * perform the appropriate cleanup.  This stale lock problem has been known
 * to happen with GNU CVS and an intervention from one of the repository
 * administrators is required before anyone else can access parts of the
 * repository.
 * In OpenCVS, a child cvsd needing to access a particular part of the tree
 * must first request a lock on that part of the tree by issuing a
 * CVS_MSG_LOCK message with the appropriate path.  Although the code
 * supports locking at the file level, it should only be applied to the
 * directory level to avoid extra overhead.  Both read and write locks can be
 * obtained, though with different behaviour.  Multiple simultaneous read locks
 * can be obtained on the same entry, but there can only be one active write
 * lock.  In the case where the directory
 * is already locked by another child, a lock wait is added to that entry
 * and the child requesting the lock will get a CVSD_MSG_LOCKPEND reply,
 * meaning that the lock has not been obtained but the child should block
 * until it receives a CVSD_MSG_OK or CVSD_MSG_ERR telling it whether it
 * obtained the lock or not.  When a child is done modifying the locked portion
 * it should release its lock using the CVSD_MSG_UNLOCK request with the path.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *  * The current locking mechanism allows a lock to be obtained on a
 *    subportion of a part that has already been locked by another process.
 *  * A lock on a directory only allows the owner to modify RCS files found
 *    within that directory.  Any modifications on subdirectories require the
 *    process to lock those subdirectories as well.
