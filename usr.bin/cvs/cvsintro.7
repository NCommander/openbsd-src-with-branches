.Nd introduction to Concurrent Versioning System
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Concurrent Versions System is a popular open source version control system.
Although it is mostly used to track changes to software source code for
development teams, there are very few limitations to the kind of data that
can be managed by the system, and it can be used for document archival
purposes as well.
.Pp
This document provides an introduction to using OpenCVS to manage repositories.
It will first cover some of the aspects of using and managing CVS and,
where appropriate, explain the main differences between OpenCVS and other
distributions.

.Sh CREATING A REPOSITORY
Before CVS can be used, a repository must be created.
A repository is simply a directory where the CVS daemon can store the version
information for the files that it will host.

.Sh HISTORY
The OpenCVS project is a BSD-licensed rewrite of the original
Concurrent Versioning System written by Jean-Francois Brousseau.
The original CVS code was written in large parts by Dick Grune,
Brian Berliner, and Jeff Polk.

.Sh CAVEATS
This CVS implementation does not fully conform to the GNU CVS version.
In some cases, this was done explicitly because GNU CVS has inconsistencies
or ambiguous behaviour.
Some things have also been left out or modified to enhance the overall
security of the system.
.Pp
Among other things, support for the pserver connection mechanism has been
dropped because of security issues with the authentication mechanism.
