.Sh NAME
.Nm cvs
.Nd OpenCVS Concurrent Versioning System client
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl flQqv
.Op Fl d Ar root
.Op Fl e Ar editor
.Ar command Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program acts as both client and server for the use of and administration of
a CVS source repository.
CVS is used to maintain version information on files that are kept in a
repository.
Although it is more commonly used to track changes in source code, there
are no real limitations to the type of files that you can store in a
repository.
.Pp
Unless the
.Fl f
option is specified,
.Nm
reads its startup configuration file
.Pa .cvsrc
from the home directory of the user who invoked it.
This file is used to specify implicit options passed to
.Nm
or one of its commands whenever it is invoked.
Each command should be specified on a separate line along with the arguments.
For example, the following two lines:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact -offset indent
.It
cvs -q
.It
diff -u
.El
.Pp
specify that
.Nm
should always run in quiet mode and the
.Sy diff
command should always produce unified output.
.Pp
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Ar root
Use
.Ar root
as the path to the root directory of the CVS repository.
The value must specify an absolute path.
.It Fl e Ar editor
Use the program
.Ar editor
whenever editing log information.
This option overrides the environment variables CVSEDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR.
.It Fl f
Do not read the user's configuration file on startup.
.It Fl l
Suppress logging of history information.
.It Fl Q
Be extra quiet.
Only error messages will be displayed.
.It Fl q
Be quiet about reporting.
.It Fl v
Display version information and exit.
.El
.Sh COMMANDS
The following commands are supported by
.Nm .
.Bl -tag -width "xxxxxxxxxxxx"
.It Xo Sy add Op Fl m Ar msg
.Ar file Op ...
.Xc
.Pp
Before a file is known to CVS, it must be added to the repository using
this command.
Adding a file does not actually publish the contents of the
file, so you must
.Sy commit
the first revision in order to let other users see the file with the
.Sy update
or
.Sy checkout
commands.
.Pp
Although adding a file does not involve a log message, it is possible to
specify one to include with the action, using the
.Fl m
option.
.It Xo Sy checkout
.Op Fl c
.Op Ar module ...
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Sy checkout
command is used to create a local copy of one or more modules present on the
target CVS repository.
.It Xo Sy commit
.Op Fl flnR
.Op Fl F Ar logfile
.Op Fl m Ar msg
.Op Fl r Ar rev
.Op Ar file ...
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Sy commit
command is used to send local changes back to the server and update the
repository's information to reflect the changes.
.It Xo Sy diff Op Fl cilu
.Op Fl D Ar date
.Op Fl r Ar rev
.Op Ar file ...
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Sy diff
command is very similar to the
.Xr diff 1
program, except that the differential comparisons that it generates are
between local or remote revisions of files stored in the CVS repository.
.It Xo Sy update
.Op Fl ACdP
.Op Ar file ...
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Sy update
command is used to merge any of the changes that have occured on the remote
repository into the local one where the command was run.
.Pp
The
.Fl A
flag resets any sticky tags, dates, or kopts that have been set on the tree.
The
.Fl l
flag is used to specify a local change only and disables the recursive
behaviour.
The
.Fl P
flag causes
.Nm
to prune any directories that have become empty as a result of the update.
.It Sy version
Causes
.Nm
to print its version information.
If this command is issued within a local copy of a repository located on
an other machine,
.Nm
will also connect to the server and ask it to print its version information.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width CVS_CLIENT_LOG
.It Ev CVS_CLIENT_LOG
This variable enables logging of all communications between the client and
server when running in non-local mode.
If set, this environment variable must contain a base path from which two
paths will be generated by appending ".in" to the value for the server's
input and ".out" for the server's output.
.It Ev CVS_RSH
Name of the program to use when connecting to the server through a remote
shell.
The default is to use the
.Xr ssh 1
program.
.It Ev CVS_SERVER
If set, gives the name of the program to invoke as a
.Nm
server when using remote shell.
The default is to use `cvs'.
.It Ev CVSEDITOR
Name of the editor to use when editing commit messages.
Checked before
.Ev EDITOR
and
.Ev VISUAL .
.It Ev CVSROOT
When set, this variable should contain the string pointing to the root
directory of the CVS repository.
The contents of this variable are ignored when the
.Fl d
option is given or if `Root' files exist in the checked-out copy.
.It Ev EDITOR
Name of the editor to use when editing commit messages.
This is traditionally a line-oriented editor,
such as
.Xr ex 1 .
.It Ev VISUAL
Name of the editor to use when editing commit messages.
This is traditionally a screen-oriented editor,
such as
.Xr vi 1 .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa $HOME/.cvsrc
File containing a list of implicit options to pass to certain commands.
This file is read on startup unless the
.Fl f
option is specified.
.It Pa $CVSROOT/CVSROOT
Directory containing repository administrative files.
.It Pa $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/loginfo
File containing associations between modules and handlers for
post-commit logging.

.Sh HISTORY
The OpenCVS project is a BSD-licensed rewrite of the original
Concurrent Versioning System written by Jean-Francois Brousseau.
The original CVS code was written in large parts by Dick Grune,
Brian Berliner and Jeff Polk.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Jean-Francois Brousseau
.An Vincent Labrecque
.An Joris Vink
.Sh CAVEATS
This CVS implementation does not fully conform to the GNU CVS version.
In some cases, this was done explicitly because GNU CVS has inconsistencies
or ambiguous behaviour.
Some things have also been left out or modified to enhance the overall
security of the system.
.Pp
Among other things, support for the pserver connection mechanism has been
dropped because of security issues with the authentication mechanism.
