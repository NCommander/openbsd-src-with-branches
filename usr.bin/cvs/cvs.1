.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program acts as both client and server for the use of and administration of
a CVS source repository.
CVS is used to maintain version information on files that are kept in a
repository.
Although it is more commonly used to track changes in source code, there
are no real limitations to the type of files that you can store in a
repository.
.Pp
Unless the
.Fl f
option is specified,
.Nm
reads its startup configuration file
.Pa .cvsrc
from the home directory of the user who invoked it.
This file is used to specify implicit options passed to
.Nm
or one of its commands whenever it is invoked.
See
.Xr cvsrc 5
for further information.
.Pp
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width "-e editorXX"
.It Fl d Ar root
Use
.Ar root
as the path to the root directory of the CVS repository.
The value must specify an absolute path.
.It Fl e Ar editor
Use the program
.Ar editor
whenever editing log information.
This option overrides the environment variables CVSEDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR.
.It Fl f
Do not read the user's configuration file on startup.
.It Fl l
Suppress logging of history information.
.It Fl Q
Be extra quiet.
Only error messages will be displayed.
.It Fl q
Be quiet about reporting.
.It Fl s Ar var Ns = Ns Ar val
Set the value of the internal variable
.Ar var
to the string
.Ar val .
.It Fl t
Trace program execution.
.It Fl v
Display version information and exit.
.It Fl z Ar level
Specify the compression level to
.Xr gzip 1
when transferring files.
The compression level ranges from 1 to 9,
with 1 being the fastest,
and 9 providing the best level of compression.
The default is 6.
.El
.Sh COMMANDS
The following commands are supported by
.Nm .
.Bl -tag -width "xxxxxxxxxxxx"
.It Xo Ic add Op Fl m Ar msg
.Ar file Op ...
.Xc
.Pp
Before a file is known to CVS, it must be added to the repository using
this command.
Adding a file does not actually publish the contents of the
file, so you must
.Ic commit
the first revision in order to let other users see the file with the
.Ic update
or
.Ic checkout
commands.
.Pp
Although adding a file does not involve a log message, it is possible to
specify one to include with the action, using the
.Fl m
option.
.Pp
Aliases:
.Ic ad ,
.Ic new .
.It Ic admin
Administration front-end for
.Xr rcs 1 .
.Pp
Aliases:
.Ic adm ,
.Ic rcs .
.It Xo Ic annotate
.Op Fl flR
.Oo Fl D Ar date \*(Ba
.Fl r Ar rev Oc
.Op Ar file ...
.Xc
.Pp
For each line of any files specified, show information about its
last revision.
The information given is the last revision when a modification occurred,
the author's name, and the date of the revision.
.Pp
The
.Fl f
flag is used to force the use of the head revision if the specified
tag or date is not found.
This can be used in combination with
.Fl D
or
.Fl r
to ensure that there is some output from the
.Ic annotate
command, even if only to show Revision 1.1 of the file.
The
.Fl l
flag is used to limit the scope of the search to the local directory
only and to disable recursive behaviour, which can be requested with the
.Fl R
flag.
The
.Fl D
flag shows the annotations as of the latest revision no later than
.Ar date .
The
.Fl r
flag shows annotations as of revision
.Ar rev
(can be a revision number or a tag).
.Pp
Aliases:
.Ic ann .
.It Xo Ic checkout
.Op Fl c
.Op Ar module ...
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Ic checkout
command is used to create a local copy of one or more modules present on the
target CVS repository.
.Pp
Aliases:
.Ic co ,
.Ic get .
.It Xo Ic commit
.Op Fl flnR
.Op Fl F Ar logfile
.Op Fl m Ar msg
.Op Fl r Ar rev
.Op Ar file ...

.Pp
The
.Ic commit
command is used to send local changes back to the server and update the
repository's information to reflect the changes.
.Pp
Aliases:
.Ic ci ,
.Ic com .
.It Xo Ic diff Op Fl cilNpu
.Op Fl D Ar date
.Op Fl r Ar rev
.Op Ar file ...
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Ic diff
command is very similar to the
.Xr diff 1
program, except that the differential comparisons that it generates are
between local or remote revisions of files stored in the CVS repository.
.Pp
Aliases:
.Ic di ,
.Ic dif .
.It Ic edit
Get ready to edit a watched file.
.It Ic editors
See who is editing a watched file.

.It Xo Ic import
.Op Fl b Ar branch
.Op Fl m Ar msg
.Ar repository
.Ar vendortag
.Ar releasetag
.Xc
.Pp
Import sources into CVS using vendor branches.
.Pp
The
.Fl b
flag specifies the first-level branch number.
The
.Fl m
flag specifies the log message to send.
.Pp
At least three arguments are required:
.Ar repository
specifies the location of the sources to be imported;
.Ar vendortag
is a tag for the entire branch;
.Ar releasetag
is used to identify the files you created with
.Nm
.Ic import .
.Pp
Aliases:
.Ic im ,
.Ic imp .
.It Ic init
Create a CVS repository if it doesn't exist.
.It Ic kserver
Start a Kerberos authentication server.

.Pp
Aliases:
.Ic lo .
.It Ic login
Prompt for password for authenticating server.
.It Ic logout

.It Ic rdiff
Create
.Xr patch 1
format diffs between releases.
.It Ic release
Indicate that a module is no longer in use.
.It Xo Ic remove
.Op Fl flR
.Op Ar file ...
.Xc
The
.Ic remove
command is used to inform
.Nm
that
.Ar file
is scheduled to be removed from the repository.
Files are not actually removed from the repository until the
.Ic commit
command has been run subsequently.
.Pp
Aliases:
.Ic rm ,
.Ic delete .
.It Ic rlog

.It Xo Ic status
.Op Fl lRv
.Op Ar file ...
.Xc
The
.Ic status
command is used to display the state of checked out files.
.Pp
The
.Fl l
flag is used to limit the scope of the search to the local directory
only and to disable recursive behaviour, which can be requested with the
.Fl R
flag.
The
.Fl v
flag causes the symbolic tags for the file to be displayed.
.Pp
The following are the different possible states:
.Bl -tag -width "Unresolved ConflictXX"
.It Cm Locally Added
The file has been added with the
.Ic add
command, but has not been committed to the repository with the
.Ic commit
command.
.It Cm Locally Modified
The file is up to date, but has been locally modified since then.
.It Cm Locally Removed
The file has been removed with the
.Ic remove
command, but has not been committed to the repository with the
.Ic commit
command.
.It Cm Needs Checkout
The file has not been modified; a new version is available.
.It Cm Needs Merge
The file has been modified and a newer version is available.
A merge is necessary.
.It Cm Needs Patch
Same as
.Ic Needs Checkout
but, in client-server mode, only the differences are sent to save
network resources.
.It Cm Unresolved Conflict
A merge has been done, but unresolved conflicts still remain.
.It Cm Up-to-date
The file is up to date.
.El
.Pp

.Ic st ,
.Ic stat .
.It Xo Ic tag
.Op Fl bdl
.Op Fl r Ar old_tag
.Op Ar symbolic_tag
.Op Ar file ...
.Xc
.Pp
Add a symbolic tag to a checked out version of
.Ar file .
.Pp
The
.Fl b
flag is used to specify a branch tag.
If the
.Fl d
flag is specified the tag will be deleted.
The
.Fl l
flag is used to specify a local change only and disables the recursive
behaviour.
If the
.Fl r
flag is used,
.Nm
will only tag the files with
.Ar symbolic_tag
if they are already tagged with
.Ar old_tag .
When done, it will remove the old tag
leaving only the new tag behind on exactly the same files.
.Pp
Aliases:

.Ic edit
command.
.It Xo Ic update
.Op Fl ACdP
.Op Ar file ...
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Ic update

repository into the local one where the command was run.
.Pp
The
.Fl A
flag resets any sticky tags, dates, or kopts that have been set on the tree.
The
.Fl l
flag is used to specify a local change only and disables the recursive
behaviour.
The
.Fl P
flag causes
.Nm
to prune any directories that have become empty as a result of the update.
.Pp
Aliases:
.Ic up ,
.Ic upd .
.It Ic version
Causes
.Nm
to print its version information.
If this command is issued within a local copy of a remote repository or
if either the
.Ev CVSROOT
environment variable or the
.Fl d
flag specify a remote repository,
.Nm
will also connect to the server and ask it to print its version information.
.Pp
Aliases:
.Ic ve ,
.Ic ver .
.It Ic watch
Set watches.
.It Ic watchers
See who is watching a file.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width CVS_CLIENT_LOG
.It Ev CVS_CLIENT_LOG
This variable enables logging of all communications between the client and
server when running in non-local mode.
If set, this environment variable must contain a base path from which two
paths will be generated by appending ".in" to the value for the server's
input and ".out" for the server's output.
.It Ev CVS_RSH
Name of the program to use when connecting to the server through a remote
shell.
The default is to use the
.Xr ssh 1
program.
.It Ev CVS_SERVER
If set, gives the name of the program to invoke as a
.Nm
server when using remote shell.
The default is to use `cvs'.
.It Ev CVSEDITOR
Name of the editor to use when editing commit messages.
Checked before
.Ev EDITOR
and
.Ev VISUAL .
.It Ev CVSROOT
When set, this variable should contain the string pointing to the root
directory of the CVS repository.
The contents of this variable are ignored when the
.Fl d
option is given or if `Root' files exist in the checked-out copy.
.It Ev EDITOR
Name of the editor to use when editing commit messages.
This is traditionally a line-oriented editor,
such as
.Xr ex 1 .
.It Ev VISUAL
Name of the editor to use when editing commit messages.
This is traditionally a screen-oriented editor,
such as
.Xr vi 1 .
.El

.Sh HISTORY
The OpenCVS project is a BSD-licensed rewrite of the original
Concurrent Versioning System written by Jean-Francois Brousseau.
The original CVS code was written in large parts by Dick Grune,
Brian Berliner and Jeff Polk.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Jean-Francois Brousseau
.An Vincent Labrecque
.An Joris Vink
.Sh CAVEATS
This CVS implementation does not fully conform to the GNU CVS version.
In some cases, this was done explicitly because GNU CVS has inconsistencies
or ambiguous behaviour.
Some things have also been left out or modified to enhance the overall
security of the system.
.Pp
Among other things, support for the pserver connection mechanism has been
dropped because of security issues with the authentication mechanism.
