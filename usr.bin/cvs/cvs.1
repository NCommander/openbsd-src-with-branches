.Nm cvs
.Nd OpenCVS Concurrent Versioning System client
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Op Fl e Ar editor
.Xo
.Oo Fl s
.Ar var Ns = Ns Ar val Oc
.Xc
.Op Fl z Ar level
.Ar command Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program acts as both client and server for the use of and administration of
a CVS source repository.
CVS is used to maintain version information on files that are kept in a
repository.
Although it is more commonly used to track changes in source code, there
are no real limitations to the type of files that you can store in a
repository.
For a general introduction to CVS, see
.Xr cvsintro 7 .
.Pp
.Nm
reads its startup configuration file,
.Pa .cvsrc ,
from the home directory of the user who invoked it.
This file is used to specify implicit options passed to
.Nm
or one of its commands whenever it is invoked.
The defaults in the configuration file can be overridden with the
.Fl f
option (see below).
See
.Xr cvsrc 5
for further information.
.Pp
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width "-e editorXX"
.It Fl d Ar root
Use
.Ar root
as the path to the root directory of the CVS repository.
The value must specify an absolute path.
.It Fl e Ar editor
Use the program
.Ar editor
whenever editing log information.
This option overrides the environment variables CVSEDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR.
.It Fl f
Do not read the user's configuration file on startup.
.It Fl l
Suppress logging of history information.
.It Fl Q
Be extra quiet.
Only error messages will be displayed.
.It Fl q
Be quiet about reporting.
.It Fl s Ar var Ns = Ns Ar val
Set the value of the internal variable
.Ar var
to the string
.Ar val .
.It Fl t
Trace program execution.
.It Fl v
Display version information and exit.
.It Fl z Ar level
Specify the compression level to
.Xr gzip 1
when transferring files.
The compression level ranges from 1 to 9,
with 1 being the fastest,
and 9 providing the best level of compression.
The default is 6.
.El
.Sh COMMANDS
The following commands are supported by
.Nm .
.Bl -tag -width "xxxxxxxxxxxx"
.It Xo Ic add
.Op Fl k Ar mode
.Op Fl m Ar msg
.Ar file ...
.Xc
.Pp
Before a file is known to
.Nm ,
it must be added to the repository using this command.
Adding a file does not actually publish the contents of the
file: the
.Ic commit
command must also be used to publish it into the repository,
and thus let others access the file.
.Pp
Note: since directories have no versioning system, it is sufficient
to add them with the
.Ic add
command alone; the
.Ic commit
command is not necessary.
.Pp
The
.Ic add
command takes the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset 3n
.It Fl k Ar mode
Specify the keyword substitution mode.
.It Fl m Ar msg
Attach log message
.Ar msg .
By default, no log message is required.
.El
.Pp
Aliases:
.Ic ad ,
.Ic new .
.It Ic admin
Administration front-end for
.Xr rcs 1 .
.Pp
Aliases:
.Ic adm ,
.Ic rcs .
.It Xo Ic annotate
.Op Fl flR
.Oo Fl D Ar date \*(Ba
.Fl r Ar rev Oc
.Op Ar file ...
.Xc
.Pp
For each line of any files specified, show information about its
last revision.
The information given is the last revision when a modification occurred,
the author's name, and the date of the revision.
.Pp
The
.Ic annotate
command takes the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset 3n
.It Fl D Ar date
Show the annotations as of the latest revision no later than
.Ar date .
.It Fl f
Force the use of the head revision if the specified
tag or date is not found.
This can be used in combination with
.Fl D
or
.Fl r
to ensure that there is some output from the
.Ic annotate
command, even if only to show Revision 1.1 of the file.
.It Fl l
Limit the scope of the search to the local directory
only and disable recursive behaviour.
.It Fl R
Enable recursive behaviour.
This is the default.
.It Fl r Ar rev
Show annotations as of revision
.Ar rev
(can be a revision number or a tag).
.El

.Ar module .
.It Fl f
Force the use of the head revision if the specified
tag or date is not found.
.It Fl j Ar rev
Merge in changes made between current revision and
.Ar rev .
If two
.Fl j
options are specified, only merge the differences between the two
revisions of the branch.
This allows successive merges without having to resolve
already resolved conflicts again.
.It Fl k Ar mode
Specify the keyword substitution mode (is sticky).
.It Fl l
Limit the scope of the search to the local directory
only and disable recursive behaviour.
.It Fl N
If used in conjunction with the

.It Fl m Ar msg
Specify a log message on the command line (suppresses the editor invocation).
.It Fl n
Do not execute programs listed in the
.Pa CVSROOT/modules
file.
.It Fl R
Enable recursive behaviour.
This is the default.
.It Fl r Ar rev
Commit to a particular symbolic or numerical revision.
.El
.Pp
Aliases:
.Ic ci ,
.Ic com .
.It Xo Ic diff Op Fl cilNpu
.Op Fl D Ar date
.Op Fl r Ar rev
.Op Ar file ...
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Ic diff
command is very similar to the
.Xr diff 1
program, except that the differential comparisons that it generates are
between local or remote revisions of files stored in the CVS repository.
.Pp
Aliases:
.Ic di ,
.Ic dif .
.It Xo Ic edit Op Fl lR
.Op Fl a Ar action
.Op Ar file ...
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Ic edit
command is used to make a file that is being watched
(and therefore read-only)
readable and writable and to inform others that you are planning to edit it.
Notifications terminate when the
.Ic commit
command is issued.
Editing rights on the file can be given up using the
.Ic unedit
command, which terminates the temporary notifications.
.Pp
The
.Ic edit
command takes the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset 3n
.It Fl a Ar action
Specify the temporary notification wanted:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "commitXX" -compact
.It Cm commit
Another user has committed changes to the file.
.It Cm edit
Another user has issued the
.Ic edit
command on the file.
.It Cm unedit
Another user has issued the
.Ic unedit
command on the file.
.It Cm all
All of the above.
.It Cm none
None of the above.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl a
flag may appear more than once, or not at all.
If omitted, the action defaults to
.Cm all .
.It Fl l
Limit the scope of the search to the local directory
only and disable recursive behaviour.
.It Fl R
Enable recursive behaviour.
This is the default.
.El
.It Xo Ic editors
.Op Fl lR
.Op Ar file ...
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Ic editors
command lists the users with edition rights on a file.
For that, pseudo-lock mode must be enabled (see the
.Ic watch
command).
The e-mail address of the user editing the file, the timestamp
when the edition first started, the host from where the edition
has been requested and the path to the edited file are listed.
.Pp
The
.Ic editors
command takes the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset 3n
.It Fl l
Limit the scope of the search to the local directory
only and disable recursive behaviour.
.It Fl R
Enable recursive behaviour.
This is the default.
.El
.It Xo Ic export
.Op Fl flNnR
.Op Fl d Ar dir
.Op Fl k Ar mode
.Fl D Ar date \*(Ba
.Fl r Ar rev
.Ar module ...
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Ic export
command extracts a copy of
.Ar module
without including the directories used for management by
.Nm .
This eases production of a software release.
A date or a revision must be specified for the command to be valid,
which ensures that later extractions can be reproduced with the same
options as the release.
.Pp
The checked out module's files will be placed in a directory
bearing the same name as the checked out module, by default.
.Pp
The
.Ic export
command takes the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset 3n
.It Fl D Ar date
Export as of the latest revision no later than
.Ar date .
.It Fl d Ar dir
Export in directory
.Ar dir
instead of the directory bearing the same name as the
.Ar module .
.It Fl f
Force the use of the head revision if the specified
tag or date is not found.
This can be used in combination with
.Fl D
or
.Fl r
to ensure that the
.Ic export
command is valid.
.It Fl k Ar mode
Specify the keyword substitution mode: the
.Fl k Ar v
option is often used to avoid substitution of keywords during
a release cycle.
However, be aware that it does not handle an export containing
binary files correctly.
.It Fl l
Limit the scope of the search to the local directory
only and disable recursive behaviour.
.It Fl N
If used in conjunction with the
.Fl d
option, files are placed in local directory
.Ar module ,
located in directory
.Ar dir .
.It Fl n
Do not execute programs listed in the
.Pa CVSROOT/modules
file.
.It Fl R
Enable recursive behaviour.
This is the default.
.It Fl r Ar rev

.Op Fl m Ar msg
.Ar repository
.Ar vendortag
.Ar releasetag
.Xc
.Pp
Import sources into CVS using vendor branches.
.Pp
At least three arguments are required:
.Ar repository
specifies the location of the sources to be imported;
.Ar vendortag
is a tag for the entire branch;
.Ar releasetag
is used to identify the files you created with
.Ic cvs import .
.Pp
The
.Ic import
command takes the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset 3n
.It Fl b Ar branch
Specify the first-level branch number.

.Pa .cvspass
for a remote repository.
.It Ic rdiff
Create
.Xr patch 1
format diffs between releases.
.It Xo Ic release
.Op Fl d
.Ar dir ...
.Xc
The
.Ic release
command indicates to
.Nm
that the working copy of a module is no longer in use and checks
that non archived modifications in the base repository do exist.
This command is not mandatory.
Local directories could always be removed without using it, but
in this case the handling of history information will no longer be
correct (see the
.Ic history
command).
.Pp
The
.Ic release
command takes the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset 3n
.It Fl d Ar dir
Remove the directory
.Ar dir .
Be aware that this option silently removes any directories that have
been added to the local working copy without using the
.Ic add
command.
.El
.Pp
For each file not being synchronized with the base repository,
a single letter prefix is given to specify the state of the file.
The possible prefixes are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "XXX"
.It \&?
The file is unknown to
.Nm
and is not in the list of files to ignore.
Any new directories which have not been added with the
.Ic add
command are silently ignored as well as their content.
.It A
The file has been added with the
.Ic add
command, but has not been committed to the repository with the
.Ic commit
command.
.It M
The file has been locally modified; a more recent version might
exist in the base repository.
.It R
The file has been removed with the
.Ic remove
command, but has not been committed to the repository with the
.Ic commit
command.
.It U
A more recent version of the file does exist but it is not
locally up to date.
.El
.Pp
Aliases:
.Ic re ,
.Ic rel .
.It Xo Ic remove
.Op Fl flR
.Op Ar file ...
.Xc
The
.Ic remove
command is used to inform
.Nm
that
.Ar file
is scheduled to be removed from the repository.
Files are not actually removed from the repository until the
.Ic commit
command has been run subsequently.
.Pp
The
.Ic remove
command takes the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset 3n
.It Fl f
Force local file removal.
If this flag is not used, the file must be locally removed beforehand for
the command to be valid.
.It Fl l
Limit the scope of the search to the local directory
only and disable recursive behaviour.
.It Fl R
Enable recursive behaviour.
This is the default.
.El
.Pp
Aliases:

.Pp
The state may be one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width "Locally modified"
.It Cm Locally Added
The file has been added with the
.Ic add
command, but has not been committed to the repository with the
.Ic commit
command.
.It Cm Locally Modified
The file is up to date, but has been locally modified.
.It Cm Locally Removed
The file has been removed with the
.Ic remove
command, but has not been committed to the repository with the
.Ic commit
command.
.It Cm Needs Checkout
The file has not been modified; a new version is available.
.It Cm Needs Merge
The file has been modified and a newer version is available.
.It Cm Needs Patch
Same as
.Ic Needs Checkout
but, in client-server mode, only the differences are sent to save
network resources.
.It Cm Unresolved Conflict
A merge has been done, but unresolved conflicts still remain.
.It Cm Up-to-date
The file is up to date.

.It Xo Ic unedit Op Fl lR
.Op Ar file ...
.Xc
.Pp
The
.Ic unedit
command is used to give up an edition on a file and thus cancel
the wanted temporary notifications.
If the file has been modified since the
.Ic edit
command has been issued,
.Nm
will ask if you want to go back to the previous version, and lose the
modifications done on the file, or stay in edition mode on it.
.Pp
The
.Ic unedit
command takes the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset 3n
.It Fl l
Limit the scope of the search to the local directory
only and disable recursive behaviour.

Reset any sticky tags, dates, or keyword substitution modes that
have been set on the tree.
.It Fl D Ar date
Update as of the latest revision no later than
.Ar date
(is sticky).
.It Fl d
Create any new directories.
Without this option,
.Nm
does not create any new files sitting in these new directories
added in the base repository since the last update of the working
copy, or since the last update with the
.Fl d
option.
.It Fl f
Force the use of the head revision if the specified
tag or date is not found.
.It Fl I Ar ign
Ignore files specified by
.Ar ign .
This option can be used several times on the command line.
To see all files, use the
.Fl I Ar !\&
specification.
.It Fl j Ar rev
Merge in changes made between current revision and
.Ar rev .
If two
.Fl j
options are specified, only merge the differences between the two
revisions of the branch.
This allows successive merges without having to resolve
already resolved conflicts again.
.It Fl k Ar mode
Specify the keyword substitution mode (is sticky).

Enable recursive behaviour.
This is the default.
.It Fl r Ar rev
Update from a particular revision or branch (is sticky).
.It Fl W Ar spec
Wrappers specification line.
.El
.Pp
By default, the
.Ic update
command does not create new directories; the

.Xc
.Pp
The
.Ic watch
command switches a file from normal mode to
pseudo-lock mode as well as handling the notifications associated
with it.
Pseudo-lock mode means knowing who is editing a file:
for that,
.Nm
extracts the file in read-only mode.
Users must use the
.Ic edit
command to get the editing rights on the file.
.Pp
One of the following arguments to the
.Ic watch
command is mandatory: on, off, add, or remove.
.Ar on
switches the file into pseudo-lock mode;
.Ar off
switches it back to normal mode;
.Ar add
adds notifications for specific actions on the file;
.Ar remove
removes those notifications.
.Pp
The notifications are permanent.
They remain in place until the
.Ic watch remove
command is issued while the temporary notifications are
made available with the
.Ic edit
command.
.Pp
The

.Sh CAVEATS
This CVS implementation does not fully conform to the GNU CVS version.
In some cases, this was done explicitly because GNU CVS has inconsistencies
or ambiguous behaviour.
Some things have also been left out or modified to enhance the overall
security of the system.
.Pp
Among other things, support for the pserver connection mechanism has been
dropped because of security issues with the authentication mechanism.
