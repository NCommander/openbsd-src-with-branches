.Nd CVS filters
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file, located in
.Pa $CVSROOT/CVSROOT
and/or
.Pa $HOME/.cvswrappers ,
provides a way to configure filters for
.Xr cvs 1
based on file type (name).
This works by specifying a pattern to match for varying file types.

.Pp
.Dl pattern [option 'value'] [option 'value'] ...
.Pp
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds

.Ar filter
when the file is extracted from the repository (for the

See the
.Sx KEYWORD SUBSTITUTION
section of
.Xr cvs 1
for more information.
.It Fl m Ar method
Specify the merge methodology to be used when a file is updated.

.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It COPY

.Ic update
command is used,
.Xr cvs 1
will merely copy one version over another and let the user do the merge
by himself.

option).

Try to merge the files.
This method is the default.

.It Fl t Ar filter
Execute
.Ar filter
before the file is archived in the repository (for the
