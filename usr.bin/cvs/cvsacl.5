.Nd CVS Access Control Lists format
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file format is the format understood by the

daemon for performing access control on files within the CVS repository.
It is composed of access rules, each on a single line, which either allow
or deny certain operations on files or entire directories.
.Sh GRAMMAR
The
.Nm
grammar is expressed in BNF (Backus-Naur Form) notation.
Terminals are displayed as normal text.
Nonterminals are in bold.

.Ql [
and
.Ql \&]
.Pc
is optional.
The pipe character
.Pq Ql \&|
is used to separate multiple choices.

.Nm
rules:
.Bl -tag -width "this is a test"
