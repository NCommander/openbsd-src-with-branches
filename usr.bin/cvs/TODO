OpenCVS 0.2 TODO

Missing commands
================
Implementing the missing commands is mostly a job of copying the code from
the working commands and changing some of the requests to be sent.

Specific file handling
======================
Right now, commands are only working when not specifying files on the
command line.  cvs_file_getspec() needs to be implemented to load only
a specific list of files along with the directory hierarchy for those
files.

Multiple server support
=======================
This is close to working but we need to put something like pre- and post-
recursion handlers for cvs_file_examine() so we can send one command
per root connection instead of one global command at the end.

Client-daemon protocol
======================
I have not yet given too much thought to this.  Any suggestions would be
welcome.
