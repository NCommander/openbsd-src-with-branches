OpenCVS 0.2 TODO

Missing commands
================
Implementing the missing commands is mostly a job of copying the code from
the working commands and changing some of the requests to be sent.

Multiple server support
=======================
This is close to working but we need to put something like pre- and post-
recursion handlers for cvs_file_examine() so we can send one command
per root connection instead of one global command at the end.

Client-daemon protocol
======================
I have started working on the code for this but it is far from ready.  Please
contact me if you want to work on that part.

Entries file caching
====================
Currently, adding entries in an Entries file involves opening that file,
adding the entry and closing the file.  This means that on every new entry,
the file is reparsed and rewritten to disk.  We should add some kind of
caching system with reference counts on the Entries files so we don't really
close them but keep them opened for future requests to avoid all the disk I/O.
