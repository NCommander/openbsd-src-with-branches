.Sh NAME
.Nm learn
.Nd computer based learning
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm learn 
.Op lesson
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This is a resurrection of the learn command from V7 UNIX, circa 1979.
The program works fine, but many of the lessons are quite antiquated.
It remains for others to write new lessons describing current
versions of UNIX-like systems.
.Sh FILES
.Nm /usr/libdata/learn/* 
.Nd lesson files.
.br
.Nm /tmp/pl** 
.Nd playground directory created for each invocation.
Removed at end of run.
.Sh SEE ALSO
Learn \- Computer-Aided Instruction on UNIX,
(Second Edition), Brian W. Kernighan and Michael E. Lesk.
January 30, 1979
.Pp
The version described there created the "play" directory for each
user under the lesson file directory; this version creates
a directory under /tmp for each user.
.Sh HISTORY
The program originated in Seventh Edition UNIX.
A lightly-revised version of the program was released by
Lucent/Bell Laboratories in 1997, and
modernized for OpenBSD 2.4 by Ian Darwin, who also wrote this man page,
and Paul Janzen.
.Sh BUGS
The lessons need updating. There should be lessons on awk, sed,
perl, shell, and other scripting languages.
.Pp
There is no way to drive a screen-based program such as vi or emacs.
.Pp
Could do a better job of displaying the text. Maybe curses?
Or maybe the text should be re-written in HTML?
.Pp
Perhaps the lesson file should be reorganized so that all the lessons
for each topic are in one large file instead of so many tiny ones.
