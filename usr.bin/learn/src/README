This is a historical document describing code that once
worked fine.  It sort of limps along now, but there are
some things that don't work right.  Caveat emptor.


Make a learn by
	make

When this seems right, extract the lessons by
	make lessons

This extracts the lesson archives for each course.  You can also
do this one step at a time with "make files", "make editor",
etc., if you don't want all courses.  The C script is not
complete; use at your own risk.

To set up the working directories, you must also say
	make play; make log

Finally, check that it's sensible with
	make check
If that doesn't print any messages, you're probably in good shape.

Learn requires general write permission on the user playpen
directory .../lib/play.  Lesson directories may be protected.

Learn collects a log file for each script in the .../lib/log
directory, with a file for each script (files, editor, etc.)
containing an entry for each lesson attempted.  These files will
grow without bound, unless they are periodically truncated.  The
log files should have general write permission.  If you don't
want logging (a sensible position to take), set the variable
"logging" to zero in source/lrndef before making learn.
