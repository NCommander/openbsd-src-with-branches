.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg-config
.Nd fetch metadata about installed software packages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pkg-config
.Op Ar options
.Ar pkg-name Op Ar pkg-name ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility retreives metadata about the installation of software packages.
This metadata includes version, compiler and linker flags, and dependency
information.
.Pp
Metadata is stored in files named after the package they describe; the
Yoyodyne package would likely be described by "yoyodyne.pc".
Packages controlled by the
.Xr ports 7
system store their metadata in
.Pa ${LOCALBASE}/lib/pkgconfig
and X stores its metadata in
.Pa ${X11BASE}/lib/pkgconfig.
.Pp

The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl -debug
Enable internal development and debugging messages.
.It Fl -help
Print a help message and exit.
.It Fl -usage
Print a help message and exit.
.It Fl -list-all
List all installed packages and exit.
.It Fl -version
Print version of

and exit.
.It Fl -errors-to-stdout

.It Fl -cflags
Return all compiler flags required to compile against the package.
.It Fl -cflags-only-I
Return only the include path flags required to compile against the package.
.It Fl -cflags-only-other
Return all compiler flags, other than the include path flags, required to
compile against the package.

.It Fl -libs
Return all linker flags required to linker against the package.
.It Fl -libs-only-l
Return only the library (-lwhatever) flags required to link against
the package.
.It Fl -libs-only-L
Return only the library path (-L/path/to/lib) flags required to link
against the package.
.It Fl -libs-only-other
Return linker flags, other than the library and path flags, required to
compile against the package.

.It Fl -exists
Return true if all the specified packages are installed.
.It Fl -uninstalled
Allow packages not controlled by

.It Fl -static
Return the compiler and/or linker flags required for static linking.
