.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a command-line-like interface for communicating with smartcards.   APDU's () can be sent to the card, and results are displayed.  Some commands are card-specific, and focus on the Schlumberger Cyberflex Access Javacards, as that is one of CITI's most commonly used cards.

The
.Nm
options are as follows:

     -h  watch for card removal.
.Nm
alerts user of this event

     -t	 change the ATR timeout of a card.  Many cards do not conform to the ISO specs, and use varying lengths of ATR timeouts.


The
.Nm
commands are as follows:

1/2 - number of port to which smartcard reader is attached also calls reset (and accepts same modifiers) modifers:  t -

r   - issue a reset to the card
      modifers: v - verbose
                f - force open
                i - return immediately if there is no card in the reader

C   - set the instruction class

f   - select or open a file
      options:  / - select root file (30 00)
                <byte>.<byte>
                <byte> <byte> - select file designated by
                                these two bytes

g   - stat currently selected file

?/h - display the help screen
      option: command you want help on

i/o/b - send an 'in/out/in-out' command
      requires ins, p1, p2, p3
      options: c - allows you to specify class byte

T   - send T=1 I block and get reply
      options: S - send R/S block

        l - download applet (.bin)
           options -p program FID, -c instance directory FID,
                   -s data directory size, -i data container size,
                   -a applet AID
        u - unload applet
           options -p program ID, -c instance directory FID,
                   -a applet AID
        p - select applet
                   -a applet AID
        q - select default loader as current
        k - load DES key  (Usage: jk number_of_keys)
        R - load RSA private key

s   - Sm@rt Cafe:
       l - download applet (.CAP)

R   - read file
      R filesize

W   - write file
