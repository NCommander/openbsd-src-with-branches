and breaks it up into files of 1000 lines each.

.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Create smaller files
.Ar byte_count
bytes in length.
If
.Dq Li k
is appended to the number, the file is split into
.Ar byte_count
kilobyte pieces.
If
.Dq Li m
is appended to the number, the file is split into
.Ar byte_count
megabyte pieces.
.It Fl l
Create smaller files
.Ar n
lines in length.
.El
.Pp
If additional arguments are specified, the first is used as the name
of the input file which is to be split.

prefix followed by a lexically ordered suffix in the range of 
.Dq Li aa-zz .
.Pp
If the
.Ar name
