Known bugs in sudo version 1.6.1
================================

1) "make install-man" should substitute correct paths into the
    man pages themselves.

2) Sudo should log when removing "dangerous" envariables.

3) configure variables that have been cached cannot be overridden
   in subsequent configure runs, even if other --with-* options are
   given.  This is a flaw in GNU autoconf.

4) On DUNIX in sia mode, hitting return at the prompt does not quit.

5) In parse.lex, '@" should not need to be a special character.
   For some reason, if it is not excluded from WORD, Defaults@ doesn't
   match.
