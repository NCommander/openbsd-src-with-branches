TODO list (most will be addressed in sudo 2.0)

01) Redo parsing to be more like op(8) with true command aliases where
    can specify uid, gid(s) and part/all of the environment.

02) Add default options to sudoers file (umask, def uid, def gids, dir, PATH).
    Defaults = option1, option2, ...
    Defaults@host = option1, option2, ...
    Defaults!user = option1, option2, ...
    Defaults%group = option1, option2, ...
    Defaults+netgroup = option1, option2, ...

03) Add a SHELLS reserved word that checks against /etc/shells.

04) Make the sudoers file accessible via NIS, Hesiod, and maybe NetInfo.

05) Add a -h (?) flag to sudo for a history mechanism.

06) Add an option to hard-code LD_LIBRARY_PATH?

07) Add Prog_Alias facility (Prog_Alias VI = /usr/secure/bin/vi +args).

08) check for <net/errno.h> in configure and include it in sudo.c if it exists.

09) Add generic STREAMS support for getting interfaces and netmasks.

10) Add support for "safe scripts" by checking for shell script
    cookie (first two bytes are "#!") and execing the shell outselves
    after doing the stat to guard against spoofing.  This should avoid
    the race condition caused by going through namei() twice...

11) Overhaul testsudoers to use things from parse.o so we don't reimplement
    things.

12) Make runas_user a struct "runas" with user and group components.
    (maybe uid and gid too???)

13) Add -g group/gid option.

14) Should be able to mix Cmnd_Alias's and command args.  Ie:
	pete   ALL=PASSWD [A-z]*,!PASSWD root
    where PASSWD was defined to be /usr/bin/passwd.
    This requires the arg parsing to happen in the yacc grammer.
    At the very least, commands and args have to become separate
    tokens in the lexer.

15) Add a per-tty restriction?  Ie: only can run foo from /dev/console.

16) Add test for how to read ether interfaces in configure script

17) Add configure check for $(CC) -R and use it in addition to -L

18) An option to make "sudo -s" use the target user's shell might be nice
    (and more like su).

19) Use getrlimit() in preference to getconf()/getdtablesize().

20) Add configure option to enable old behavior of visudo (O_EXCL)?
    --without-sudoers-lock?

21) Profile sudo again (is the yacc grammar optimal?)

22) Zero out encrypted passwords after use.  Use an Exit function or
    some such (have to hook in to emalloc() and friends).
    Hard (impossible?) to be thorough w/ atexit/on_exit.

23) Make 'sudo -l user' if run as root do a "sudo -l" output for the specified
    user.

24) Use strtol() and strtoul(), not atoi()

25) In parse.yacc get rid on unneeded '{ ; }'

26) Look into %e, %p, %k in parse.lex

27) Document Defaults stuff in sudoers.pod

28) Make syslog stuff work on vanilla ultrix

29) Implement date_format and log_format options.

30) Add support for: Default:user@host

31) Do login-style -sh hack for sudo -s?

32) Make visudo rcs-aware
