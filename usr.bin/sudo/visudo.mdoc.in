.Sh NAME
.Nm visudo
.Nd edit the sudoers file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm visudo
.Op Fl cqsV
.Bk -words
.Op Fl f Ar sudoers
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm visudo
edits the
.Em sudoers
file in a safe fashion, analogous to
.Xr vipw @mansectsu@ .
.Nm visudo
locks the
.Em sudoers
file against multiple simultaneous edits, provides basic sanity checks,
and checks for parse errors.
If the
.Em sudoers
file is currently being edited you will receive a message to try again later.
.Pp
There is a hard-coded list of one or more editors that
.Nm visudo
will use set at compile-time that may be overridden via the
.Em editor
.Em sudoers
.Li Default
variable.
This list defaults to
.Li "@editor@" .
Normally,
.Nm visudo
does not honor the
.Ev VISUAL
or
.Ev EDITOR
environment variables unless they contain an editor in the aforementioned
editors list.
However, if
.Nm visudo
is configured with the
.Li --with-env-editor
option or the
.Em env_editor
.Li Default
variable is set in
.Em sudoers ,
.Nm visudo
will use any the editor defines by
.Ev VISUAL
or
.Ev EDITOR .
Note that this can be a security hole since it allows the user to
execute any program they wish simply by setting
.Ev VISUAL
or
.Ev EDITOR .
.Pp
.Nm visudo
parses the
.Em sudoers
file after the edit and will
not save the changes if there is a syntax error.
Upon finding an error,
.Nm visudo
will print a message stating the line number(s)
where the error occurred and the user will receive the
.Dq What now?
prompt.
At this point the user may enter
.Ql e
to re-edit the
.Em sudoers
file,
.Ql x
to exit without saving the changes, or
.Ql Q
to quit and save changes.
The
.Ql Q
option should be used with extreme care because if
.Nm visudo
believes there to be a parse error, so will
.Nm sudo
and no one
will be able to
.Nm sudo
again until the error is fixed.
If
.Ql e
is typed to edit the
.Em sudoers
file after a parse error has been detected, the cursor will be placed on
the line where the error occurred (if the editor supports this feature).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl c
Enable
.Em check-only
mode.
The existing
.Em sudoers
file will be
checked for syntax errors, owner and mode.
A message will be printed to the standard output describing the status of
.Em sudoers
unless the
.Fl q
option was specified.
If the check completes successfully,
.Nm visudo
will exit with a value of 0.
If an error is encountered,
.Nm visudo
will exit with a value of 1.
.It Fl f Ar sudoers
Specify and alternate
.Em sudoers
file location.
With this option
.Nm visudo
will edit (or check) the
.Em sudoers
file of your choice,
instead of the default,
.Pa @sysconfdir@/sudoers .
The lock file used is the specified
.Em sudoers
file with
.Dq \.tmp
appended to it.
In
.Em check-only
mode only, the argument to
.Fl f
may be
.Ql - ,
indicating that
.Em sudoers
will be read from the standard input.
.It Fl q
Enable
.Em quiet
mode.
In this mode details about syntax errors are not printed.
This option is only useful when combined with
the
.Fl c
option.
.It Fl s
Enable
.Em strict
checking of the
.Em sudoers
file.
If an alias is used before it is defined,
.Nm visudo
will consider this a parse error.
Note that it is not possible to differentiate between an
alias and a host name or user name that consists solely of uppercase
letters, digits, and the underscore
.Pq Ql _
character.
.It Fl V
The
.Fl V ( Em version Ns No )
option causes
.Nm visudo
to print its version number
and exit.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables may be consulted depending on
the value of the
.Em editor
and
.Em env_editor
.Em sudoers
settings:
.Bl -tag -width 15n
.It Ev VISUAL
Invoked by
.Nm visudo
as the editor to use
.It Ev EDITOR
Used by
.Nm visudo
if
.Ev VISUAL
is not set
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width 24n
.It Pa @sysconfdir@/sudoers
List of who can run what
.It Pa @sysconfdir@/sudoers.tmp
Lock file for visudo
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Li sudoers file busy, try again later.
Someone else is currently editing the
.Em sudoers
file.
.It Li @sysconfdir@/sudoers.tmp: Permission denied
You didn't run
.Nm visudo
as root.
.It Li Can't find you in the passwd database
Your user ID does not appear in the system passwd file.
.It Li Warning: {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias referenced but not defined
Either you are trying to use an undeclared {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias
or you have a user or host name listed that consists solely of
uppercase letters, digits, and the underscore
.Pq Ql _
character.
In the latter case, you can ignore the warnings
.Po
.Nm sudo
will not complain
.Pc .
In
.Fl s
(strict) mode these are errors, not warnings.
.It Li Warning: unused {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias
The specified {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias was defined but never
used.
You may wish to comment out or remove the unused alias.
In
.Fl s
(strict) mode this is an error, not a warning.
.It Li Warning: cycle in {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias
The specified {User,Runas,Host,Cmnd}_Alias includes a reference to
itself, either directly or through an alias it includes.
This is only a warning by default as
.Nm sudo
will ignore cycles when parsing
the
.Em sudoers
file.
