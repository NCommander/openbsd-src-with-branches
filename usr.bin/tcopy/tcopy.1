.Sh NAME
.Nm tcopy
.Nd copy and/or verify mag tapes
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tcopy
.Op Fl cvx
.Op Fl s Ar maxblk
.Oo Ar src Op Ar dest
.Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Tcopy
is designed to copy magnetic tapes.  The only assumption made
about the tape is that there are two tape marks at the end.
.Nm Tcopy
with only a source tape
.Pf ( Ar rmt0
by default) specified will print
information about the sizes of records and tape files.  If a destination
is specified a copy will be made of the source tape.  The blocking on the
destination tape will be identical to that used on the source tape.  Copying
a tape will yield the same output as if just printing the sizes.
.Pp
Options:
.Bl -tag -width s_maxblk
.It Fl c
