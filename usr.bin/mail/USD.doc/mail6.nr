.sh 1 "Command line options"
.pp
This section describes command line options for
.i Mail
and what they are used for.
.ip "\-b list\ \ "
Send blind carbon copies to list.
.ip "\-c list\ \ "
Send carbon copies to list of users.
List should be a comma separated list of names.
.ip "\-f file\ \ "
Show the messages in
.i file
instead of your system mailbox.  If
.i file
is omitted,
.i Mail
reads
.i mbox
in your home directory.
.ip \-I
Forces mail to run in interactive mode,
even when input is not a terminal.
In particular, the special \fB~\fP command character,
used when sending mail, is only available interactively.
.ip \-i
Ignore tty interrupt signals.
This is particularly useful when using mail on noisy phone lines.
.ip \-N
Suppress the initial printing of headers.
.ip \-n
Inhibit reading of /etc/mail.rc upon startup.
.ip "\-s string"
Used for sending mail.
.i String
is used as the subject of the message being composed.  If
.i string
contains blanks, you must surround it with quote marks.
.ip "\-u name"
Read
.i names's
mail instead of your own.  Unwitting others often neglect to protect
their mailboxes, but discretion is advised. Essentially,
.b "\-u user"
is a shorthand way of doing
.b "\-f /var/mail/user".
.ip "\-v"
Use the
.b \-v
flag when invoking sendmail. This feature may also be enabled
by setting the option "verbose".
.pp
The following command line flags are also recognized, but are
intended for use by programs invoking
.i Mail
and not for people.
.ip \-d
Turn on debugging information.  Not of general interest.
.ip "\-T file"
Arrange to print on
.i file
the contents of the
.i article-id
fields of all messages that were either read or deleted.
.b \-T
is for the
.i readnews
program and should NOT be used for reading your mail.
