/*	A search path consists of a Lst of Path structures. A Path structure
 *	has in it the name of the directory and a hash table of all the files
 *	in the directory. This is used to cut down on the number of system
 *	calls necessary to find implicit dependents and their like. Since
 *	these searches are made before any actions are taken, we need not
 *	worry about the directory changing due to creation commands. If this
 *	hampers the style of some makefiles, they must be changed.
 *
 *	A list of all previously-read directories is kept in the
 *	openDirectories cache.
 *
 *	The need for the caching of whole directories is brought about by
 *	the multi-level transformation code in suff.c, which tends to search
 *	for far more files than regular make does. In the initial
 *	implementation, the amount of time spent performing "stat" calls was
 *	truly astronomical. The problem with hashing at the start is,
 *	of course, that pmake doesn't then detect changes to these directories
 *	during the course of the make. Three possibilities suggest themselves:
 *
 *	    1) just use stat to test for a file's existence. As mentioned
 *	       above, this is very inefficient due to the number of checks
 *	       engendered by the multi-level transformation code.
 *	    2) use readdir() and company to search the directories, keeping
 *	       them open between checks. I have tried this and while it
 *	       didn't slow down the process too much, it could severely
 *	       affect the amount of parallelism available as each directory
 *	       open would take another file descriptor out of play for
 *	       handling I/O for another job. Given that it is only recently
 *	       that UNIX OS's have taken to allowing more than 20 or 32
 *	       file descriptors for a process, this doesn't seem acceptable
 *	       to me.
 *	    3) record the mtime of the directory in the Path structure and
 *	       verify the directory hasn't changed since the contents were
 *	       hashed. This will catch the creation or deletion of files,
 *	       but not the updating of files. However, since it is the
 *	       creation and deletion that is the problem, this could be
 *	       a good thing to do. Unfortunately, if the directory (say ".")
 *	       were fairly large and changed fairly frequently, the constant
 *	       rehashing could seriously degrade performance. It might be
 *	       good in such cases to keep track of the number of rehashes
 *	       and if the number goes over a (small) limit, resort to using
 *	       stat in its place.
 *
 *	An additional thing to consider is that pmake is used primarily
 *	to create C programs and until recently pcc-based compilers refused
 *	to allow you to specify where the resulting object file should be
 *	placed. This forced all objects to be created in the current
 *	directory. This isn't meant as a full excuse, just an explanation of
 *	some of the reasons for the caching used here.
 *
 *	One more note: the location of a target's file is only performed
 *	on the downward traversal of the graph and then only for terminal
 *	nodes in the graph. This could be construed as wrong in some cases,
 *	but prevents inadvertent modification of files when the "installed"
 *	directory for a file is provided in the search path.
 *
 *	Another data structure maintained by this module is an mtime
 *	cache used when the searching of cached directories fails to find
 *	a file. In the past, Dir_FindFile would simply perform an access()
 *	call in such a case to determine if the file could be found using
 *	just the name given. When this hit, however, all that was gained
 *	was the knowledge that the file existed. Given that an access() is
 *	essentially a stat() without the copyout() call, and that the same
 *	filesystem overhead would have to be incurred in Dir_MTime, it made
 *	sense to replace the access() with a stat() and record the mtime
 *	in a cache for when Dir_MTime was actually called.  */
