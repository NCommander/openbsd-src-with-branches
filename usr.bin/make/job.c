/*-
 * job.c --
 *	handle the creation etc. of our child processes.
 *
 * Interface:
 *	Job_Make		Start the creation of the given target.
 *
 *	Job_CatchChildren	Check for and handle the termination of any
 *				children. This must be called reasonably
 *				frequently to keep the whole make going at
 *				a decent clip, since job table entries aren't
 *				removed until their process is caught this way.
 *				Its single argument is true if the function
 *				should block waiting for a child to terminate.
 *
 *	Job_CatchOutput 	Print any output our children have produced.
 *				Should also be called fairly frequently to
 *				keep the user informed of what's going on.
 *				If no output is waiting, it will block for
 *				a time given by the SEL_* constants, below,
 *				or until output is ready.
 *
 *	Job_Init		Called to initialize this module. in addition,
 *				any commands attached to the .BEGIN target
 *				are executed before this function returns.
 *				Hence, the makefile must have been parsed
 *				before this function is called.
 *
 *	Job_End 		Cleanup any memory used.
 *
 *	Job_Full		Return true if the job table is filled.
 *
 *	Job_Empty		Return true if the job table is completely
 *				empty.
 *
 *	Job_Finish		Perform any final processing which needs doing.
 *				This includes the execution of any commands
 *				which have been/were attached to the .END
 *				target. It should only be called when the
 *				job table is empty.
 *
 *	Job_AbortAll		Abort all currently running jobs. It doesn't
 *				handle output or do anything for the jobs,
 *				just kills them. It should only be called in
 *				an emergency, as it were.
 *
 *	Job_Wait		Wait for all currently-running jobs to finish.

 * Job Table definitions.
 *
 * Each job has several things associated with it:
 *	1) The process id of the child shell
 *	2) The graph node describing the target being made by this job
 *	3) A LstNode for the first command to be saved after the job
 *	   completes. This is NULL if there was no "..." in the job's
 *	   commands.
 *	4) An FILE* for writing out the commands. This is only
 *	   used before the job is actually started.
 *	5) A union of things used for handling the shell's output. Different
 *	   parts of the union are used based on the value of the usePipes
 *	   flag. If it is true, the output is being caught via a pipe and
 *	   the descriptors of our pipe, an array in which output is line
 *	   buffered and the current position in that buffer are all
 *	   maintained for each job. If, on the other hand, usePipes is false,
 *	   the output is routed to a temporary file and all that is kept
 *	   is the name of the file and the descriptor open to the file.
 *	6) An identifier provided by and for the exclusive use of the
 *	   Rmt module.
 *	7) A word of flags which determine how the module handles errors,
 *	   echoing, etc. for the job
 *
 * The job "table" is kept as a linked Lst in 'jobs', with the number of
 * active jobs maintained in the 'nJobs' variable. At no time will this
 * exceed the value of 'maxJobs', initialized by the Job_Init function.
 *
 * When a job is finished, the Make_Update function is called on each of the
 * parents of the node which was just remade. This takes care of the upward
 * traversal of the dependency graph.
