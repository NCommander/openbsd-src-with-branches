 * job.c --
 *	handle the creation etc. of our child processes.
 *
 * Interface:
 *	Job_Make		Start the creation of the given target.
 *
 *	Job_CatchChildren	Check for and handle the termination of any
 *				children. This must be called reasonably
 *				frequently to keep the whole make going at
 *				a decent clip, since job table entries aren't
 *				removed until their process is caught this way.
 *
 *	Job_CatchOutput 	Print any output our children have produced.
 *				Should also be called fairly frequently to
 *				keep the user informed of what's going on.
 *				If no output is waiting, it will block for
 *				a time given by the SEL_* constants, below,
 *				or until output is ready.
 *
 *	Job_Init		Called to initialize this module. in addition,
 *				any commands attached to the .BEGIN target
 *				are executed before this function returns.
 *				Hence, the makefile must have been parsed
 *				before this function is called.
 *
 *	Job_End 		Cleanup any memory used.
 *
 *	Job_Full		Return true if the job table is filled.
 *
 *	Job_Empty		Return true if the job table is completely
 *				empty.
 *
 *	Job_Finish		Perform any final processing which needs doing.
 *				This includes the execution of any commands
 *				which have been/were attached to the .END
 *				target. It should only be called when the
 *				job table is empty.
 *
 *	Job_AbortAll		Abort all currently running jobs. It doesn't
 *				handle output or do anything for the jobs,
 *				just kills them. It should only be called in
 *				an emergency, as it were.
 *
 *	Job_Wait		Wait for all currently-running jobs to finish.

 *
 * The job "table" is kept as a linked Lst in 'jobs', with the number of
