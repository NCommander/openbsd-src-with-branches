.Sh NAME
.Nm locale
.Nd character encoding and localization conventions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm locale
.Op Fl a | Fl m | Cm charmap
.Sh DESCRIPTION
If the
.Nm
utility is invoked without any arguments, the current locale
configuration is shown.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width charmap
.It Fl a
Display a list of supported locales.
.It Fl m
Display a list of supported character encodings.
On
.Ox ,
this always returns UTF-8 only.
.It Cm charmap
Display the currently selected character encoding.
On
.Ox ,
this returns either US-ASCII or UTF-8.
.El
.Pp
A locale is a set of environment variables telling programs which
character encoding, language and cultural conventions the user
prefers.
Programs in the
.Ox
base system ignore the locale except for the character encoding,
and it is not recommended to use any of these variables except that
the following non-default setting is supported as an option:
.Pp
.Dl export LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8
.Pp
Programs installed from
.Xr packages 7
may or may not change behavior according to the locale.
Many programs use the X/Open System Interfaces naming scheme
for the contents of the variables listed below, which is
.Sm off
.Ar language
.Op _ Ar TERRITORY
.Op \&. Ar encoding
.Op @ Ar modifier
.Sm on
.Pp
The behavior of some library functions may also depend on the locale,
and it does on most other operating systems.
The
.Ox
C library tends to avoid locale-dependent behavior except with
respect to character encoding.
See the manual pages of individual functions for details.
.Pp
The character encoding locale
.Ev LC_CTYPE
instructs programs which character encoding to assume for text input
and to use for text output.
A character encoding maps each character of a given character set
to a byte sequence suitable for storing or transmitting the character.
.Pp
The
.Ox
base system supports two locales: the default of
.Li LC_CTYPE=C
selects the US-ASCII character set and encoding, treating the bytes
0x80 to 0xff as non-printable characters of application-specific
meaning.
.Li LC_CTYPE=POSIX
is an alias for
.Li LC_CTYPE=C .
The alternative of
.Li LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8
selects the UTF-8 encoding of the Unicode character set, which is
supported by many parts of the system, but not yet fully supported
by all parts.
.Pp
If the value of
.Ev LC_CTYPE
ends in
.Ql .UTF-8 ,
programs in the
.Ox
base system ignore the beginning of it, treating for example zh_CN.UTF-8
exactly like en_US.UTF-8.
Programs from
.Xr packages 7
may however make a difference.
If the value of
.Ev LC_CTYPE
is unsupported, programs and libraries in the
.Ox
base systems fall back to
.Li LC_CTYPE=C .
.Pp
Some programs, for example
.Xr write 1 ,
deliberately ignore the locale and always use US-ASCII only.
See the manual pages of individual programs for details.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The locale configuration consists of the following environment variables:
.Bl -tag -width LC_MONETARYX
.It Ev LC_ALL
Overrides all other
.Ev LC_*
variables below.
.It Ev LC_COLLATE
Intended to affect collation order.
It may for example affect alphabetic sorting, regular expressions
including equivalence classes, and the
.Xr strcoll 3
and
.Xr strxfrm 3
functions.
.It Ev LC_CTYPE
Intended to affect character encoding, character classification,
and case conversion.
For example, it is used by
.Xr mbtowc 3 ,
.Xr iswctype 3 ,
.Xr iswalnum 3 ,
.Xr towlower 3 ,
.Xr fgetwc 3 ,
.Xr fputwc 3 ,
.Xr printf 3 ,
and
.Xr scanf 3 .
.It Ev LC_MESSAGES
Intended to affect the output of informative and diagnostic messages
and the interpretation of interactive responses, in particular
regarding the language.
It is used by
.Xr catopen 3 .
.It Ev LC_MONETARY
Intended to affect monetary formatting.
.It Ev LC_NUMERIC
Intended to affect numeric, non-monetary formatting, for example
the radix character and thousands separators.
On other operating systems, it may for example affect
.Xr printf 3 ,
.Xr scanf 3 ,
and
.Xr strtod 3 .
.It Ev LC_TIME
Intended to affect date and time formats.
It may for example affect
.Xr strftime 3 .
.It Ev LANG
Fallback if any of the above is unset.
.It Ev NLSPATH
Used by
.Xr catopen 3
to locate message catalogs.

.Sh STANDARDS
With respect to locale support, most libraries and programs in the
.Ox
base system, including the
.Nm
utility, implement a subset of the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility was first standardized in the
.St -xpg4 .
.Pp
It was rewritten from scratch for
.Ox 5.4
during the 2013 Toronto hackathon.

.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
concept is inadequate for inter-process communication.
Two processes exchanging text, for example over a network, using
sockets, in shared memory, or even using plain text files always
need a protocol-specific way to negotiate the character encoding
used.
.Pp
The list of supported locales is perpetually incomplete.
