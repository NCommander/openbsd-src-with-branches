.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file(s) are moved (or copied if the
.Fl c
option is specified) to the target file or directory.
If the destination is a directory, then the
.Ar file
is moved into
.Ar directory
with its original filename.
If the target file already exists, it is overwritten if permissions
allow.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl C
Copy the file.
If the target file already exists and the files are the same,
then don't change the modification time of the target.
.It Fl c
Copy the file.  This is actually the default.  The
.Fl c
option is only included for backwards compatibility.
.It Fl d
Create directories. 
Missing parent directories are created as required.
.It Fl f
Specify the target's file flags.
(See
.Xr chflags 1
for a list of possible flags and their meanings.)
.It Fl g
Specify a group.  A numeric GID is allowed.
.It Fl m
Specify an alternate mode.
The default mode is set to rwxr-xr-x (0755).
The specified mode may be either an octal or symbolic value; see
.Xr chmod  1
for a description of possible mode values.
.It Fl o
Specify an owner.  A numeric UID is allowed.
.It Fl p
Preserve the modification time.
Copy the file, as if the
.Fl C
(Compare and copy) option is specified,
except if the target file doesn't already exist or is different,
then preserve the modification time of the file.
.It Fl S
Safe copy.  Normally,
.Nm install
unlinks an existing target before installing the new file.  With the
.Fl S
flag a temporary file is used and then renamed to be
the target.  The reason this is safer is that if the copy or
rename fails, the existing target is left untouched.
.It Fl s
.Nm Install
exec's the command
.Xr strip  1
to strip binaries so that install can be portable over a large
number of systems and binary types.
.El
.Pp
By default,
.Nm install
preserves all file flags, with the exception of the ``nodump'' flag.
.Pp
The
.Nm install
utility attempts to prevent moving a file onto itself.
.Pp
Installing
.Pa /dev/null
creates an empty file.
.Pp
Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of 1 is returned.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width INS@XXXXXX -compact
.It Pa INS@XXXXXX
If either
.Fl S
option is specified, or the
.Fl C
or
.Fl p
option is used in conjuction with the
.Fl s
option, temporary files named INS@XXXXXX,
where XXXXXX is decided by
.Xr mkstemp 3 ,
are created in the target directory.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr chflags 1 ,
.Xr chgrp 1 ,
.Xr chmod 1 ,
.Xr cp 1 ,
.Xr mv 1 ,
.Xr strip 1 ,

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm install
utility appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Fl C ,
.Fl p ,
and
.Fl S
flags are non-standard and should not relied upon for portability.
.br
Temporary files may be left in the target directory if
.Nm install
exits abnormally.
