.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file(s) are moved (or copied if the
.Fl c
option is specified) to the target file or directory.
If the destination is a directory, then the
.Ar file
is moved into
.Ar directory
with its original filename.
If the target file already exists, it is overwritten if permissions
allow.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Copy the file.
This flag turns off the default behavior of
.Nm install
where it deletes the original file after creating the target.
.It Fl f
Specify the target's file flags.
(See
.Xr chflags 1
for a list of possible flags and their meanings.)
.It Fl g
Specify a group.
.It Fl m
Specify an alternate mode.
The default mode is set to rwxr-xr-x (0755).
The specified mode may be either an octal or symbolic value; see
.Xr chmod  1
for a description of possible mode values.
.It Fl o
Specify an owner.
.It Fl s
.Nm Install
exec's the command
.Xr strip  1
to strip binaries so that install can be portable over a large
number of systems and binary types.
.It Fl d
Create directories. 
Missing parent directories are created as required.
.El
.Pp
By default,
.Nm install
preserves all file flags, with the exception of the ``nodump'' flag.
.Pp
The
.Nm install
utility attempts to prevent moving a file onto itself.
.Pp
Installing
.Pa /dev/null
creates an empty file.
.Pp
Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of 1 is returned.
