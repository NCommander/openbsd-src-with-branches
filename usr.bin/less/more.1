.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm more
.Op Fl ceisu
.Op Fl n Ar number
.Op Fl p Ar command
.Op Fl t Ar tag
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time.
It uses
.Xr terminfo 3
so it can run on a variety of terminals.
There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals.
(On a hardcopy terminal, lines which should be
printed at the top of the screen are prefixed with an up-arrow.)
If no
.Ar file
is specified, or if
.Ar file
is a single dash
.Pq Ql - ,
the standard input is used.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Normally,
.Nm
will repaint the screen by scrolling from the bottom of the screen.
If the
.Fl c
option is set, when
.Nm
needs to change the entire display, it will paint from the top line down.
.It Fl e
Normally, if displaying a single file,
.Nm
exits as soon as it reaches end-of-file.
The
.Fl e
option tells more to
exit if it reaches end-of-file twice without an intervening operation.
If the file is shorter than a single screen
.Nm
will exit at end-of-file regardless.
.It Fl i
The
.Fl i
option causes searches to ignore case; that is,
uppercase and lowercase are considered identical.
.It Fl n Ar number
The
.Fl n
option causes
.Nm
to page
.Ar number
of lines per screenful.
By default,
.Nm
will use the terminal window size.
.It Fl p Ar command
Execute the specified
.Nm
.Ar command
when the file is first opened.
.It Fl s
The
.Fl s
option causes
consecutive blank lines to be squeezed into a single blank line.
.It Fl t Ar tag
The
.Fl t
option, followed immediately by a tag, will edit the file
containing that tag.
For more information, see the
.Xr ctags  1
command.
.It Fl u
By default,
.Nm
treats backspaces and CR-LF sequences specially.
Backspaces which appear adjacent to an underscore character are
displayed as underlined text.
Backspaces which appear between two identical characters are displayed
as emboldened text.
CR-LF sequences are compressed to a single linefeed character.
The
.Fl u
option causes backspaces to always be displayed as
control characters, i.e. as the two character sequence
.Sq ^H ,
and CR-LF to be left alone.
.El
.Sh COMMANDS
Interactive commands for
.Nm
are based on
.Xr vi  1  .
Some commands may be preceded by a decimal number, called N in the
descriptions below.
In the following descriptions, ^X means control-X.
.Bl -tag -width Ic
.It Ic h
Help: display a summary of these commands.
If you forget all the other commands, remember this one.
.It Xo
.Ic SPACE
.No or
.Ic f
.No or
.Ic ^F
.Xc
Scroll forward N lines, default one window.
If N is more than the screen size, only the final screenful is displayed.
.It Ic b No or Ic ^B
Scroll backward N lines, default one window (see option -z below).
If N is more than the screen size, only the final screenful is displayed.
.It Ic j No or Ic RETURN
Scroll forward N lines, default 1.
The entire N lines are displayed, even if N is more than the screen size.
.It Ic k
Scroll backward N lines, default 1.
The entire N lines are displayed, even if N is more than the screen size.
.It Ic d No or Ic ^D
Scroll forward N lines, default one half of the screen size.
If N is specified, it becomes the new default for
subsequent d and u commands.
.It Ic u No or Ic ^U
Scroll backward N lines, default one half of the screen size.
If N is specified, it becomes the new default for
subsequent d and u commands.
.It Ic g
Go to line N in the file, default 1 (beginning of file).
.It Ic G
Go to line N in the file, default the end of the file.
.It Ic p No or Ic %
Go to a position N percent into the file.
N should be between 0 and 100.
(This works if standard input is being read, but only if
.Nm
has already read to the end of the file.
It is always fast, but not always useful.)
.It Ic r No or Ic ^L
Repaint the screen.
.It Ic R
Repaint the screen, discarding any buffered input.
Useful if the file is changing while it is being viewed.
.It Ic m
Followed by any lowercase letter,
marks the current position with that letter.
.It Ic '
(Single quote.)
Followed by any lowercase letter, returns to the position which
was previously marked with that letter.
Followed by another single quote, returns to the position at
which the last "large" movement command was executed, or the
beginning of the file if no such movements have occurred.
All marks are lost when a new file is examined.
.It Ic / Ns Ar pattern
Search forward in the file for the N-th line containing the pattern.
N defaults to 1.
The pattern is a regular expression, as recognized by
.Xr ed 1 .
The search starts at the second line displayed.
.It Ic ?\& Ns Ar pattern
Search backward in the file for the N-th line containing the pattern.
The search starts at the line immediately before the top line displayed.
.It Ic /! Ns Ar pattern
Like /, but the search is for the N-th line
which does NOT contain the pattern.
.It Ic ?! Ns Ar pattern
Like ?, but the search is for the N-th line
which does NOT contain the pattern.
.It Ic n
Repeat previous search, for N-th line containing the last pattern
(or NOT containing the last pattern,
if the previous search was /! or ?!).
.It Ic N
Repeat previous search in the opposite direction,
for N-th line containing the last pattern
(or NOT containing the last pattern,
if the previous search was /! or ?!).
.It Ic E Ns Op Ar filename
Examine a new file.
If the filename is missing, the "current" file (see the N and P commands
below) from the list of files in the command line is re-examined.
If the filename is a pound sign (#), the previously examined file is
re-examined.
.It Ic :n
Examine the next file (from the list of files given in the command line).
If a number N is specified (not to be confused with the command N),
the N-th next file is examined.
.It Ic P No or Ic :p
Examine the previous file.
If a number N is specified, the N-th previous file is examined.
.It Ic :t
Go to supplied tag.
.It Ic v
Invokes an editor to edit the current file being viewed.
The editor is taken from the environment variable
.Ev EDITOR ,
or defaults to
.Xr vi 1 .
.It Ic = No or Ic ^G
These options print out the number of the file currently being displayed
relative to the total number of files there are to display, the current
line number, the current byte number and the total bytes to display, and
what percentage of the file has been displayed.
If
.Nm
is reading from the standard input,
or the file is shorter than a single screen, some
of these items may not be available.
Note, all of these items reference the first byte of the last line
displayed on the screen.
.It Xo
.Ic q
.No or
.Ic :q
.No or
.Ic ZZ
.Xc
Exits
.Nm .
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
utilizes the following environment variables, if they exist:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Ev EDITOR
The default editor if
.Ev VISUAL
is not set.
If neither
.Ev VISUAL
nor
.Ev EDITOR
are set,
.Xr vi 1
is used.
.It Ev MORE
Default command line options to use with
.Nm .
The options should be space-separated and must be prefixed with a dash
.Pq Ql - .
.It Ev SHELL
Current shell in use (normally set by the shell at login time).
.It Ev TERM
Specifies terminal type, used by more to get the terminal
characteristics necessary to manipulate the screen.
.It Ev VISUAL
Specify default editor.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification,
though its presence is optional.
.Pp
This version of the
.Nm
utility is actually
.Xr less 1
in disguise.
As such, it will also accept options documented in
.Xr less 1 .
.Pp
Behavior for the
.Fl e
and
.Fl p
flags differs between this implementation and
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
The
.Sq s
command also has a different meaning.
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
