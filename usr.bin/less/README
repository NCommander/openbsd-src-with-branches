=======================================================================
===        NOTE: THIS IS A DISTRIBUTION OF less (version 290)       ===
===    PLEASE REPORT ANY PROBLEMS TO THE AUTHOR AT markn@3do.com.   ===
=======================================================================

This is the distribution of "less", a paginator similar to "more" or "pg".
The formatted manual page is in less.man.
The manual page nroff source is in less.nro.
Major changes made since the last posted version are in NEWS.

=======================================================================
INSTALLATION (Unix systems only):

1. Move the distributed source to its own directory and 
   unpack it by running "sh" or "unshar" on the distribution 
   files, if you have not already done so.

2. Type "sh configure".
   This will generate a Makefile and a defines.h.
   Warning: if you have a GNU sed, make sure it is version 2.05 or later.

3. It is a good idea to look over the generated Makefile and defines.h
   and make sure they look ok.  If you know of any peculiarities of
   your system that configure might not have detected, you may fix the
   Makefile now.  

   If you wish, you may edit defines.h to remove some optional features.
   If you wish to build a "secure" version of less (which disables all
   features which might allow a user to do unintended things to the system
   on which less is running), edit defines.h and define SECURE to 1.
   If you choose not to include some features in your version, you may
   wish to edit the manual page "less.nro" and the help page "less.hlp" 
   to remove the descriptions of the features which you are removing.

4. Type "make" and watch the fun.

   If you want less to find the help file in a directory other than
   the default (/usr/local/share), define "datadir" to that directory.
   For example: "make datadir=/usr/local/helpfiles"

5. If the make succeeds, it will generate a program "less"
   in your current directory.  Test the generated program.

6. When satisfied that it works, if you wish to install it
   in a public place, type "make install".

   The default install destinations are:
	Executables (less, lesskey) in /usr/local/bin
	Data files (less.hlp) in /usr/local/share
	Documentation (less.nro, lesskey.nro) in /usr/local/man/man1
   If you want to install any of these files elsewhere, define
   bindir, datadir, and/or mandir to the appropriate directories.
   datadir must be defined the same as in step 4.

If you have any problems building or running "less", suggestions, 
complaints, etc., you may mail to the author at markn@3do.com

Note to hackers: comments noting possible improvements are enclosed
in double curly brackets {{ like this }}.



=======================================================================
INSTALLATION (MS-DOS systems only)

1. Move the distributed source to its own directory.
   Make sure the source has been converted to have CR-LF rather than 
   LF as line terminators.

2. Rename MAKEFILE.DOS to MAKEFILE.

3. Look at MAKEFILE to make sure that the definitions for CC and LIBDIR
   are correct.  CC should be the name of your Microsoft C compiler and
   LIBDIR should be the directory where the Microsoft C libraries
   reside.  If these definitions need to be changed, you can either 
   modify the definitions directly in MAKEFILE, or set your environment 
   variables CC and/or LIBDIR to override the definitions in MAKEFILE.

4. If you wish, you may edit DEFINES.DOS to remove some optional features.
   If you choose not to include some features in your version, you may
   wish to edit the manual page LESS.MAN and the help page LESS.HLP 
   to remove the descriptions of the features which you are removing.

5. Type "make" and watch the fun.
   You may need to invoke "make -e", if your "make" requires the -e
   flag to import environment variables.
   If your compiler runs out of memory, try running "make -n >cmds.bat" 
   and then run cmds.bat.

6. If the make succeeds, it will generate a program "LESS.EXE"
   in your current directory.  Test the generated program.

7. When satisfied that it works, you may wish to install LESS.EXE,
   LESSKEY.EXE and LESS.HLP in a directory which is included in 
   your PATH.



=======================================================================
INSTALLATION (OS/2 systems only)

1. Move the distributed source to its own directory.

2. Rename Makefile.os2 to Makefile.

3. Check the Makefile to make sure the definitions look ok.

4. If you wish, you may edit defines.os2 to remove some optional features.
   If you choose not to include some features in your version, you may
   wish to edit the manual page less.man and the help page less.hlp
   to remove the descriptions of the features which you are removing.

5. Type "make" and watch the fun.

6. If the make succeeds, it will generate a program "less.exe"
   in your current directory.  Test the generated program.

7. Make sure you have the emx runtime installed. You need the emx DLLs
   emx.dll and emxlibcs.dll and also the termcap database, termcap.dat.
   Make sure you have termcap.dat either in the default location or
   somewhere in a directory listed in the PATH or INIT environment 
   variables.

8. When satisfied that it works, you may wish to install less.exe,
   lesskey.exe and less.hlp in a directory which is included in 
   your PATH.
