.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a small tool that performs throughput benchmarking and concurrent
sampling of kernel network variables.
.Pp
.Nm
is run as a client/server pair.
The server must be invoked with the
.Fl s
flag, which will cause it to listen for incoming connections.
The client must be invoked with the
.Ar hostname
of a listening server to connect to.
.Pp
Once connected, the client will send TCP traffic as fast as possible to
the server.
Both the client and server will periodically display throughput
statistics along with any kernel variables the user has selected to
sample (using the
.Fl k
option).
A list of available kernel variables may be obtained using the
.Fl l
option.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl B Ar buf
Specify the size of the internal write buffer used by
.Nm .
.It Fl k Ar kvars
Specify one or more kernel variables to monitor; multiple variables must be
separated with commas.
The default is not to monitor any variables.
.It Fl l
List the name of kernel variables available for monitoring and exit.
.It Fl n Ar connections
Use given number of tcp connections (default: 1).
.It Fl p Ar port
Specify the port used for the TCP test stream (default: 12345).
.It Fl r Ar rate
Specify the statistics reporting rate in milliseconds (default: 1000).
.It Fl S Ar space
Set the size of the socket buffer used for the TCP test stream.
On the client this option will resize the send buffer;
on the server it will resize the receive buffer.
.It Fl s
Place
.Nm
in server mode, where it will listen on all interfaces for incoming
connections.
.It Fl v
Display verbose output.
If specified more than once, increase the detail of information displayed.
