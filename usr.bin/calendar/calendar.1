.Sh NAME
.Nm calendar
.Nd reminder service
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm calendar
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl A Ar num
.Op Fl b
.Op Fl B Ar num
.Op Fl f Ar calendarfile
.Op Fl t Ar [[[cc]yy][mm]]dd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility checks the current directory or the directory specified by the
.Ev CALENDAR_DIR
environment variable for a file named
.Pa calendar
and displays lines that begin with either today's date
or tomorrow's.
On Fridays, events on Friday through Monday are displayed.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Process the
.Dq calendar
files of all users and mail the results
to them.
This requires superuser privileges.
.It Fl A Ar num
Print lines from today and next
.Ar num
days (forward, future).
.It Fl b
Enforce special date calculation mode for KOI8 calendars.
.It Fl B Ar num
Print lines from today and previous
.Ar num
days (backward, past).
.It Fl f Pa calendarfile
Use
.Pa calendarfile
as the default calendar file.
.It Fl t Ar [[[cc]yy][mm]]dd
Act like the specified value is
.Dq today
instead of using the current date.
.El
.Pp
To handle calendars in your national code table you can specify
.Dq LANG=<locale_name>
in the calendar file as early as possible.
To handle national Easter names in the calendars,
.Dq Easter=<national_name>
(for Catholic Easter) or
.Dq Paskha=<national_name>
(for Orthodox Easter) can be used.
.Pp
To enforce special date calculation mode for Cyrillic calendars
you should specify
.Dq LANG=<local_name>
and
.Dq BODUN=<bodun_prefix>
where <local_name> can be ru_RU.KOI8-R, uk_UA.KOI8-U or by_BY.KOI8-B.
.Pp
Other lines should begin with a month and day.
They may be entered in almost any format, either numeric or as character
strings.
If proper locale is set, national months and weekdays
names can be used.
A single asterisk (`*') matches every month.
A day without a month matches that day of every week.
A month without a day matches the first of that month.
Two numbers default to the month followed by the day.
Lines with leading tabs default to the last entered date, allowing
multiple line specifications for a single date.
.Dq Easter
(may be followed by a positive or negative integer) is Easter for this year.
.Dq Paskha
(may be followed by a positive or negative integer) is
Orthodox Easter for this year.
Weekdays may be followed by
.Dq -4
.Li ...
.Dq +5
(aliases last, first, second, third, fourth) for moving events like
.Dq the last Monday in April .
.Pp
By convention, dates followed by an asterisk
.Pq Sq *
are not fixed, i.e., change
from year to year.
.Pp
Day descriptions start after the first <tab> character in the line;
if the line does not contain a <tab> character, it isn't printed out.
If the first character in the line is a <tab> character, it is treated as
the continuation of the previous description.
.Pp
The calendar file is preprocessed by
.Xr cpp 1 ,
allowing the inclusion of shared files such as company holidays or
meetings.
If the shared file is not referenced by a full pathname,
.Xr cpp 1
searches in the current (or home) directory first, and then in the
directory
.Pa /usr/share/calendar .
Empty lines and lines protected by the C commenting syntax
.Pq Li /* ... */
are ignored.
.Pp
Some possible calendar entries (<tab> characters are highlighted by a
\fB\et\fR sequence):
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
LANG=C
Easter=Ostern

#include <calendar.usholiday>
#include <calendar.birthday>

6/15\fB\et\fRJune 15 (if ambiguous, will default to month/day).
Jun. 15\fB\et\fRJune 15.
15 June\fB\et\fRJune 15.
