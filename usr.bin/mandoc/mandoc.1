.Sh NAME
.Nm mandoc
.Nd format and display UNIX manuals
.
.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mandoc
.Op Fl V
.Op Fl f Ns Ar option...
.Op Fl m Ns Ar format
.Op Fl W Ns Ar err...
.Op Fl T Ns Ar output
.Op Ar infile...
.
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility formats
.Ux
manual pages for display.  The arguments are as follows:
.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f Ns Ar option...
Override default compiler behaviour.  See
.Sx Compiler Options
for details.
.
.It Fl m Ns Ar format
Input format.  See
.Sx Input Formats
for available formats.  Defaults to
.Fl m Ns Ar andoc .
.
.It Fl T Ns Ar output
Output format.  See
.Sx Output Formats
for available formats.  Defaults to
.Fl T Ns Ar ascii .
.
.It Fl V
Print version and exit.
.
.It Fl W Ns Ar err...
Configure warning messages.  Use
.Fl W Ns Ar all
to print warnings,
.Fl W Ns Ar error
for warnings to be considered errors and cause utility
termination.  Multiple
.Fl W
arguments may be comma-separated, such as
.Fl W Ns Ar error,all .
.
.It Ar infile...
Read input from zero or more
.Ar infile .
If unspecified, reads from stdin.  If multiple files are specified,
.Nm
will halt with the first failed parse.
.El
.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
reads
.Xr mdoc 7
or
.Xr man 7
text from stdin, implying
.Fl m Ns Ar andoc ,
and prints 78-column backspace-encoded output to stdout as if
.Fl T Ns Ar ascii
were provided.
.
.Pp
.Ex -std mandoc
.
.
.Ss Punctuation and Spacing
If punctuation is set apart from words, such as in the phrase
.Dq to be \&, or not to be ,
it's processed by
.Nm
according to the following rules:  opening punctuation
.Po
.Sq \&( ,
.Sq \&[ ,
and
.Sq \&{
.Pc
is not followed by a space; closing punctuation
.Po
.Sq \&. ,
.Sq \&, ,
.Sq \&; ,
.Sq \&: ,
.Sq \&? ,
.Sq \&! ,
.Sq \&) ,
.Sq \&]
and
.Sq \&}
.Pc
is not preceded by whitespace.
.
.Pp
If the input is
.Xr mdoc 7 ,
these rules are also applied to macro arguments when appropriate.
.
.Pp
White-space, in non-literal (normal) mode, is stripped from input and
replaced on output by a single space.  Thus, if you wish to preserve multiple
spaces, they must be space-escaped or used in a literal display mode, e.g.,
.Sq \&Bd \-literal
in
.Xr mdoc 7 .
.
.
.Ss Input Formats
The
.Nm
utility accepts
.Xr mdoc 7
and
.Xr man 7
input with
.Fl m Ns Ar doc
and
.Fl m Ns Ar an ,
respectively.  The
.Xr mdoc 7
format is
.Em strongly
recommended;
.Xr man 7
should only be used for legacy manuals.
.
.Pp
A third option,
.Fl m Ns Ar andoc ,
which is also the default, determines encoding on-the-fly: if the first
non-comment macro is
.Sq \&Dd
or
.Sq \&Dt ,
the
.Xr mdoc 7
parser is used; otherwise, the
.Xr man 7
parser is used.
.
.Pp
If multiple
files are specified with
.Fl m Ns Ar andoc ,
each has its file-type determined this way.  If multiple files are
specified and
.Fl m Ns Ar doc
or
.Fl m Ns Ar an
is specified, then this format is used exclusively.
.
.
.Ss Output Formats
The
.Nm
utility accepts the following
.Fl T
arguments:
.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl T Ns Ar ascii
Produce 7-bit ASCII output, backspace-encoded for bold and underline
styles.  This is the default.
.
.It Fl T Ns Ar tree
Produce an indented parse tree.
.
.It Fl T Ns Ar lint
Parse only: produce no output.
.El
.
.Pp
If multiple input files are specified, these will be processed by the
corresponding filter in-order.
.
.
.Ss Compiler Options
Default compiler behaviour may be overriden with the
.Fl f
flag.
.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f Ns Ar ign-scope
When rewinding the scope of a block macro, forces the compiler to ignore
scope violations.  This can seriously mangle the resulting tree.
.Pq mdoc only
.
.It Fl f Ns Ar no-ign-escape
Don't ignore invalid escape sequences.
.
.It Fl f Ns Ar no-ign-macro
Do not ignore unknown macros at the start of input lines.
.
.It Fl f Ns Ar no-ign-chars
Do not ignore disallowed characters.
.
.It Fl f Ns Ar strict
Implies
.Fl f Ns Ar no-ign-escape ,
.Fl f Ns Ar no-ign-macro
and
.Fl f Ns Ar no-ign-chars .
.
.It Fl f Ns Ar ign-errors
Don't halt when encountering parse errors.  Useful with
.Fl T Ns Ar lint
over a large set of manuals passed on the command line.
.El
.
.Pp
As with the
.Fl W
flag, multiple
.Fl f
options may be grouped and delimited with a comma.  Using
.Fl f Ns Ar ign-scope,no-ign-escape ,
for example, will try to ignore scope and not ignore character-escape
errors.
.
.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To page manuals to the terminal:
.
.Pp
.D1 % mandoc \-Wall,error \-fstrict mandoc.1 2>&1 | less
.D1 % mandoc mandoc.1 mdoc.3 mdoc.7 | less
.
.Pp
To check over a large set of manuals:
.
.Pp
.Dl % mandoc \-Tlint \-fign-errors `find /usr/src -name \e*\e.[1-9]`
.
.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
This section summarises
.Nm
compatibility with
.Xr groff 1 .
Each input and output format is separately noted.
.
.
.Ss ASCII output
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
The 
.Sq \e~
special character doesn't produce expected behaviour in 
.Fl T Ns Ar ascii .
.
.It
The 
.Sq \&Bd \-literal
and 
.Sq \&Bd \-unfilled
macros of
.Xr mdoc 7
in
.Fl T Ns Ar ascii
are synonyms, as are \-filled and \-ragged.
.
.It
In 
.Xr groff 1 ,
the
.Sq \&Pa
.Xr mdoc 7
macro does not underline when scoped under an
.Sq \&It
in the FILES section.  This behaves correctly in
.Nm .
.
.It
A list or display following
.Sq \&Ss
.Xr mdoc 7
macro in
.Fl T Ns Ar ascii
does not assert a prior vertical break, just as it doesn't with
.Sq \&Sh .
.
.It
The
.Sq \&na
and
.Sq \&Dt
.Xr man 7
macros in
.Fl T Ns Ar ascii
have no effect.
.
.It
Words aren't hyphenated.
.
.It
In normal mode (not a literal block), blocks of spaces aren't preserved,
so double spaces following sentence closure are reduced to a single space;
.Xr groff 1
retains spaces.
.
.It
Sentences are unilaterally monospaced.
