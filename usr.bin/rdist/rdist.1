.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a program to maintain identical copies of files over multiple hosts.
It preserves the owner, group, mode, and mtime of files if possible and
can update programs that are executing.
.Pp
.Nm
reads commands from
.Pa distfile
to direct the updating of files and/or directories.
If
.Pa distfile
is
.Sq - ,
the standard input is used.
If no
.Fl f
option is present, the program looks first for
.Pa distfile ,
then
.Pa Distfile ,
to use as the input.
If no names are specified on the command line,
.Nm
will update all of the files and directories listed in
.Pa distfile .
If the file
.Pa /etc/Distfile
exists,
it will be run automatically by the clock daemon
.Xr cron 8 ,
via the system script
.Xr daily 8 .
.Pp
If
.Ar name
is specified,
it is taken to be the name of a file to be updated
or the label of a command to execute.
If label and file names conflict, it is assumed to be a label.
These may be used together to update specific files using specific commands.
.Pp
.Nm
uses a remote shell command to access each target host.
By default,
.Xr ssh 1
is used unless overridden by the
.Fl P
option or the
.Ev RSH
environment variable.
If the target host is the string
.Dq localhost
and the remote user name is the same as the local user name,
.Nm
will run the command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/bin/sh -c rdistd -S
.Ed
.Pp
Otherwise,
.Nm
will run the command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ssh \*(Lthost\*(Gt -l \*(Ltlogin_name\*(Gt rdistd -S
.Ed
.Pp
.Ar host
is the name of the target host;
.Ar login_name
is the name of the user to make the connection as.
.Pp
On each target host
.Nm
will attempt to run the command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
rdistd -S
.Ed
.Pp
Or if the
.Fl p
option was specified,
.Nm
will attempt to run the command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\*(Ltrdistd path\*(Gt -S
.Ed
.Pp
If no
.Fl p
option is specified, or
.Aq Ar rdistd path
is a simple filename,
.Xr rdistd 1
or
.Aq Ar rdistd path
must be somewhere in the
.Ev PATH
of the user running
.Nm
on the remote (target) host.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl A Ar num
Set the minimum number of free files (inodes) on a filesystem that must exist
for
.Nm
to update or install a file.
.It Fl a Ar num
Set the minimum amount of free space (in bytes) on a filesystem that must exist
for
.Nm
to update or install a file.
.It Fl c Ar mini_distfile
Forces
.Nm
to interpret the remaining arguments as a small distfile.
The format is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ rdist -c name ... [login@]host[:dest]
.Ed
.Pp
The equivalent distfile is as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
(  name ... ) -\*(Gt [login@]host
	install	[dest] ;
.Ed
.It Fl D
Enable copious debugging messages.
.It Xo
.Fl d Ar var Ns = Ns Ar value
.Xc
Define
.Ar var
to have
.Ar value .
This
option is used to define or override variable definitions in
.Pa distfile .
.Ar value
can be the empty string, one name, or a list of names surrounded by
parentheses and separated by tabs and/or spaces.
.It Fl F
Do not fork any child
.Nm
processes.
All clients are updated sequentially.
.It Fl f Ar distfile
Set the name of the distfile to
.Ar distfile .
If
.Sq -
(dash) is used then read from standard input (stdin).
.It Fl L Ar remote_logopts
Set remote logging options.
See the section
.Sx MESSAGE LOGGING
for details on the syntax for
.Ar remote_logopts .
.It Fl l Ar local_logopts
Set local logging options.
See the section
.Sx MESSAGE LOGGING
for details on the syntax for
.Ar local_logopts .
.It Fl M Ar maxproc
Set the maximum number of simultaneously running child
.Nm
processes to
.Ar maxproc .
The default is 4.
.It Fl m Ar host
Limit which machines are to be updated.
Multiple
.Fl m
arguments can be given to limit updates to a subset of the hosts listed in
.Pa distfile .
.It Fl n
Print the commands without executing them.
This option is useful for debugging a distfile.
.It Fl o Ar distopts
Specify the dist options to enable.
.Ar distopts
is a comma separated list of options which are listed below.
The valid values for
.Ar distopts
are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic chknfs
Do not check or update files on the target host
that reside on NFS filesystems.
.It Ic chkreadonly
Enable a check on the target host
to see if a file resides on a read-only filesystem.
If a file does, then no checking or updating of the file is attempted.
.It Ic chksym
If the target on the remote host is a symbolic link, but is not on the
master host, the remote target will be left a symbolic link.
This behavior is generally considered a bug in the original version of
.Nm rdist ,
but is present to allow compatibility with older versions.
.It Ic compare
Binary comparison.
Perform a binary comparison and update files if they differ rather than
comparing dates and sizes.
.It Ic defgroup Ns Op = Ns Ar groupname
If the group of a file to be transferred does not exist on the destination
host, use the specified group instead.
If
.Ar groupname
is not specified, the
.Em bin
group is used.
.It Ic defowner Ns Op = Ns Ar owner
If the owner of a file to be transferred does not exist on the destination
host, use the specified owner instead.
If
.Ar owner
is not specified, the user
.Em bin
is used.
.It Ic follow
Follow symbolic links.
Copy the file that the link points to rather than the link itself.
.It Ic history
When
.Ic savetargets
and
.Ic history
are both defined then the target file that is updated is first renamed from
.Pa file
to
.Pa file.NNN
where NNN increases for each generation update.
The first generation is 001, and the last is 999.
After 999 generations, the counter is reset and stuck to 001,
and 001 will get overwritten all the time.
This is undesirable behavior, so some other method needs to be devised
to clean up or limit the number of generations.
.It Ic ignlnks
Ignore unresolved links.
.Nm
will normally try to maintain the link structure of files being transferred
and warn the user if all the links cannot be found.
.It Ic nochkgroup
Do not check group ownership of files that already exist.
The file ownership is only set when the file is updated.
.It Ic nochkmode
Do not check file and directory permission modes.
The permission mode is only set when the file is updated.
.It Ic nochkowner
Do not check user ownership of files that already exist.
The file ownership is only set when the file is updated.
.It Ic nodescend
Do not descend into a directory.
Normally,
.Nm
will recursively check directories.
If this option is enabled, then any files listed in the file list in the
distfile that are directories are not recursively scanned.
Only the existence, ownership, and mode of the directory are checked.
.It Ic noexec
Automatically exclude executable binary files in
.Xr elf 5
format from being checked or updated.
.It Ic numchkgroup
Use the numeric group ID (GID) to check group ownership instead of
the group name.
.It Ic numchkowner
Use the numeric user ID (UID) to check user ownership instead of
the user name.
.It Ic quiet
Quiet mode.
Files that are being modified are normally printed on standard output.
This option suppresses that.
.It Ic remove
Remove extraneous files.
If a directory is being updated, any files that exist on the remote host
that do not exist in the master directory are removed.
This is useful for maintaining truly identical copies of directories.
.It Ic savetargets
Save files that are updated instead of removing them.
Any target file that is updated is first renamed from
.Pa file
to
.Pa file.OLD .
.It Ic sparse
Enable checking for sparse files.
One of the most common types of sparse files are those produced by
.Xr dbopen 3 .
This option adds some additional processing overhead so it should
only be enabled for targets likely to contain sparse files.
.It Ic updateperm
Do not send the whole file when the size and the modification time match.
Instead, just update the ownership, group, and permissions as necessary.
.It Ic verify
Verify that the files are up to date on all the hosts.
Any files that are out of date will be displayed
but no files will be changed and no mail will be sent.
.It Ic whole
Whole mode.
The whole file name is appended to the destination directory name.
Normally, only the last component of a name is used when renaming files.
This will preserve the directory structure of the files being
copied instead of flattening the directory structure.
For example, rdisting a list of files such as
.Pa /p/dir1/f1
and
.Pa /p/dir2/f2
to
.Pa /tmp/dir
would create files
.Pa /tmp/dir/p/dir1/f1
and
.Pa /tmp/dir/p/dir2/f2
instead of
.Pa /tmp/dir/dir1/f1
and
.Pa /tmp/dir/dir2/f2 .
.It Ic younger
Younger mode.
Files are normally updated if their
.Em mtime
and
.Em size
(see
.Xr stat 2 )
disagree.
This option causes
.Nm
not to update files that are younger than the master copy.
This can be used to prevent newer copies on other hosts from being replaced.
A warning message is printed for files which are newer than the master copy.
.El
.It Fl P Ar rsh-path
Set the path to the remote shell command.
.Ar rsh-path
may be a colon separated list of possible pathnames,
in which case the first component of the path to exist is used.
.It Fl p Ar rdistd-path
Set the path where the rdistd server is searched for on the target host.
.It Fl t Ar timeout
Set the timeout period,
in seconds,
for waiting for responses from the remote
.Nm
server.
The default is 900 seconds.
.It Fl V
Print version information and exit.
.El
.Sh DISTFILES
The
.Pa distfile
contains a sequence of entries that specify the files
to be copied, the destination hosts, and what operations to perform
to do the updating.
Each entry has one of the following formats.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\*(Ltvariable name\*(Gt = \*(Ltname list\*(Gt
[ label: ] \*(Ltsource list\*(Gt -\*(Gt \*(Ltdestination list\*(Gt \*(Ltcommand list\*(Gt
[ label: ] \*(Ltsource list\*(Gt :: \*(Lttimestamp file\*(Gt \*(Ltcommand list\*(Gt
.Ed
.Pp
The first format is used for defining variables.
The second format is used for distributing files to other hosts.
The third format is used for making lists of files that have been changed
since some given date.
The
.Ar source list
specifies a list of files and/or directories on the local host which are to
be used as the master copy for distribution.
The
.Ar destination list
is the list of hosts to which these files are to be copied.
Each file in the source list is added to a list of changes if the file
is out of date on the host which is being updated (second format) or
the file is newer than the
.Ar timestamp file
(third format).
.Pp
Newlines, tabs, and blanks are only used as separators and are
otherwise ignored.
Comments begin with
.Sq #
and end with a newline.
.Pp
Variables to be expanded begin with
.Sq $
followed by one character or a name enclosed in curly braces
(see the examples at the end).
.Pp
Labels are optional.
They are used to identify a specific command to execute
(for example, allowing an update of a subset of a repository).
.Pp
The source and destination lists have the following format:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\*(Ltname\*(Gt
.Ed
or
.Bd -literal -compact -offset indent
`(' \*(Ltzero or more names separated by whitespace\*(Gt `)'
.Ed
.Pp
These simple lists can be modified by using one level of set addition,
subtraction, or intersection like this:
.Pp
.Dl list - list
or
.Dl list + list
or
.Dl list & list
.Pp
If additional modifications are needed (e.g.\&
.Do
all servers and client machines except for the OSF/1 machines
.Dc )
then the list will have to be explicitly constructed in steps using
.Dq temporary
variables.
.Pp
The shell meta-characters `[', `]', `{', `}', `*', and `?'
are recognized and expanded (on the local host only) in the same way as
.Xr ksh 1 .
They can be escaped with a backslash.
The `~' character is also expanded in the same way as
.Xr ksh 1
but is expanded separately on the local and destination hosts.
When the
.Fl o Ar whole
option is used with a file name that begins with `~', everything except the
home directory is appended to the destination name.
File names which do not begin with `/' or `~' use the destination user's
home directory as the root directory for the rest of the file name.
.Pp
The command list consists of zero or more commands of the following
format:
.Bl -column "except_pat" "<pattern list>" "opt_dest_name" ";" -offset indent
.It install Ta \*(Ltoptions\*(Gt Ta opt_dest_name Ta ;
.It notify Ta \*(Ltname list\*(Gt Ta "" Ta ;
.It except Ta \*(Ltname list\*(Gt Ta "" Ta ;
.It except_pat Ta \*(Ltpattern list\*(Gt Ta "" Ta ;
.It special Ta \*(Ltname list\*(Gt Ta string Ta ;
.It cmdspecial Ta \*(Ltname list\*(Gt Ta string Ta ;
.El
.Pp
The
.Cm install
command is used to copy out-of-date files and/or directories.
Each source file is copied to each host in the destination list.
Directories are recursively copied in the same way.
.Ar opt_dest_name
is an optional parameter to rename files.
If no
.Cm install
command appears in the command list or the destination name is not specified,
the source file name is used.
Directories in the path name will be created if they
do not exist on the remote host.
The
.Fl o Ar distopts
option as specified above has the same semantics as
on the command line except
.Ar distopts
only applies to the files in the source list.
The login name used on the destination host is the same as the local host
unless the destination name is of the format
.Dq login@host .
.Pp
The
.Cm notify
command is used to mail the list of files updated (and any errors
that may have occurred) to the listed names.
If no `@' appears in the name, the destination host is appended to
the name
(e.g. name1@host, name2@host, ...).
.Pp
The
.Cm except
command is used to update all of the files in the source list
.Sy except
for the files listed in
.Ar name list .
This is usually used to copy everything in a directory except certain files.
.Pp
The
.Cm except_pat
command is like the
.Cm except
command except that
.Ar pattern list
is a list of basic regular expressions
(see
.Xr re_format 7
for details).
If one of the patterns matches some string within a file name, that file will
be ignored.
Note that since `\e' is a quote character, it must be doubled to become
part of the regular expression.
Variables are expanded in
.Ar pattern list
but not shell file pattern matching characters.
To include a `$', it must be escaped with `\e'.
.Pp
The
.Cm special
command is used to specify
.Xr sh 1
commands that are to be executed on the remote host after the file in
.Ar name list
is updated or installed.
If the
.Ar name list
is omitted then the shell commands will be executed for every file
updated or installed.
.Ar string
starts and ends with `"' and can cross multiple lines in
.Pa distfile .
Multiple commands to the shell should be separated by `;'.
Commands are executed in the user's home directory on the host
being updated.
The
.Cm special
command can be used, for example, to rebuild private databases
after a program has been updated.
The following environment variables are set for each
.Cm special
command:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "BASEFILE" -offset 3n -compact
.It Ev FILE
The full pathname of the local file that was just updated.
.It Ev REMFILE
The full pathname of the remote file that was just updated.
.It BASEFILE
The basename of the remote file that was just updated.
.El
.Pp
The
.Cm cmdspecial
command is similar to the
.Cm special
command, except it is executed only when the entire command is completed
instead of after each file is updated.
The list of files is placed in the
.Ev FILES
environment variable.
Each file name in
.Ev FILES
is separated by a
.Sq :\&
(colon).
.Pp
If a hostname ends in a
.Sq +
(plus sign),
then the plus
is stripped off and NFS checks are disabled.
This is equivalent to disabling the
.Fl o Ar chknfs
option just for this one host.
.Sh MESSAGE LOGGING
.Nm
uses a collection of predefined message
.Em facilities
that each contain a list of message
.Em types
specifying which types of messages to send to that facility.
The local client
and the remote server
each maintain their own copy
of what types of messages to log to what facilities.
.Pp
The
.Fl l
.Ar local_logopts
option specifies the logging options to use locally;
.Fl L
.Ar remote_logopts
specifies the logging options to pass to the remote server.
.Pp
Logging options should be of the form:
.Pp
.D1 facility=types:facility=types...
.Pp
The valid facility names are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Ic file
Log to a file.
To specify the file name, use the format
.Dq file=filename=types .
For example:
.Pp
.Dl file=/tmp/rdist.log=all,debug
.It Ic notify
Use the internal
.Nm
.Ic notify
facility.
This facility is used in conjunction with the
.Ic notify
keyword in a
.Pa distfile
to specify what messages are mailed to the
.Ic notify
address.
.It Ic stdout
Messages to standard output.
.It Ic syslog
Use the
.Xr syslogd 8
facility.
.El
.Pp
.Ar types
should be a comma separated list of message types.
Each message type specified enables that message level.
This is unlike the
.Xr syslog 3
system facility which uses an ascending order scheme.
The following are the valid types:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It Ic all
All but debug messages.
.It Ic change
Things that change.
This includes files that are installed or updated in some way.
.It Ic debug
Debugging information.
.It Ic ferror
Fatal errors.
.It Ic info
General information.
.It Ic nerror
Normal errors that are not fatal.
.It Ic notice
General info about things that change.
This includes things like making directories which are needed in order
to install a specific target, but which are not explicitly specified in the
.Pa distfile .
.It Ic warning
Warnings about errors which are not as serious as
.Ic nerror
type messages.
.El
.Pp
Here is a sample command line option:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
-l stdout=all:syslog=change,notice:file=/tmp/rdist.log=all
.Ed
.Pp
This entry will set local message logging to have all but debug
messages sent to standard output, change and notice messages will
be sent to
.Xr syslog 3 ,
and all messages will be written to the file
.Pa /tmp/rdist.log .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "TMPDIR"
.It RSH
Name of the default remote shell program to use.
The default is
.Xr ssh 1 .
.It TMPDIR
Name of the temporary directory to use.
The default is
.Pa /tmp .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "$TMPDIR/rdist*XXX" -compact
.It Pa {d,D}istfile
.Nm
command file.
.It Pa /etc/Distfile
System-wide
.Nm
command file.
.It Pa $TMPDIR/rdist*
Temporary file for update lists.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following is an example
.Pa distfile :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
HOSTS = ( matisse root@arpa)

FILES = ( /bin /lib /usr/bin /usr/games
	/usr/include/{*.h,{stand,sys,vax*,pascal,machine}/*.h}
	/usr/lib /usr/man/man? /usr/ucb /usr/local/rdist )

EXLIB = ( Mail.rc aliases aliases.db crontab dshrc
	sendmail.cf sendmail.hf sendmail.st uucp vfont )

${FILES} -\*(Gt ${HOSTS}
	install -oremove,chknfs ;
	except /usr/lib/${EXLIB} ;
	except /usr/games/lib ;
	special /usr/lib/sendmail "/usr/lib/sendmail -bi" ;

srcs:
/usr/src/bin -\*(Gt arpa
	except_pat ( \e\e.o\e$ /SCCS\e$ ) ;

IMAGEN = (ips dviimp catdvi)

imagen:
/usr/local/${IMAGEN} -\*(Gt arpa
	install /usr/local/lib ;
	notify ralph ;

sendmail.cf :: stamp.cory
	notify root@cory ;
.Ed
.Pp
Using the above
.Pa distfile :
.Pp
Update everything that's out of date,
making any relevant notifications:
.Pp
.Dl $ rdist
.Pp
Update files in
.Pa /usr/src/bin
to host
.Dq arpa ,
except for files with names ending
.Dq .o
or
.Dq /SCCS :
.Pp
.Dl $ rdist srcs
.Pp
Update
.Pa sendmail.cf
if it's older than timestamp file
.Pa stamp.cory ,
notifying root@cory if an update has happened:
.Pp
.Dl $ rdist sendmail.cf
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr rdistd 1 ,
.Xr sh 1 ,
.Xr ssh 1 ,
.Xr re_format 7 ,
.Xr daily 8 ,
.Xr syslogd 8
.Sh STANDARDS
The options
.Op Fl bhiNOqRrsvwxy
are still recognized for backwards compatibility.
.Sh CAVEATS
If the basename of a file
(the last component in the pathname)
is
.Sq .\& ,
.Nm
assumes the remote (destination) name is a directory.
That is,
.Pa /tmp/.\&
means that
.Pa /tmp
should be a directory on the remote host.
.Sh BUGS
Source files must reside on the local host where
.Nm
is executed.
.Pp
Variable expansion only works for name lists;
there should be a general macro facility.
.Pp
.Nm
aborts on files which have a negative mtime (before Jan 1, 1970).
.Pp
If a hardlinked file is listed more than once in the same target,
.Nm
will report missing links.
Only one instance of a link should be listed in each target.
.Pp
The
.Ic defowner ,
.Ic defgroup ,
and
.Ic updateperm
options are extensions to the 6.1.0 protocol and will not work with earlier
versions of rdist 6.
