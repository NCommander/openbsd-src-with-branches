.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
returns a message to the sender of a message telling them that you
are currently not reading your mail.
The intended use is in a
.Pa .forward
file.
For example, your
.Pa .forward
file might have:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\eeric, "|/usr/bin/vacation -a allman eric"
.Ed
.Pp
which would send messages to you (assuming your login name was eric) and
reply to any messages for
.Dq eric
or
.Dq allman .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a Ar alias
Handle messages for
.Ar alias
in the same manner as those received for the user's
login name.
.It Fl i
Initialize the vacation database files.
It should be used before you modify your
.Pa .forward
file.
.It Fl r Ar interval
Set the reply interval to
.Ar interval
days.
The default is one week.
An interval of
.Dq 0
or
.Dq Li infinite
(actually, any non-numeric character) will never send more than
one reply.
.El
.Pp
Messages will not be replied to
if any of the following conditions are true:

Berkeley DB database in the file
.Pa .vacation.db
in your home directory.
.Pp
.Nm
expects a file
.Pa .vacation.msg ,
in your home directory, containing a message to be sent back to each
sender.
It should be an entire message (including headers).
For example, it might contain:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
From: eric@CS.Berkeley.EDU (Eric Allman)
Subject: I am on vacation
Delivered-By-The-Graces-Of: The Vacation program
Precedence: bulk

.Pp
Any occurrence of the string
.Li $SUBJECT
in
.Pa .vacation.msg
will be replaced by the subject of the message that triggered the
.Nm
program.
.Pp
.Nm
reads the incoming message from standard input, checking the message
headers for either the
.Ux
.Dq From
line or a
.Dq Return-Path
header to determine the sender.
If both are present the sender from the
.Dq Return-Path
header is used.
.Pp
Fatal errors, such as calling
.Nm
with incorrect arguments, or with non-existent
.Ar login Ns Ar s ,
are logged in the system log file, using
.Xr syslog 3 .
