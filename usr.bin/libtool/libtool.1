.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm libtool
.Nd compile and link complex libraries
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is supposed to be a drop-in replacement for the eponymous GNU project.
The following differences in behaviour with GNU Libtool are intentional:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Relative
.Fl L
paths are put before absolute ones.
This fixes many (but not all, unfortunately) issues when software
links to libraries already installed instead of those just built because,
for example,
.Qq -L/usr/local/lib
comes before
.Qq -L../libfoo .
.It
Extra (duplicate)
.Fl L
and
.Fl l
items are stripped from the link command line.
.It
When both
.Qq -lstdc++
and
.Qq -lestdc++
are encountered in the link command line, only the latter is kept.
