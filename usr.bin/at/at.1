.Sh NAME
.Nm at ,
.Nm batch
.Nd queue, examine or delete jobs for later execution
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm at
.Op Fl bm
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl l Op Ar job ...
.Op Fl q Ar queue
.Fl t Ar time_arg | timespec
.Nm at
.Fl c | r
.Ar job ...
.Nm batch
.Op Fl m
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl q Ar queue
.Op Ar timespec
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm at
and
.Nm batch
read commands from standard input or a specified file which
are to be executed at a later time, via the user's shell as
specified by the
.Ev SHELL
environment variable.
If
.Ev SHELL
is not set, the shell in the user's password database entry is used
instead.
If all else fails,
.Xr sh 1
will be used.
.Pp
The related programs are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Nm at
Executes commands at a specified time.
.It Nm batch
Executes commands when system load levels permit.
In other words, when
the load average drops below 1.5, or the value specified in the invocation of
.Xr cron 8 .
.El
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b
An alias for
.Nm batch .
.It Fl c Ar job ...
Prints the jobs listed on the command line to standard output.
.It Fl f Ar file
Reads the job from
.Ar file
rather than standard input.
.It Fl l Op Ar job ...
Displays the queue of jobs which are currently awaiting execution.
If a
.Ar job
argument is specified, only the specified jobs will be displayed.
Unless the user is the superuser, only the user's own jobs will be
displayed.
.It Fl m
Send mail to the user when the job has completed, even if there was no
output.
.It Fl q Ar queue
Uses the specified queue.
A queue designation consists of a single letter.
Valid queue designations range from
.Sy a
to
.Sy z
and
.Sy A
to
.Sy Z .
The
.Sy c
queue is the default for
.Nm at
and the
.Sy E
queue for
.Nm batch .
Queues with higher letters run with increased niceness.
If a job is submitted to a queue designated with an uppercase letter, it
is treated as if it had been submitted to batch at that time.
If the user specified the
.Fl l
option and
.Nm at
is given a specific queue, only jobs pending in that queue will be shown.
.It Fl r Ar job ...
Remove the specified job(s) from the
.Nm at
queue.
.It Fl t Ar time_arg
Specify the job time.
The argument should be of the form
.Oo Oo Ar cc Oc Ns Ar yy Oc Ns Ar mmddHHMM Ns Op \&. Ns Ar SS ,
where the parts of the argument represent the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.It Ar ccyy
Year.
If yy is specified, but cc is not,
a value for yy between 69 and 99 results in a cc value of 19.
Otherwise, a cc value of 20 is used.
.It Ar mm
Month:
a number from 1 to 12.
.It Ar dd
Day:
a number from 1 to 31.
.It Ar HH
Hour:
a number from 0 to 23.
.It Ar MM
Minute:
a number from 0 to 59.
.It Ar SS
Second:
a number from 0 to 60
(permitting a leap second),
preceded by a period.
The default is 0.
.El
.El
.Pp
.Nm at
allows some moderately complex
.Ar timespec
specifications.
It accepts times of the form
.Ar HHMM
or
.Ar HH:MM
to run a job at a specific time of day.
(If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.)
You may also specify
.Cm midnight ,
.Cm noon ,
or
.Cm teatime
(4pm)
and you can have a time-of-day suffixed with
.Cm AM
or
.Cm PM
for running in the morning or the evening.
You can also say what day the job will be run,
by giving a date in the form
.Ar \%month-name day
with an optional
.Ar year ,
or giving a date of the form
.Ar dd.mm.ccyy ,
.Ar dd.mm.yy ,
.Ar mm/dd/ccyy ,
.Ar mm/dd/yy ,
.Ar mmddccyy ,
or
.Ar mmddyy .
.Pp
The year may be given as two or four digits.
If the year is given as two digits, it is taken to occur as soon as
possible in the future, which may be in the next century \(em
unless it's last year, in which case it's considered to be
a typo.
.Pp
The specification of a date must follow the specification of
the time of day.
You can also give times like
.Oo Cm now Oc Cm + Ar count time-units ,
where the time-units can be
.Cm minutes ,
.Cm hours ,
.Cm days ,
.Cm weeks ,
.Cm months ,
or
.Cm years
(the singular forms are also accepted).
You can tell
.Nm at
to run the job today by suffixing the time with
.Cm today
and to run the job tomorrow by suffixing the time with
.Cm tomorrow .
The
.Cm next
keyword may be used as an alias for
.Cm + 1 .
.Pp
For example, to run a job at 4pm three days from now, you would do
.Ic at 4pm + 3 days .
To run a job at 10:00am on July 31, you would do
.Ic at 10am Jul 31 .
To run a job at 1am tomorrow, you would do
.Ic at 1am tomorrow .
To run a job at midnight in one week's time, you would do
.Ic at midnight next week .
.Pp
The
.Nm at
utility also supports the time format used by
.Xr touch 1
(see the
.Fl t
option).
.Pp
For both
.Nm at
and
.Nm batch ,
commands are read from standard input (or the file specified
with the
.Fl f
option) and executed.
The working directory, the environment (except for the variables
.Ev BASH_VERSINFO ,
.Ev DISPLAY ,
.Ev EUID ,
.Ev GROUPS ,
.Ev PPID ,
.Ev SHELLOPTS ,
.Ev SSH_AGENT_PID ,
.Ev SSH_AUTH_SOCK ,
.Ev TERM ,
.Ev TERMCAP ,
.Ev UID ,
and
.Ev _ ) ,
and the
.Ar umask
are retained from the time of invocation.
An
.Nm at
or
.Nm batch
command invoked from a
.Xr su 1
shell will retain the current user ID.
The user will be mailed standard error and standard output from his
commands, if any.
If
.Nm at
is executed from a
.Xr su 1
shell, the owner of the login shell will receive the mail.
.Pp
For non-root users, permission to run
.Nm
is determined by the files
.Pa /var/cron/at.allow
and
.Pa /var/cron/at.deny .
.Em Note :
these files must be readable by group crontab (if they exist).
.Pp
If the file
.Pa /var/cron/at.allow
exists, only usernames mentioned in it are allowed to use
.Nm at .
If
.Pa /var/cron/at.allow
does not exist,
.Pa /var/cron/at.deny
is checked.
Every username not mentioned in it is then allowed to use
.Nm at .
If neither exists, only the superuser is allowed to run
.Nm at .
.Pp
An empty
.Pa /var/cron/at.deny
means that every user is allowed to use these commands.
This is the default configuration.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/cron/at.allow -compact
.It Pa /var/cron/atjobs
directory containing job files
.It Pa /var/cron/at.allow
allow permission control
.It Pa /var/cron/at.deny
deny permission control
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It 0
Jobs were successfully submitted, removed, or listed.
.It >0
An error occurred.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
and
.Nm batch
utilities are compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification.
.Pp
The
.Nm
flags
.Op Fl bc
and the
.Nm batch
flags
.Op Fl fmq ,
as well as
the
.Cm teatime
keyword,
are extensions to that specification.
.Pp
.St -p1003.1-2008
states that
.Nm batch
jobs are submitted to the queue
.Qq with no time constraints ;
this implementation permits a
.Ar timespec
argument.
.Pp
The at.allow/deny mechanism is marked by
.St -p1003.1-2008
as being an
X/Open System Interfaces
option.

.Sh BUGS
.Nm at
and
.Nm batch
as presently implemented are not suitable when users are competing for
resources.
If this is the case for your site, you might want to consider another
batch system, such as
.Nm nqs .
