.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
can be used to dump or modify the state of a USB HID (Human Interface Device).
If a list of items is present on the command line, then
.Nm
prints the current value of those items for the specified device.  If the
.Fl w
flag is specified
.Nm
attempts to set the specified items to the given values.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Show all items and their current values.
.It Fl f Ar device
Specify a path name for the device to operate on.  If
.Ar device
is numeric, it is taken to be the USB HID device number.  If it is a relative
path, it is taken to be the name of the device under
.Pa /dev .
An absolute path is taken to be the literal device pathname.
.It Fl l
Loop and dump the device data every time it changes.  Only 'input' items are
displayed in this mode.
.It Fl n
Suppress printing of the item name when querying specific item values.
.It Fl r
Dump the report descriptor.
.It Fl t Ar table
Specify a path name for the HID usage table file.
.It Fl v
Be verbose.  Repeating this option increases verbosity.
.It Fl w
Change item values.  Only 'output' and 'feature' kinds can be set with this
option.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Ox 3.0 .
.Sh BUGS
Some USB HID devices report multiple items with exactly the same description.
The current naming scheme does not provide the means to specify which of the
identically named items you are referring to.
