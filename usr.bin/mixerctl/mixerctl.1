.Sh NAME
.Nm mixerctl
.Nd control audio mixing
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mixerctl
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl v
.Fl a
.Nm mixerctl
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl v
.Ar name Op Ar ...
.Nm mixerctl
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl n
.Fl w
.Ar name=value Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command displays or sets various audio system mixing variables.
If a list of variables is present on the command line,
.Nm
prints the current value of those variables for the specified device.
By default,
.Nm
operates on the
.Pa /dev/mixer
device.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Print all device variables and their current values.
.It Fl w Ar name=value
Attempt to set the specified variable
.Ar name
to
.Ar value .
.It Fl v
Show the possible values of enumeration and set valued variables.
Enumerated values are shown in
.Dq []
and set values are shown in
.Dq {} .
.It Fl f Ar file
Specify an alternative audio mixing device.
.It Fl n
Suppress printing of the variable name.
.El
.Pp
Values may be specified in either absolute or relative forms.
The relative form is indicated by a prefix of
.Ql +
or
.Ql -
to denote an increase or decrease, respectively.
.Pp
The exact set of controls that can be manipulated depends on
the mixer.
The general format (in both getting and setting a value) is
.Pp
.Va class.name = value
.Pp
The
.Va class
can have values like
.Li inputs
or
.Li outputs
indicating that the control affects the input resp. output to the
mixer.
The
.Va name
indicates what part of the mixer the control affects.
Continuous mixer values, e.g., volume, have numeric values
in the range 0-255.
If value can be set for each channel independently
the values are printed separated by commas.
Discrete mixer values, e.g.,
the recording source, have symbolic names.
Depending on the mixer it
may either be an enumeration or a set.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command
.Pp
.Dl "mixerctl -a -v"
.Pp
can produce
.Bd -literal
inputs.mic=0,0 volume
inputs.mic.mute=off  [ off on ]
inputs.cd=220,220 volume
inputs.cd.mute=off  [ off on ]
inputs.dac=220,220 volume
inputs.dac.mute=off  [ off on ]
record.record=220,220 volume
record.record.source=mic  [ mic cd dac ]
monitor.monitor=0 volume
