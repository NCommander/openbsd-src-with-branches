and probably contains loads of errors. As an example, I can't figure out
why linux doesn't need mkswap as it shares the exact same blocks with
OpenBSD.


	Linux + OpenBSD: it's possible

	by Marc Espie --  Marc.Espie@openbsd.org

It is perfectly possible to have linux and openbsd on the same disk.
As of this writing, OpenBSD can read and write linux' partitions, whereas
Linux cannot access OpenBSD partitions (they differ from NetBSD partitions).

You can even install OpenBSD from an ext2fs partition (choose install from
disk... ext2fs does not appear in the choices, but `default' it is).

First, make a bootable floppy of linux.  Then, you  have to find some room
for OpenBSD.  Don't worry about swap space: you can share Linux' swap
partition.

If you want to grab space from a Windows/DOS partition, use fips.
Fips20 knows all about FAT32, so windows 95 is no longer a problem.

First principles
----------------
OpenBSD does not use the DOS partitions for more than booting.  You just
need a small DOS partition to put your OpenBSD root.  Afterwards, OpenBSD
heeds some other information entirely, called the BSD disklabel.  This
disklabel is another completely distinct description of your hard disk. 
It does not even have to be consistent with the usual DOS partitions 
information.

Throughout this document, we will distinguish between DOS partitions and
BSD partitions whenever this is necessary.

For consistency, it's better if all parts of the disks that 
are actually used by OpenBSD are flagged as occupied, type A6, though it 
is not necessary.  The only part of the disk that should appear both as a BSD
partition and as a DOS partition is the root partition: it MUST begin on
the same sector for the boot process to work.

One way to visualize things is to picture OpenBSD embedded inside DOS
partitions: the DOS partition(s) used by OpenBSD may each contain several
OpenBSD partitions. As long as the DOS partition table has the right
start and length for each partition it will be kept happy.

The OpenBSD disklabel is just another mechanism that yield another 
description of the disk. It is vitally important that the BSD root
partition start precisely where the corresponding DOS partition is supposed
to start, and it is better when all BSD partitions stay inside their
DOS partitions boundary.  Apart from OpenBSD partitions proper, the
BSD disklabel can yield a BSD description of other DOS partitions, but
this is not mandatory. If you don't have any constraints, having a correct
description of all partition is better, but with bigger disks, keep in mind
that OpenBSD disklabels can't hold more than 16 partitions.

Contrarily to popular belief, OpenBSD does *NOT* need one contiguous chunk 
of the disk.  It is probably the simplest setup, but other considerations
(such as the need to boot several OS, and have several small primary
partitions that all start before cylinder 1024) may lead you to use
two chunks for OpenBSD.

If you can, it is MUCH better to devote a full disk to OpenBSD: this limits
the number of mistakes you can do. Admittedly there are some cases where
this isn't a option (my machine is a laptop... I have to cope with the
harddisk I have).

Mapping your disk
-----------------
Starting from Linux, get a grasp of your partitions. Use df to check which
is what, then fdisk to get the actual setup of the disk.
Here is my disk:
--

Disk /dev/hda: 128 heads, 63 sectors, 993 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 8064 * 512 bytes

   Device Boot      Begin    Start      End   Blocks   Id  System
	/dev/hda1            1        1      260  1048288+   6  DOS 16-bit >=32M
	/dev/hda2          261      261      273    52416   83  Linux native
  	/dev/hda4          287      287      600  1270080    5  Extended
	/dev/hda5          287      287      303    68512   82  Linux swap
	/dev/hda6          304      304      456   616864+  83  Linux native
	/dev/hda7          457      457      520   258016+  83  Linux native
	/dev/hda8          521      521      537    68512+  83  Linux native
	/dev/hda9          538      538      601   258016+  83  Linux native

(In case you're wondering, yes this is a big disk. The linux playground is 
large, the OpenBSD area will be huge. As a developper, I usually have loads
of source & binaries lying around... a simple OpenBSD installation can fit
within 300 Mb with room to spare).
In my setup hda2 is /, hda6 is /usr, hda7 is /usr/local hda8 is /var, and
hda9 is /home.

Get the display to sectors with u, and jot down the corresponding
information as well:
--
Disk /dev/hda: 128 heads, 63 sectors, 993 cylinders
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 bytes

   Device Boot      Begin    Start      End   Blocks   Id  System
	/dev/hda1           63       63  2096639  1048288+   6  DOS 16-bit >=32M
	/dev/hda2      2096640  2096640  2201471    52416   83  Linux native
	/dev/hda4      2306304  2306304  4846464  1270080    5  Extended
	/dev/hda5      2306368  2306368  2443391    68512   82  Linux swap
	/dev/hda6      2443455  2443455  3677183   616864+  83  Linux native
	/dev/hda7      3677247  3677247  4193279   258016+  83  Linux native
	/dev/hda8      4193343  4193343  4330367    68512+  83  Linux native
	/dev/hda9      4330431  4330431  4846463   258016+  83  Linux native

Okay, finally switch to expert mode, and note the corresponding data.
Disk /dev/hda: 128 heads, 63 sectors, 993 cylinders

Nr AF  Hd Sec  Cyl  Hd Sec  Cyl   Start    Size ID
 1 00   1   1    0 127  63  259      63 2096577 06
 2 00   0   1  260 127  63  272 2096640  104832 83
 3 00   0   0    0   0   0    0       0       0 00
 4 00   0   1  286 127  63  600 2306304 2540160 05
 5 00   1   2  286 127  63  302      64  137024 82
 6 00   1   1  303 127  63  455      63 1233729 83
 7 00   1   1  456 127  63  519      63  516033 83
 8 00   1   1  520 127  63  536      63  137025 83
 9 00   1   1  537 127  63  600      63  516033 83

Note that this is STILL the same data. The good point about this last
display is that it is almost what you're going to see in OpenBSD fdisk !
The only difference is that:
- OpenBSD fdisk displays cyl/hd/sec, which is a more sensible order.
- OpenBSD fdisk displays `real' offsets from the beginning of the disk.

You will notice that the 3rd primary partition is empty... this is where 
I intend to stick my OpenBSD root partition (both DOS and BSD partitions),
and that I have cylinders 602-993 empty... this is where I intend to
stick the rest of OpenBSD.

Before starting to install OpenBSD, now would be a good time to check the
INSTALL.pt document...  Especially note the alignment restriction of 
partitions (first sector of a partition must be at head 0, sector 1 of a
cylinder). This is enforced by linux' fdisk.

The other point to note is that extended partitions are actually linked
lists. This will also show up in OpenBSD' fdisk.

Your clock and OpenBSD
----------------------
OpenBSD expects your hardware clock to be in universal time, and uses 
timezones to give you local time. With linux, this depends... 
most distributions use a small program called hwclock to set up the 
system time from the hardware clock when booting... there is a --utc 
option if your hardware clock is in universal time, but this is not 
always what happens by default.

Check your distribution, on redhat 5.1, this occurs in /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit
which loads /etc/sysconfig/clock which defines a variable called UTC before
calling hwclock.
- ensure UTC is set to true
- adjust your hardware clock from the system time if necessary, e.g.,
hwclock --systohc --utc

Linux fs and OpenBSD
--------------------
There is a problem with many linux rc that do mount all filesystems even
in single-user mode. After you've installed OpenBSD, if your linux kernel
knows about bsd disklabels, it may insert lots of bsd partitions in its
list. Then at the next reboot, you're in trouble. The simplest way around
that is probably to make sure you have a linux kernel around that doesn't
know about disklabels.   Otherwise, you may wish to check your inittab
and your rc to make deadly sure that single-user boot will work.

The OpenBSD installation
------------------------
If you've got the space, you can install from your ext2fs partitions. This
is what I did, as I have a slip connexion to the rest of the world, and
the OpenBSD install floppy does not include slip.

REMEMBER TO BACKUP ALL IMPORTANT DATA ON YOUR DISK BEFORE DOING THE 
INSTALLATION !!!

So you cp floppy*.fs /dev/fd0, then reboot...
After a while, you will see your disk configuration scroll up.
I got:
wd0 at wdc0 drive 0: <TOSHIBA MK4006MAV>
wd0: 3909MB, 7944 cyl, 16 head, 63 sec, 512 bytes/sec, 8007552 sec total
wd0: using 16-sector 16-bit pio transfers, lba addressing
at which point I got somewhat confused, especially as this is a config with
more than 1024 cylinders.  In fact, this is the real disk geometry, when
you inquire about it, but the geometry that the BIOS sees IS the fdisk
geometry, with 993 cylinders.  As the 1024 cylinders is purely a BIOS
limitation, there is no actual trouble.
If you want to be sure, right after the machine loads the kernel, there is
a boot prompt:
boot>
at which point you can enter: machine diskconfig
before the automatic boot sequence continues.

Then I got into fdisk, and I proceeded to enter my new OpenBSD partition.
This is what the fdisk dump looked after I added the OpenBSD partition:

Nothing to it... you just follow the extended partition links using select,
jot down whatever you need, add the OpenBSD partition to look like you want
it to, and save everything.

After you leave fdisk, you get to the interesting part: the disklabel
itself. If all goes well, OpenBSD synthetizes a nice disklabel out of what
it can deduce from the disk, including the ext2fs partitions.

There are only a few subtleties to take care of:
- initially, you can ONLY edit the disklabel part that matches the OpenBSD
DOS partition (a `slice' in FreeBSD linguo). You can use b 0 * to be able
to edit the whole disk,
- the real disk geometry becomes relevant. OpenBSD file system can't use 
partial cylinder groups, hence bsd partitions should start on cylinder
boundaries, any remaining sectors  will be lost anyway.
- units for size and offset can be given as sectors (default) or cylinders
(suffix c).

After edition, this is what my disklabel looks like:

# using MBR partition 2: type A6 off 2201472 (0x219780) size 104832 (0x19980)

Things to check:
- this disklabel is saved in MBR2 (basic dos partition 2), as expected.
- all the bsd partitions proper are aligned on a cylinder boundary.
the root partition begins at the precise same offset the corresponding DOS
partition begins, and it extends for the same length.
Other bsd partitions don't show up in the dos partition setup, hence they
begin precisely on cylinder 601/4808.
- the ext2fs partitions have the exact same layout under the OpenBSD
disklabel.

One point that is somewhat laborious is that the disklabel -E mode
(which you are currently using) tends to move partitions around to ensure
that ALL partitions fit are contiguous. Hence, you may need some fiddling
and printing around to ensure that Linux partitions do show up where they
should.  In my case, disklabel moved the swap and all the ext2fs partitions
slightly, and I add to adjust them manually...

Once the disklabel is written to disk, the installation proceeds as usual.

Booting
-------
First time I booted my system back, I did not get into linux... I forgot
I had installed lilo in the master boot block, and lilo does not heed
the active partition flag. Fix was rather simple though. Once I was into
linux, I just had to edit lilo.conf to read:

boot=/dev/hda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50
image=/boot/myvmlinuz
	label=linux
	root=/dev/hda2
	vga=4
	read-only
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.0.34-1
	label=redhat
	root=/dev/hda2
	read-only
other=/dev/hda1
	label=dos
	table=/dev/hda
other=/dev/hda3
	label=obsd
	table=/dev/hda

(changed were the last 3 lines) and rerun lilo, and voila, 
OpenBSD was able to boot !

Linux and OpenBSD partitions
----------------------------
As of 2.0.35/2.1.122, linux does not support OpenBSD partitions. The way
the linux kernel works is reasonably straightforward, code in
drivers/block/genhd.c: when it detects a BSD disklabel, it does read it
and instantiates some new partitions, that will show up in that drive's
partition list. Unfortunately, that check is hardcoded for type A5
(NetBSD/FreeBSD) disklabel, and it recognizes only 8 partitions disklabels
anyway.

Just hacking the linux code to recognize A6 is not quite enough.  You also
need to trim down the resulting list of partitions, as your ext2fs
partitions will now show up twice !
I'm currently trying to implement some smart recognition scheme, where
the bsd disklabel would appear AFTER linux partitions, and where native
linux partitions wouldn't show up as duplicates in the disklabel.

You also need a working ufs, such as
<ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/ALPHA/ufs/u2fs-0.4.3.tar.gz>
Usually, the patch must be done manually so that the new module will
compile.

Binary compatibility
