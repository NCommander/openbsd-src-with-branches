Initial test versions of a OpenBSD/sparc binaries install are available
at
	ftp.openbsd.org:/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/sparc
Some mirror sites may take a day or two to catch up.

The OpenBSD/sparc port runs on sun4c class machines, ie. the
SS 1, 1+, 2, IPC, IPX, SLC, and ELC. it does not run on the
server-series machines, or the SS10-series machines.

The ftp directory contains a number of very large .tar.gz files in there,
as well as this document and a helper install script.

NOTE: THESE INSTRUCTIONS MAY CHANGE WITH EACH SNAPSHOT.

Until there are better instructions written, here's a rough idea:

1.  format and partition the disk using sunos. yup, OpenBSD/sparc uses
    sunos disk labels. i am running a quantum 105 with these partition
    sizes:
    a:    28140        0    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl.    0 - 133)
    b:    16170    28140    unused        0     0         # (Cyl.  134 - 210)
    c:   204540        0    unused        0     0         # (Cyl.    0 - 973)
    g:   160230    44310    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl.  211 - 973)

    Filesystem               512-blocks    Used   Avail Capacity  Mounted on
    /dev/sd0a              26090   18846    4634    80%    /
    /dev/sd0g             149444  131496    3002    98%    /usr
    amd:43                     0       0       0   100%    /home
    gecko:/usr/src       1549722  851783  542966    61%    /usr/src
    komodo:/usr/local     269346  243428   -1016   100%    /usr/local
    newt:/newt.usera     1128328  836910  178584    82%    /tmp_mnt/newt/newt.usera

2.  newfs it using sunos. yup, the filesystem format is identical.
    UFS hasn't changed much over the years. (If you can, there is
    a performance benefit from newfs'ing using OpenBSD.)

    If you newfs using the OpenBSD newfs command, be sure to use -O
    to specify the `4.3BSD filesystem format' for your / partition,
    otherwise you will not be able to boot. The SunOS boot blocks do
    not understand the extended 4.4 filesystem format.

3.  put a SunOS /boot program in the root partition, and use
    "installboot" to cause it to work. the "installboot" man page
    says to do something like this: say you are running SunOS, and
    the drive you are installing OpenBSD/sparc on is currently at
    /dev/sd1. You have made the filesystems on that drive already.
	# mount /dev/sd1a /mnt
	# cp /boot /mnt/boot
	# /usr/mdec/installboot -vlt /mnt/boot /usr/mdec/bootsd /dev/rsd1a

4.  extract the provided *.tar.gz files onto the disk. the file
    "install.sh" will help you do this.

    mount your partition(s) in a proper tree starting at /mnt. In the
    same directory as your *.tar.gz files are, run "./install.sh".
    (Now you may cut the head off the chicken and spray the blood over
    your walls and ceiling. :-)

5.  copy /mnt/etc/fstab.sd to /mnt/etc/fstab and edit to match your
    disk layout.

6.  the install script copies the kernel called "bsd.scsi3" to
    /mnt/bsd. Two sample kernels are supplied: "bsd" and
    "bsd.scsi3".

    Unlike SunOS and the ROM, OpenBSD numbers scsi drives sequentially
    as it finds them. The drive with the lowest scsi-id will be called
    sd0.  SunOS and the ROM map normally map sd0 to scsi-id 3. Thus, if
    you have two drives, it's quite likely that OpenBSD will disagree with
    the ROM.

    The "bsd.scsi3" kernel gets around this problem, by hard-wiring
    scsi-id#3 to sd0. The remaining drives will be dynamically mapped
    to other sd* numbers.  If you have more than one drive you will
    want to use this kernel.

    the "bsd" kernel expects your root drive to be at the standard
    SunOS sd0==scsi-id#3 location. If you have a second drive at any
    of scsi-id's 0, 1, or 2, this kernel will NOT work for you. If you
    know what you are doing, you could use this kernel.

7.  your ROM may need some setup. make sure you boot from `new command mode'.
    If your machine comes up and gives you a `>' prompt instead of `ok', type:
        >n
        ok setenv sunmon-compat? false
        ok
    this is needed because bsd cannot handle the old-mode yet,
    and will firework on you.

    you cannot use the security modes of the sparc ROM. sorry, same
    problem as above.
	ok setenv security-mode none

8.  if needed, swap your scsi id's. now try a reboot. initially I'd
    suggest you boot "-bs", then try multiuser after that. if you boot
    single-user the bsd incantation for making root read-write
    is "mount -u /dev/sd0a /". alternatively, the command reboot is
    found in /sbin.

9.  to boot from bsd by default, tell something like this to your
    ROM.
	>n
	ok setenv boot-from sd(0,0,0)bsd
	ok

please let me know of any errors in these instructions or in the
archives. if so i'll correct them.

good luck.
