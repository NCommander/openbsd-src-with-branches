Notes about the contents of the /etc/kerberosIV directory:

(please check /usr/share/info for more information about kerberos)

The file master_key contains a copy of the master key under which the
entire Kerberos database is encrypted.  Disclosing this key would be bad
news.  The reason it is stored in the filesystem is because the following
programs need to inspect or modify the kereros database, and so the key
must be available for them, (or else it would have to be typed in by
hand):
		- kerberos (the server itself)
		- kpasswdd (for changing passwords)
		- kadmind (database administration server)

The srvtab file contains the encryption keys for each service on the local
host.  Any host offering network services would have a key here, although
many such files can be used.

The principal.* files comprise the Kerberos database itself, and contain
keys for all principles, and should not be world-readable.

The krb.conf file contains the configuration for this machine:
1) which realm I'm in
   if this line begins with '#', kerberos is disabled system-wide.
2) which servers I should talk to for _this_ realm
3) which servers I should talk to for the following realms.

The krb.realms file contains the name of Kerberos servers for
various (sub)domains.

Kerberos log information it placed in /var/log/kerberos.log
(see /etc/rc to change it)
