# First, we define a global entry which specifies the stuff every host uses.

        :hd=/home/nfsclient:bf=null:\
        :ds=128.32.149.141:\

        :ts=0x80020b4d 0x80020ffd:\

# Next, we can define different master entries for each subnet. . .

#subnet13.dummy:\

#
# We should be able to use as many levels of indirection as desired.  Use
# your imagination. . .

# Individual entries (could also have different servers for some/all of these
# hosts, but we don't really use this feature at CMU):
