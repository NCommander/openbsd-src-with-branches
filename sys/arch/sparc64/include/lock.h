/*
 * On processors with multiple threads we force a thread switch.
 *
 * On UltraSPARC T2 and its successors, the optimal way to do this
 * seems to be to do three nop reads of %ccr.  This works on
 * UltraSPARC T1 as well, even though three nop casx operations seem
 * to be slightly more optimal.  Since these instructions are
 * effectively nops, executing them on earlier non-CMT processors is
 * harmless, so we make this the default.
 *
 * On SPARC T4 and later, we can use the processor-specific pause
 * instruction.
 *
 * On SPARC64 VI and its successors we execute the processor-specific
 * sleep instruction.
