# Config.new file and device description for machine-independent PCMCIA code.
# Included by ports that need it.

# XXX Does this comment hold?
# ports should define their own "device pcmcia" line (like the one below,
# but with the correct bus attachment).

#
# needs all the parameters available on isa, so devices can attach here.

device pcmcia  {[port = -1], [size = 0],
		[iomem = -1], [iosiz = 0],
		[irq = -1], [drq = -1], [slot = -1]}
