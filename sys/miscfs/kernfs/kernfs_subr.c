 * allocate a kernfs_node/vnode pair.  the vnode is
 * referenced, but not locked.
 *
 * type, and mount point uniquely
 * identify a kfsnode.  the mount point is needed
 * because someone might mount this filesystem
 * twice.
 *
 * all kfsnodes are maintained on a singly-linked
 * list.  new nodes are only allocated when they cannot
 * be found on this list.  entries on the list are
 * removed when the vfs reclaim entry is called.
 *
 * a single lock is kept for the entire list.  this is
 * needed because the getnewvnode() function can block
 * waiting for a vnode to become free, in which case there
 * may be more than one process trying to get the same
 * vnode.  this lock is only taken if we are going to
 * call getnewvnode, since the kernel itself is single-threaded.
 *
 * if an entry is found on the list, then call vget() to
 * take a reference.  this is done because there may be
 * zero references to it and so it needs to removed from
 * the vnode free list.
