.Dt LOGIN_YUBIKEY 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm login_yubikey
.Nd provide Yubikey authentication type
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm login_yubikey
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl s Ar service
.Ar user
.Op Ar class
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is called by
.Xr login 1 ,
.Xr su 1 ,
.Xr ftpd 8 ,
and others to authenticate the
.Ar user
with Yubikey authentication.
.Pp
The
.Ar service
argument specifies which protocol to use with the
invoking program.
The allowed protocols are
.Em login ,
.Em challenge ,
and
.Em response .
The default protocol is
.Em login .
.Pp
The
.Ar user
argument is the login name of the user to be authenticated.
.Pp
The optional
.Ar class
argument is accepted for consistency with the other login scripts but
is not used.
.Pp
.Nm
will read the user's uid (12 hex digits) from the file
.Em user.uid ,
the user's key (32 hex digits) from
.Em user.key ,
and the user's last-use counter from
.Em user.cnt
in the
.Em /var/db/yubikey
directory.
.Pp
If
.Ar user
does not have a uid or key, the login is rejected.
If
.Ar user
does not have a last-use counter, a value of zero is used and
any counter is accepted during the first login.
.Pp
The one-time password provided by the user is decrypted using the
user's key.
After the decryption, the checksum embedded in the one-time password
is verified.
If the checksum is not valid, the login is rejected.
.Pp
If the checksum is valid, the uid embedded in the one-time password
is compared against the user's uid.
If the uid does not match, the login is rejected.
.Pp
If the uid matches, the use counter embedded in the one-time password
is compared to the last-use counter.
If the counter is less than or equal to the last-use counter, the
login is rejected.
This indicates a replay attack.
.Pp
If the counter is larger than the last-use counter, the counter
is stored as the new last-use counter, and the login is accepted.
