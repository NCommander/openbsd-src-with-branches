or
.Dv SIGHUP
is received.
Additionally, the superuser may specify the name of a user in order
to lock a different mailbox.

is able to create the lock file,
.Dq 1
is written to stdout, otherwise
.Dq 0
is written and an error message is written to stderr.

will try up to 10 times to get the lock (sleeping
for a short period in between tries).

The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and 1 if an error occurs.
