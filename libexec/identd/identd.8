.Dt IDENTD 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm identd
.Nd TCP/IP IDENT protocol server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm identd
.Op Fl i | w | b
.Op Fl t Ar seconds
.Op Fl u Ar uid
.Op Fl g Ar gid
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Op Fl a Ar address
.Op Fl c Ar charset
.Op Fl noelvmNUdh
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a server which implements the
.Tn TCP/IP
proposed standard
.Tn IDENT
user identification protocol as specified in the
.Tn RFC 1413
document.
.Pp
.Nm
operates by looking up specific
.Tn TCP/IP
connections and returning the user name of the
process owning the connection.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i
Tells
.Nm identd
to run as a process started from
.Xr inetd 8
with the "nowait" option in the
.Pa /etc/inetd.conf
file.
Use of this mode will make
.Xr inetd 8
start one
.Nm
daemon for each connection request.
This is the default mode of operation.
.It Fl w
Tells
.Nm identd
to run as a process started from
.Xr inetd 8
with the "wait" option in the
.Pa /etc/inetd.conf
file.
This mode of operation will start a copy of
.Nm
at the first connection request and then
.Nm
will handle subsequent requests.
Previous versions listed this as the preferred mode of
operation due to the initial overhead of parsing the kernel nlist.
This version does not use kmem or nlist parsing, so this reasoning
is no longer valid.
.It Fl b
Specify operation as a stand alone daemon.
.It Fl h
Hide the actual information about the user by providing an opaque
token instead.
This token is entered into the local system logs
so that the administrator can later discover who the real user was.
.It Fl H
Hide information about non existing users (e.g., connections through NAT) as
well as existing users. 
Implies 
.Fl h .
.It Fl t Ar seconds
Specifies an idle timeout in seconds where a daemon running in
"wait" mode will timeout and exit.
The default is no timeout.
.It Fl u Ar uid
Specify a user ID number or user name which the
.Nm identd
server should
switch to after binding itself to the
.Tn TCP/IP
port if running as a stand alone daemon.
.It Fl g Ar gid
Specify a group ID number or group name which the
.Nm
server should
switch to after binding itself to the
.Tn TCP/IP
port if running as a stand alone daemon
.It Fl p Ar port
Specify an alternative port number or service name
on which to listen when running as a stand alone daemon
Default is "auth" (113).
.It Fl a Ar address
Specify a local IP address in dotted quad format
to bind the listen socket to if running as a standalone daemon.
By default the daemon listens on all local IP addresses.
.It Fl l
Use
.Xr syslogd 8
for logging purposes.
.It Fl v
Log every request to syslog if
.Fl l
above is specified.
.It Fl o
Do not reveal operating system type;
always return
.Dq OTHER
instead.
.It Fl e
Always return
.Dq UNKNOWN-ERROR
instead of the
.Dq NO-USER
or
.Dq INVALID-PORT
errors.
.It Fl c Ar charset
Specify an optional character set designator to be included in replies.
.Ar charset
should be a valid character set as described in the
.Tn MIME RFC
in upper case characters.
.It Fl n
Always return uid numbers instead of usernames.
.It Fl N
When replying with a user name or ID, first
check for a file
.Pa .noident
in the user's home directory.
If this file is accessible, return
.Dq HIDDEN-USER
instead of the normal USERID response.
.It Fl U
When replying with a user name or ID, first
check for a file
.Pa .ident
in the user's home directory.
If this file is accessible, return
the contents of the file 
instead of the normal USERID response.
.It Fl m
Allow multiple requests to be processed per session.
Each request is specified one per line and the responses will be returned
one per line.
The connection will not be closed until the client closes its end of
the connection.
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS MODE VIOLATES THE PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION AS
IT CURRENTLY STANDS.
.It Fl d
This flag enables some debugging code that normally should NOT
be enabled since that breaks the protocol and may reveal information
that should not be available to outsiders.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr inetd.conf 5
.Sh NOTES
.Nm
uses the
.Li LOG_DAEMON
.Xr syslogd 8
facility to log messages.
.Pp
Unlike previous versions of
.Nm identd ,
this version uses
.Xr sysctl 3
to obtain information from the kernel instead of parsing kmem.
This version does not require privilege beyond what is needed to bind
the listen port if running as a standalone daemon.
.Sh BUGS
Since
.Nm identd
should typically not be run as a privileged user or group,
.Pa .ident
files for use when running with the
.Fl U
flag will need to be world accessible.
The same applies for
.Pa .noident
files when running with the 
.Fl N
flag.
