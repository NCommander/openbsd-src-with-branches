.Dt TCPDMATCH 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
tcpdmatch \- tcp wrapper oracle
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tcpdmatch
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl i Ar inet_conf
.Ar daemon
.Ar client
.Pp
.Nm tcpdmatch
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl i Ar inet_conf
.Ar daemon Op Ar @server
.Op Ar user@
.Ar client
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
predicts how the tcp wrapper would handle a specific request for service.
Examples are given below.
.Pp
The program examines the
.Xr tcpd 8
access control tables (default
.Pa /etc/hosts.allow
and
.Pa /etc/hosts.deny )
and prints its conclusion.
For maximal accuracy, it extracts additional information from your
.Xr inetd 8
network configuration file.
.Pp
When
.Nm
finds a match in the access control tables, it identifies the matched rule.
In addition, it displays the optional
shell commands or options in a pretty-printed format; this makes it
easier for you to spot any discrepancies between what you want and what
the program understands.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXXXX
.It Fl d
Examine
.Pa hosts.allow
and
.Pa hosts.deny
files in the current directory instead of the default ones.
.It Fl i Ar inet_conf
Specify this option when
.Nm
is unable to find your
.Pa inetd.conf
network configuration file, or when you wish to test with a non-default one.
.El
.Pp
The following two arguments are always required:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXX -compact
.It Ar daemon
A daemon process name.
Typically, the last component of a daemon executable pathname.
.It Ar client
A host name or network address, or one of the
.Dq unknown
or
.Dq paranoid
wildcard patterns.
.El
.Pp
When a client host name is specified,
.Nm
gives a prediction for each address listed for that client.
.Pp
When a client address is specified,
.Nm
predicts what
.Xr tcpd 8
would do when client name lookup fails.
.Pp
Optional information specified with the
.Ar daemon@server
form:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXX -compact
.It Ar server
A host name or network address, or one of the
.Dq unknown
or
.Dq paranoid
wildcard patterns.
The default server name is
.Dq unknown .
.El
.Pp
Optional information specified with the
.Ar user@client
form:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXX -compact
.It Ar user
A client user identifier.
Typically, a login name or a numeric user ID.
The default user name is
.Dq unknown .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To predict how
.Xr tcpd 8
would handle a telnet request from the local system:
.Pp
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
tcpdmatch telnetd localhost
.Ed
.Pp
The same request, pretending that hostname lookup failed:
.Pp
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
tcpdmatch telnetd 127.0.0.1
.Ed
.Pp
To predict what
.Xr tcpd 8
would do when the client name does not match the client address:
.Pp
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
tcpdmatch telnetd paranoid
.Ed
.\" .Pp
.\" On some systems, daemon names have no `in.' prefix, or
.\" .Nm tcpdmatch\
.\" may need some help to locate the inetd configuration file.
.Sh FILES
The default locations of the
.Xr tcpd 8
access control tables are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width /etc/hosts.allow -compact
.It Pa /etc/hosts.allow
access control table (allow list)
.It Pa /etc/hosts.deny
access control table (deny list)
.El
