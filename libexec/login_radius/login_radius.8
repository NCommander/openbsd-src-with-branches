.Sh NAME
.Nm login_radius
.Nd contact radiusd for authentication
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm login_radius
.Op Fl s Ar service
.Op Fl v Ar name=value
.Ar user
.Op Ar class
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility contacts the
.Xr radiusd 8
daemon to authenticate a user.
When executed as the name
.Pa login_ Ns Ar style
it will request
.Xr radiusd 8
to use the authentication specified by
.Xr style .
.Pp
Available options are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl s
Specify the service.
Currently only
.Li challenge ,
.Li login ,
and
.Li response
are supported.
.It Fl v
This option and its value are ignored.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility needs to know a shared secret for each radius server it talks to.
Shared secrets are stored in the file
.Pa /etc/raddb/servers
with the format:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
server shared_secret
.Ed
.Pp
The primary and possible secondary radius servers are defined in the
.Xr login.conf 5
file by the fields:
.Li radius-server
and
.Li radius-server-alt .
.Pp
It is expected that rather than requesting the radius style directly
(in which case the
.Xr radiusd 8
server uses a default style)
that
.Nm
will be linked to the various mechanisms desired.
For instance, to have all CRYPTOCard and ActivCard authentication take
place on a remote server via the radius protocol, remove the
.Pa login_activ
and
.Pa login_crypto
modules and link
.Pa login_radius
to both of those names.
Now when the user requests one of those authentication styles,
.Nm
will automatically forward the request to the remote
.Xr radiusd 8
and request it do the requested style of authentication.
.Pp
Unless the the style being used is listed in the
.Li radius-challenge-styles
entry of the
.Pa /etc/login.conf
file, a password will be requested before sending the request to the
radius server.
