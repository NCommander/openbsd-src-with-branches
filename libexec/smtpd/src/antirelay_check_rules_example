# If we have NS_MATCH=1 compiled in, we can do it this way, by allowing
# the relay mail outbound from hosts that have dns.my.domain as one of
# their nameservers. this might be useful if we sit in front of a 
# lot of domains.
allow:NS=dns.my.domain:ALL:ALL
# alternatively, if we don't want to use NS_MATCH, we can simply allow 
# all hosts ending in my.domain to relay through me.
allow:*my.domain:ALL:ALL

# If we have NS_MATCH=1 compiled in, we can again, match on the nameserver
# accepting mail for any address where the RHS uses us as a nameserver.

# punt anything else, we won't relay for people we don't know.
