Who: Julian Assange, proff@suburbia.net
What: Nice fix to make smtpd check the message headers for long lines or
      unprintables, umask sanity setting at start.

Who: matt@uts.edu.au
What: Catch dumb Voyager-esque parenthesis placement bug, thereby fixing 
      the possiblilty of a lockf() call failing unnoticed in smtpd.

Who: Bill Warner, lww@ictech.com
What: Noticed, and let us fix the pathological cases of:
      1) smtpd being blasted in mid-message by a machine reboot leaving
      perpetually incomplete spool files in the directory.
      2) smtpd used to send the "250 ok" message to the remote client
      *before* successfully closing the spool file, so the message 
      could fail even though the client was told it worked.

Who: Bill Warner, lww@ictech.com
What:	Fix body detection in message header check. Smtpd was checking message
        entire message body for long lines.

Who: Andre Albsmeier, Andre.Albsmeier@mchp.siemens.de
What: 	Notice that the Makefile and code incorrectly enforced that 
	MAXARGSS had to be at least 6, when it really only needed to be
	at least 5. Also submitted the smtpfilter.c filter in the 
	contrib directory.

Who: Andre Albsmeier, Andre.Albsmeier@mchp.siemens.de
What: 	Fix optarg/optind declaration for SunOS.  Take note of EX_NOUSER
        case as more banal than other sendmail failure modes.

Who: Brett Hawn, blh@draconia.com
What:  Noticed Netscape Communicator EHLO braindeath and some characters
       like "+" which smtp_cleanitup was munching in addresses that it
       really shouldn't.  	 	
	
Who: Marcus Schwartz, marcus@schwartz.org
What: The SPOOLDIR makefile options to allow for creating the spool
      dir away from the top level chroot. Also the NO_COMMAND_LINE_OPTIONS
      in case you want to ensure smtpd is always run with the options 
      you compiled into it.

Who: Brett Hawn and Marcus Schwartz
What: Submitting patches for several different forms of address checking
      that never made it in, but served to convince me that people might
      actually need or want the type of address checking functionality
      now going in to 2.0.

Who: Eduardo Egues <eddie@mail.infocom.etecsa.cu>
What: Bug fix (broken check rules) in smtpd-2.0b2

Who: Pedro Vazquez <vazquez@IQM.Unicamp.BR>
What: Testing and suggesting Localization stuff, Much good e-mail 
      discussion, suggesting Paranoid mode split into PARANOID_DNS
      and PARANOID_SMTP

Who: Spamford Wallace <wallace@cyberpromo.com>
What:  SPAM Ticking me off enough to make me write the NS=stuff so I didn't
       have to maintain a huge list of all his domains/customers. Also
       provides nice "Subscribe Me to get more spam NOW" button on web
       site. Very convenient for testing.

Who: Andreas Borchert <borchert@mathematik.uni-ulm.de>
What: Noticed the forward/reverse name comparison in smtpd was incorrect 
      in smtpd 2.0b6 (and previous). Changed to use strcasecmp to compare
      case insensitively as it should be.

Who: Andrew Foster <adf@fl.net.au> 
What: Suggestion for regular expresssions and configurable messages. 
      and testing of the same.

Who: Matthew Tolle <matt@primenet.com>
What: Caught bug in 2.0 beta 6 - smtpd would SEGV if you were using the
      USER special and the connecting host didn't do ident!

Who: Terry Echiverri (terry@nol.net)
What: smtpfwdd not using LOG_FACILITY from makefile in beta 7. Much
      helpful discussion.

Who: Pauline van Winsen <Pauline.van.Winsen@uniq.com.au>
What: Caught Bug where smtpd would treat dn_expand failure in expanding 
      an NS or MX record too seriously - as a syscall failure allowing message.

Who D'Arcy J.M. Cain <darcy@druid.net>
What: bug where KNOWN hosts weren't being matched. Noticed problem with
      daemon mode children re-opening logs inside chroot, were logs might
      not work depending on how we have set up the chroot hole. gave me
      most of the -L option to allow people to bypass this problem.

Who: Cy Schubert <cschuber@uumail.gov.bc.ca>
What: Add -P option to smtpfwdd to change the poll time on the command line.

Who: D'Arcy J.M. Cain <darcy@druid.net>
What: Add "debug" rule to rules file, useful for debugging expermental rules.

Who: Henning P. Schmiedehausen <hps@tanstaafl.de>
What: Caught bug: was missing the skipover of the priority
      in grokking MX records. 

Who: Peter Marelas <maral@phase-one.com.au>
What: Caught bug, smtpd leaked fd's from address_check.c - could run out
      of fd's on a message with lots of recipients.

Who: Simon J. Gerraty <sjg@quick.com.au>
What: Noticed sendmail needing -oiTrue to handle lonesome "." on line by
      itself properly. Sigh. 

Who: Mark Seiden  <mis@seiden.com>
What: Bug where smtpd wouldn't catch sigpipe if client goes away while
      sending message body - could make smtpd exit and leave an incomplete
      spool file sitting in the spool dir. 

Who: Simon J. Gerraty <sjg@quick.com.au>
What: Contributed new -q logging format and fixes for spaces within
      quoted local-part so smtpd doesn't smack X400 messages.

Who: Henning P. Schmiedehausen <hps@tanstaafl.de>
What: Contributed -l option to allow for smtpd to be restricted to
      answering on only one address on a box with many addresses.
