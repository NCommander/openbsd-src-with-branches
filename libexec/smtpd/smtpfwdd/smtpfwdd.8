Obtuse Systems SMTPFWDD message forwarding daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm smtpfwdd

.Op Fl d Ar spooldir
.Op Fl u Ar user
.Op Fl g Ar group
.Op Fl s Ar mailprog
.Op Fl M Ar maxchildren
.Op Fl P Ar poll time
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm smtpfwdd
daemon forwards mail messages from a spool directory to
their eventual destinations. It regularly scans the spool directory in
which its symboitic companion program 
.Xr smtpd 8
stores messages and invokes
a mail program (such as 
.Xr sendmail 8 )
to forward them. It is the forward
portion of an SMTP store and foward proxy. 
.Nm smtpfwdd
is a standalone daemon, usually invoked at system startup.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Specify a different spool
.Ar directory .
This should be the same directory in which smtpd is spooling files.
(usually
.Pa /var/spool/smtpd )
.It Fl u
Specify a 
.Ar user
to run as. This user must not be root but
should normally be a user that is able to run 
.Xr sendmail 8
and use the -f option to specify the sender of a mail message.
.It Fl g
Specify a 
.Ar group
to run as. Same as user above.
.It Fl s
Specify a different mail program to use to forward
mail. The default is 
.Pa /usr/sbin/sendmail
Any replacement must be able to be invoked in the same manner as sendmail
with a -f fromaddress, followed by one or more destination addresses
on the command line.
.It Fl M
Specifies 
.Ar maxchildren
as the maximum number of children smtpfwdd should be
allowed to spawn at once when delivering mail. Default is 10
.It Fl P
specifies a polling interval of
.Ar polltime
seconds indicating how often the master smtpfwdd process
should wake up and check the spool directory for new mail
to forward. Default is 10 seconds.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr smtpd 8 ,
.Xr sendmail 8 ,
.Xr inetd 8
.Sh BUGS
Since 
.Xr sendmail 8
is not normally running as a daemon when using smtpd and
smtpfwdd, one must use cron to periodically invoke sendmail -q so that
queued messages are retried for eventual delivery, alternatively sendmail
may be run standalone, but not listening to the network if your version
of sendmail supports doing this correctly.
.Pp
There are many different variations of sendmail. smtpfwdd will check
and pay attention to the exit status of the sendmail processes it
invokes, possibly retrying an invocation of sendmail. If you aren't
using real unadulterated Berkeley sendmail of a recent vintage, you may
need to disable the exit status checking at compile time (See option
SENDMAIL_RETRY in the makefile).
.Pp
sendmail can't handle a . on one line in a message body. This problem
is bypassed in smtpfwdd by giving sendmail the option -oitrue. Again,
if you aren't using genuine sendmail, you may need to disable this at
compile time (see option SENDMAIL_OITRUE in the makefile).
