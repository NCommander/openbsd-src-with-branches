NAME
  xnlock - amusing lock screen program with message for passers-by

SYNOPSIS
  xxnnlloocckk [ _o_p_t_i_o_n_s ] [ _m_e_s_s_a_g_e ]

DESCRIPTION
  _x_n_l_o_c_k is a program that acts as a screen saver for workstations running
  X11.  It also "locks" the screen such that the workstation can be left
  unattended without worry that someone else will walk up to it and mess
  everything up.  When _x_n_l_o_c_k is running, a little man with a big nose and a
  hat runs around spewing out messages to the screen.  By default, the mes-
  sages are "humorous", but that depends on your sense of humor.

  If a key or mouse button is pressed, a prompt is printed requesting the
  user's password.  If a RETURN is not typed within 30 seconds, the little
  man resumes running around.

  Text on the command line is used as the message.  For example:
          % xnlock I'm out to lunch for a couple of hours.
  Note the need to quote shell metacharacters.

  In the absence of flags or text, _x_n_l_o_c_k displays random fortunes.

OPTIONS
  Command line options override all resource specifications.  All arguments
  that are not associated with a command line option is taken to be message
  text that the little man will "say" every once in a while.  The resource
  xxnnlloocckk..tteexxtt may be set to a string.

  --ffnn _f_o_n_t_n_a_m_e
       The default font is the first 18 point font in the _n_e_w _c_e_n_t_u_r_y _s_c_h_o_o_l_-
       _b_o_o_k family.  While larger fonts are recokmmended over smaller ones,
       any font in the server's font list will work.  The resource to use for
       this option is xxnnlloocckk..ffoonntt.

  --ffiilleennaammee  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
       Take the message to be displayed from the file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  If _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
       is not specified, _$_H_O_M_E_/_._m_s_g_f_i_l_e is used.  If the contents of the file
       are changed during runtime, the most recent text of the file is used
       (allowing the displayed message to be altered remotely).  Carriage
       returns within the text are allowed, but tabs or other control charac-
       ters are not translated and should not be used.  The resource avail-
       able for this option is xxnnlloocckk..ffiillee.

  --aarr  Accept root's password to unlock screen.  This option is true by
       default.  The reason for this is so that someone's screen may be
       unlocked by autorized users in case of emergency and the person run-
       ning the program is still out to lunch.  The resource available for
       specifying this option is xxnnlloocckk..aacccceeppttRRoooottPPaasssswwdd.

  --nnooaarr
       Don't accept root's password.  This option is for paranoids who fear
       their peers might breakin using root's password and remove their files
       anyway.  Specifying this option on the command line overrides the
       xxnnlloocckk..aacccceeppttRRoooottPPaasssswwdd if set to True.

  --iipp  Ignore password prompt.  The resource available for this option is
       xxnnlloocckk..iiggnnoorreePPaasssswwdd.

  --nnooiipp
       Don't ignore password prompt.  This is available in order to override
       the resource iiggnnoorreePPaasssswwdd if set to True.

  --ffgg _c_o_l_o_r
       Specifies the foreground color.  The resource available for this is
       xxnnlloocckk..ffoorreeggrroouunndd.

  --bbgg _c_o_l_o_r
       Specifies the background color.  The resource available for this is
       xxnnlloocckk..bbaacckkggrroouunndd.

  --rrvv  Reverse the foreground and background colors.  The resource for this
       is xxvvnnlloocckk..rreevveerrsseeVViiddeeoo.

  --nnoorrvv
       Don't use reverse video.  This is available to override the reverseV-
       ideo resource if set to True.

  --pprroogg _p_r_o_g_r_a_m
       Receive message text from the running program _p_r_o_g_r_a_m. If there are
       arguments to _p_r_o_g_r_a_m, encase them with the name of the program in
       quotes (e.g. xnlock -t "fortune -o").  The resource for this is
       xxnnlloocckk..pprrooggrraamm.
