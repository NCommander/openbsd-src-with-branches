DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) pro-
     vides security services to callers in a generic fashion, supportable with
     a range of underlying mechanisms and technologies and hence allowing
     source-level portability of applications to different environments.

     The HHeeiimmddaall GSS-API implementation had a bug in releases before 0.6 that
     made it fail to inter-operate when using DES3 with other GSS-API imple-
     mentations when using ggssss__ggeett__mmiicc() / ggssss__vveerriiffyy__mmiicc().  Its possible to
     modify the behavior of the generator of the MIC with the _k_r_b_5_._c_o_n_f con-
     figuration file so that old clients/servers will still work.

     New clients/servers will try both the old and new MIC in Heimdal 0.6.  In
     0.7 it will check only if configured and the compatibility code will be
     removed in 0.8.

     Heimdal 0.6 still generates by default the broken GSS-API DES3 mic, this
     will change in 0.7 to generate correct des3 mic.

     To turn on compatibility with older clients and servers, change the
     [[ggssssaappii]] _b_r_o_k_e_n___d_e_s_3___m_i_c in _k_r_b_5_._c_o_n_f that contains a list of globbing
     expressions that will be matched against the server name.  To turn off
     generation of the old (incompatible) mic of the MIC use [[ggssssaappii]]
     _c_o_r_r_e_c_t___d_e_s_3___m_i_c.

     If a match for a entry is in both [[ggssssaappii]] _c_o_r_r_e_c_t___d_e_s_3___m_i_c and [[ggssssaappii]]
     _c_o_r_r_e_c_t___d_e_s_3___m_i_c, the later will override.

     This config option modifies behaviour for both clients and servers.

     Example:

           [gssapi]
                   broken_des3_mic = cvs/*@SU.SE
                   broken_des3_mic = host/*@E.KTH.SE
                   correct_des3_mic = host/*@SU.SE

BBUUGGSS
     All of 0.5.x versions of hheeiimmddaall had broken token delegations in the
     client side, the server side was correct.
