DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The kkrrbb55..ccoonnff file specifies several configuration parameters for the
     Kerberos 5 library, as well as for some programs.

     The file consists of one or more sections, containing a number of bind-
     ings.  The value of each binding can be either a string or a list of oth-
     er bindings.  The grammar looks like:

           file:
                   /* empty */
                   sections

           sections:
                   section sections
                   section

           section:
                   '[' section_name ']' bindings

           section_name:
                   STRING

           bindings:
                   binding bindings
                   binding

           binding:
                   name '=' STRING
                   name '=' '{' bindings '}'

           name:
                   STRING

     STRINGs consists of one or more non-whitespace characters.

     STRINGs that are specified later in this man-page uses the following no-
     tation.

           boolean
                values can be either yes/true or no/false.

           time
                values can be a list of year, month, day, hour, min, second.
                Example: 1 month 2 days 30 min.

           etypes
                valid encryption types are: des-cbc-crc, des-cbc-md4, des-cbc-
                md5, des3-cbc-sha1, arcfour-hmac-md5, aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96,
                and aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 .

           address
                an address can be either a IPv4 or a IPv6 address.

     Currently recognised sections and bindings are:

           [appdefaults]
                Specifies the default values to be used for Kerberos applica-
                tions.  You can specify defaults per application, realm, or a

                combination of these.  The preference order is:
                1.   _a_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n _r_e_a_l_m _o_p_t_i_o_n
                2.   _a_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n _o_p_t_i_o_n
                3.   _r_e_a_l_m _o_p_t_i_o_n

                           [realms] section.

                      fcc-mit-ticketflags = _b_o_o_l_e_a_n

                           in reverse bit order for older than Heimdal 0.7.
                           Setting this flag to TRUE make it store the MIT
                           way, this is default for Heimdal 0.7.

           [domain_realm]
                This is a list of mappings from DNS domain to Kerberos realm.
                Each binding in this section looks like:

                      domain = realm

                The domain can be either a full name of a host or a trailing
                component, in the latter case the domain-string should start
                with a period.  The realm may be the token `dns_locate', in
                which case the actual realm will be determined using DNS (in-
                dependently of the setting of the `dns_lookup_realm' option).

                                      medium the kdc should be contacted.

                                      to ultimately obtain credentials for a

                                      it tells the KDC (and other servers)
                                      which realms are allowed in a multi-hop

     Since kkrrbb55..ccoonnff is read and parsed by the krb5 library, there is not a
     lot of opportunities for programs to report parsing errors in any useful
     format.  To help overcome this problem, there is a program
     vveerriiffyy__kkrrbb55__ccoonnff that reads kkrrbb55..ccoonnff and tries to emit useful diagnos-
     tics from parsing errors.  Note that this program does not have any way
     of knowing what options are actually used and thus cannot warn about un-
     known or misspelled ones.
