Documentation
=============

The 'heimdal' infopage has information about how to set up a Kerberos
realm etc. There are also a number of manpages with reference information.


BSD Auth
========

There's also a BSD Authentication login script in src/libexec/login_krb5,
that is used to enable Kerberos authentication in login, sshd, xdm etc.

Refer to login.conf(5), login(1), login_krb5(8) and login_krb5-or-pwd(8)
for more information on how to enable them.
