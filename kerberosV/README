Warning!

This is experimental stuff, don't expect things to work correctly at this
point. Please contact <hin@openbsd.org> if you have questions about the
kerberosV stuff.

To build this stuff, do the following:

# cd /usr/src/kerberosV
# make build

To get a telnet client and server with kerberos5 support, do the following:

# echo "KERBEROS5=Yes" >> /etc/mk.conf
# cd /usr/src/lib/libtelnet
# make ; make install
# cd /usr/src/usr.bin/telnet
# make ; make install
# cd /usr/src/libexec/telnetd
# make ; make install 



Things todo, in no particular order:

 - Make sure to not try krb5 auth when no ticket exists. (same goes for krb4)
 - kadmind
 - Other servers
 - ssh and sshd
 - Test what happens for a user not using kerberos
 - Test all combinations of compat stuff between client, kdc and server
 - Slave propagation k5->k5 and k4->k5
 - Test how to upgrade a realm from k4 to k5
 - Test compatibility with other k5 implementations, for example MIT and
   Windows 2000
 - Logging
