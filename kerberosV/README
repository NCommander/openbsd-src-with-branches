Warning
=======

This is experimental stuff, don't expect things to work correctly at this
point. Please contact <hin@openbsd.org> if you have questions about the
kerberosV stuff.


Status of the code
==================

The current status is that the libraries, KDC, kadmind, some basic
administrators and users utilities, and the telnet client and server works.


Building
========

To build this stuff, do the following:

# echo "KERBEROS5=Yes" >> /etc/mk.conf
# cd /usr/src/kerberosV
# make build

To get a telnet client and server with kerberos5 support, do the following:

# cd /usr/src/lib/libtelnet
# make ; make install
# cd /usr/src/usr.bin/telnet
# make ; make install
# cd /usr/src/libexec/telnetd
# make ; make install 


Documentation
=============

Some documentation is available in the `heimdal' info-page, but it is currently
quite incomplete. A number of manpages for library functions are also
available.


TODO
====

Things todo, in no particular order:

 - Make sure to not try krb5 auth when no ticket exists. (same goes for krb4)
   (i think this is actually ok, but it needs to be verified.)
 - hprop, iprop
 - kf, kfd
 - kpasswdd and hack krb5 support in our passwd
 - krb5-config script
 - kx, kxd
 - krb5 support in login, xdm, xlock, su and sudo
 - rxtelnet, rxterm
 - string2key
 - pop-server and push
 - rsh, rshd
 - ssh and sshd
 - Test what happens for a user not using kerberos
 - Test all combinations of compat stuff between client, kdc and server
 - Slave propagation k5->k5 and k4->k5
 - Test and document how to upgrade a realm from k4 to k5
 - Test compatibility with other k5 implementations, for example MIT and
   Windows 2000, and document any caveats or tricks
 - Logging
 - Manpages are missing for many library functions, as well as a few
   programs. So we should document them and give back to the Heimdal project.
 - Fix /etc/rc and companions
 - Example configuration installed when system is installed
