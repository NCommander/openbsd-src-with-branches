Status of the code
==================

This code is currently beta quality code, but seems to work quite well.
Heimdal is used by several large University and Commercial sites.


Documentation
=============

Some documentation is available in the `heimdal' info-page, but it is currently
quite incomplete. A number of manpages for library functions are also
available.


BSD Auth
========

There's also a BSD Authentication login script in src/libexec/login_krb5.

Refer to login.conf(5), login(1), login_krb5(8) and login_krb5-or-pwd(8)
for more information on how to enable them.


Testing
=======

(This is mainly a note to my self...)

- Do a full build on at least one elf and one a.out arch.
- Do a static build of at least the kerberosV directory on elf and a.out.
- Test basic stuff like kauth, klist, telnet and such.


TODO
====

Things todo, in no particular order:

 - Make sure to not try krb5 auth when no ticket exists. (same goes for krb4)
   (i think this is actually ok, but it needs to be verified.)
 - Password quality checks in kpasswdd
 - krb5-config script
 - kx, kxd
 - pop-server and push
 - rsh, rshd
 - Test what happens for a user not using kerberos
 - Test all combinations of compat stuff between client, kdc and server
 - Slave propagation k5->k5 and k4->k5
 - Test and document how to upgrade a realm from k4 to k5
 - Test compatibility with other k5 implementations, for example MIT and
   Windows 2000, and document any caveats or tricks
 - Logging
 - Manpages are missing for many library functions, as well as a few
   programs. So we should document them and give back to the Heimdal project.
 - GSS-API support in our ftp client and server
 - Figure out how to deal with kstash
