.Sh NAME
.Nm intro
.Nd introduction to the C libraries
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The manual pages in section 3 provide an overview of the C library 
functions, their error returns, and other common definitions and concepts.
Most of these functions are available from the C library,
.Em libc .
Other libraries, such as the math library,
.Em libm ,
must be indicated at compile time with the
.Fl l
option of the compiler.
.Pp
The various libraries (followed by the loader flag):
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It libc Pq Fl l Ns Ar c
Standard C library functions.
When using the C compiler
.Xr cc 1 ,
it is not necessary to supply the loader flag
.Fl l Ns Ar c
for these functions.
There are several
.Dq libraries
or groups of functions included inside of libc: the standard
.Tn I/O
routines,
database routines,
bit operators,
string operators,
character tests and character operators,
DES encryption routines,
storage allocation,
time functions,
signal handling,
and more.
.It libcurses Pq Fl l Ns Ar curses
Terminal independent screen management routines for two-dimensional
non-bitmap display terminals.
See
.Xr curses 3 .
.It libcompat Pq Fl l Ns Ar compat
Functions which are obsolete but are available for compatibility with
.Bx 4.3 .
In particular, a number of system call interfaces provided in previous
releases of
.Bx
have been included for source code compatibility.
Use of these routines should, for the most part, be avoided.
The manual page entry for each compatibility routine
indicates the proper interface to use.
.It libkvm Pq Fl l Ns Ar kvm
Kernel virtual interface library.
See
.Xr kvm 3 .
.It libl Pq Fl l Ns Ar l
The library for
.Xr lex 1 .
.It libm Pq Fl l Ns Ar m
The math library,
.Em libm .
See
.Xr math 3 .
.It libpthread Pq Ar -pthread
.St -p1003.1-01
threads (see
.Xr pthreads 3 )
API and thread scheduler.
Threaded applications should use
.Ar -pthread
not
.Fl l Ns Ar pthread .
.It libtermcap Pq Fl l Ns Ar termcap
The terminal independent operation library package.
(See
.Xr termcap 3 . )
