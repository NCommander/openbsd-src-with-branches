.Sh NAME
.Nm intro
.Nd introduction to the C libraries
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This section provides an overview of the C
library functions, their error returns and other
common definitions and concepts.
Most of these functions are available from the C library,
.Em libc .
Other libraries, such as the math library,
.Em libm ,
must be indicated at compile time with the
.Fl l
option of the compiler.
.Pp
The various libraries (followed by the loader flag):
.Bl -tag -width "libc (-lc)"
.It Xr libc Pq Fl l Ns Ar c
Standard C library functions.
When using the C compiler
.Xr cc 1 ,
it is not necessary
to supply the loader flag
.Fl l Ns Ar c
for these functions.
There are several
.Dq libraries
or groups of functions included inside of
.Xr libc : the standard
.Tn I/O
routines,
database routines,
bit operators,
string operators,
character tests and character operators,
des encryption routines,
storage allocation, time functions, signal handling and more.
.It Xr libc_r Pq Fl l Ns Ar c_r
Reentrant C library. Contains POSIX 1003.1c
.Xr pthreads 3
API and thread scheduler, as well as all of the functions
found in
.Xr libc .
.It Xr libcurses Pq Fl l Ns Ar curses
Terminal independent screen management routines
for two dimensional non-bitmap display terminals.
(See
.Xr curses 3 . )
.It Xr libcompat Pq Fl l Ns Ar compat
Functions which are obsolete but are available for compatibility with
.Bx 4.3 .
In particular,
a number of system call interfaces provided in previous releases of
.Bx
have been included for source code compatibility.
Use of these routines should, for the most part, be avoided.
The manual page entry for each compatibility routine
indicates the proper interface to use.
.It Xr libkvm Pq Fl l Ns Ar kvm
Kernel virtual interface library.  For more information, see
.Xr kvm 3 .
.It Xr libl Pq Fl l Ns Ar l
The library for
.Xr lex 1 .
.It Xr libm Pq Fl l Ns Ar m
The math library,
.Em libm .  See
.Xr math 3 .
.It Xr libtermcap Pq Fl l Ns Ar termcap
The terminal independent operation library package. (See
.Xr termcap 3 . )
