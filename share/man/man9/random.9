.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm add_mouse_randomness ,
.Nm add_tty_randomness ,
.Nm add_net_randomness ,
.Nm add_disk_randomness ,
.Nm add_audio_randomness
routines are used to
supply data for the random data source device for futher processing.
The processing involves calculating inter-event time delta and measurirg
entropy contained in the resulting delta-T, supplied in argument data
is just mixed into the pool and does not increase entropy counter.
.br
.Nm add_true_randomness
does not involve usuall timing calculations
and causes supplied data argument added to the entropy pool
increasing the entropy counter by 32 bits.
.br
.Nm add_timer_randomness
will not cause entropy counter to rise, it
is used to change the state of the pool periodically mostly
by meaning of timing random driver's operations.
.Pp
.Nm get_random_bytes
may be used to retrieve strong random data, just
as it would by
.Xr srandom 4
device.
.br
.Nm arc4random ,
.Nm arc4random_8
will give random 32 and 8 respectively bit numbers hashed with
the aRC4 algorithm, which appears to be faster and less abusive
to the entropy pool.
