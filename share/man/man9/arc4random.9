.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn add_mouse_randomness ,
.Fn add_tty_randomness ,
.Fn add_net_randomness ,
.Fn add_disk_randomness
and
.Fn add_audio_randomness
routines are used to
supply data for the random data source device for further processing.
The processing involves calculating inter-event timedelta and measuring
entropy contained in the resulting delta-T; the argument data supplied
is just mixed into the pool and does not increase the entropy counter.
.Pp
.Fn add_true_randomness
does not involve the usual timing calculations,
and causes the supplied data argument to be added to the entropy pool,
increasing the entropy counter by 32 bits.
.Pp
.Fn add_timer_randomness
will not cause the entropy counter to rise.
It is used to change the state of the pool periodically,
mostly by means of timing the random driver's operations.
.Pp
.Fn arc4random
and
.Fn arc4random_buf
provide random numbers.
They may be called safely in any kernel context.
.Pp
.Fn arc4random_uniform
will return a uniformly distributed random number less than
.Fa upper_bound ,
avoiding "modulo bias" when the upper bound is not a power of two.
