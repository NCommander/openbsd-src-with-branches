.Sh NAME
.Nm atomic_add_int ,
.Nm atomic_add_int_nv ,
.Nm atomic_add_long ,
.Nm atomic_add_long_nv
.Nd atomic addition operations
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/atomic.h
.Ft void
.Fn atomic_add_int "volatile unsigned int *p" "unsigned int v"
.Ft unsigned int
.Fn atomic_add_int_nv "volatile unsigned int *p" "unsigned int v"
.Ft void
.Fn atomic_add_long "volatile unsigned long *p" "unsigned long v"
.Ft unsigned long
.Fn atomic_add_long_nv "volatile unsigned long *p" "unsigned long v"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The atomic_add set of functions provide an interface for atomically
performing add and add-and-fetch operations with respect to interrupts
and multiple processors in the system.
.Pp
The value referenced by the pointer
.Fa p
is incremented by the value
.Fa v .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Nm atomic_add_int
and
.Nm atomic_add_long
perform the addition without returning any knowledge of the value at the
.Fa p .
.Pp
.Nm atomic_add_int_nv
and
.Nm atomic_add_long_nv
return the value at
.Fa p
after the addition was performed.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr atomic 9 ,
.Xr atomic_inc_int 9 ,
.Xr atomic_sub_int 9
.Sh HISTORY
The atomic_add functions first appeared in
.Ox 5.5 .
