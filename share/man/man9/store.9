.Pa base .
.It Fn susword
Stores a short word of data,
.Pa s ,
to the user-space address
.Pa base .
.It Fn suswintr
Stores a short word of data,
.Pa s ,
to the user-space address
.Pa base .
This function is safe to call during an interrupt context.
.It Fn suword
Stores a word of data,
.Pa l ,
to the user-space address
.Pa base .
