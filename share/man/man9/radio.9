.Sh NAME
.Nm radio
.Nd interface between low and high level radio drivers
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The radio device driver is divided into a high level,
hardware independent layer, and a low level hardware
dependent layer.
The interface between these is the
.Va radio_hw_if
structure.
.Bd -literal
struct radio_hw_if {
	int	(*open)(void *, int, int, struct proc *);
	int	(*close)(void *, int, int, struct proc *);
	int     (*get_info)(void *, struct radio_info *);
	int     (*set_info)(void *, struct radio_info *);
	int     (*search)(void *, int);
};

.Ed
.Pp

The high level radio driver attaches to the low level driver
when the latter calls
.Va radio_attach_mi .
This call should be
.Bd -literal
    void
    radio_attach_mi(rhwp, hdlp, dev)
	struct radio_hw_if *rhwp;
	void *hdlp;
	struct device *dev;
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Va radio_hw_if
struct is as shown above.
The
.Va hdlp
argument is a handle to some low level data structure.
It is sent as the first argument to all the functions in
.Va radio_hw_if
when the high level driver calls them.
.Va dev
is the device struct for the hardware device.
.Pp

The fields of
.Va radio_hw_if
are described in some more detail below.

.Bd -literal
int open (void *, int flags, int fmt, struct proc *p);
  Optional.
  Is called when the radio device is opened.
  Returns 0 on success, otherwise an error code.

int close (void *, int flags, int fmt, struct proc *p);
  Optional.
  Is called when the radio device is closed.
  Returns 0 on success, otherwise an error code.

int get_info (void *, struct radio_info *);
  Fill the radio_info struct.
  Returns 0 on success, otherwise an error code.

int set_info (void *, struct radio_info *);
  Set values from the radio_info struct.
  Returns 0 on success, otherwise an error code.

int search (void *, int);
  Returns 0 on success, otherwise an error code.
