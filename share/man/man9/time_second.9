.Sh NAME
.Nm time_second ,
.Nm time_uptime
.Nd system time variables
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Vt extern volatile time_t time_second;
.Vt extern volatile time_t time_uptime;
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Va time_second
variable is the system's
.Dq wall time
clock.
It is set at boot by
.Xr inittodr 9 ,
and is updated by the
.Xr settimeofday 2
system call and by periodic clock interrupts.
.Pp
The
.Va time_uptime
variable is a monotonically increasing system clock.
It is set at boot, and is updated by the periodic timer interrupt.
(It is not updated by
.Xr settimeofday 2 . )
.Pp
All of these variables contain times
expressed in seconds since midnight (0 hour),
January 1, 1970.
.Pp
Clock interrupts should be blocked when reading or writing
.Va time_second
or
.Va time_uptime ,
because those variables are updated by
.Xr hardclock 9 .
