.Sh NAME
.Nm atomic ,
.Nm atomic_setbits_int ,
.Nm atomic_clearbits_int
.Nd interface to perform atomic operations on data
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/atomic.h
.Ft void
.Fn atomic_setbits_int "unsigned int *p" "unsigned int b"
.Ft void
.Fn atomic_clearbits_int "unsigned int *p" "unsigned int b"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
set of functions provide an interface for changing data atomically with
respect to interrupts and multiple processors in the system.
.Pp
There are several sets of atomic memory operations available:
.Bl -tag -width "atomic_swap(9)" -offset indent
.It Xr atomic_add 9
These functions perform atomic addition operations.
.It Xr atomic_cas 9
These functions perform atomic compare-and-swap operations.
.It Xr atomic_dec 9
These functions perform atomic decrement operations.
.It Xr atomic_inc 9
These functions perform atomic increment operations.
.It Xr atomic_sub 9
These functions perform atomic subtraction operations.
.It Xr atomic_swap 9
These functions perform atomic swap operations.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn atomic_setbits_int
function sets the bits in
.Fa b
in the integer pointed to by
.Fa p .
It is equivalent to
.Bd -literal -offset indent
*p |= b;
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn atomic_clearbits_int
function clears the bits in
.Fa b
in the integer pointed to by
.Fa p .
It is equivalent to
.Bd -literal -offset indent
*p &= ~b;
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr atomic_add 9 ,
.Xr atomic_cas 9 ,
.Xr atomic_dec 9 ,
.Xr atomic_inc 9 ,
.Xr atomic_sub 9 ,
.Xr atomic_swap 9
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
functions first appeared in
.Ox 4.1 .
