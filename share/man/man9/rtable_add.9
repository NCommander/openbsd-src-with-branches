.It Fn rtable_add "u_int id"
Add routing table with ID of
.Fa id
to routing domain
.Fa 0 .
.It Fn rtable_exists "u_int id"
Return
.Fa 1
if routing table with ID
.Fa id
exists,
.Fa 0
otherwise.
.It Fn rtable_get "u_int id" "sa_family_t af"
Return the root node for the family
.Fa af 
of the routing table with ID of
.Fa id
if it exists, 
.Fa NULL
otherwise.
.It Fn rtable_l2 "u_int id"
Get the routing domain of routing table with ID of
.Fa id .
.It Fn rtable_l2set "u_int id" "u_int rdomain"
Place routing table with ID of
.Fa id
under the routing domain with ID of
.Fa rdomain .
