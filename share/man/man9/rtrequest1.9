.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn rtrequest1
function is used to add or remove routes from a specific routing table.
It takes the following arguments:
.Bl -tag -width rtableid
.It Fa req
One of the following actions to perform:
.Bl -tag -width RTM_RESOLVE -offset indent
.It Dv RTM_ADD
Add a route to a given routing table.
.It Dv RTM_DELETE
Remove a route from a given routing table.
In case of a cloning route, all its children are deleted.
.It Dv RTM_RESOLVE
Add a cloned route, based on the parent cloning route pointed by
.Fa rtp ,
to a given routing table.
.El
.It Fa info
Describes the route to add or remove.
.It Fa prio
Specifies the priority of the route described by
.Fa info .
If it is
.Dv 0
and the requested action is
.Dv RTM_ADD
then a default priority based on the priority of the associated
interface is chosen.
.It Fa rtp
Points to the cloning route if the action is
.Dv RTM_RESOLVE
or, if the action is
.Dv RTM_DELETE
and it is non-NULL, a pointer to the removed route is placed there.
In this case, the caller must take care of releasing the returned route by
calling
.Xr rtfree 9 .
.It Fa rtableid
The ID of the routing table to modify.
.El
.Sh CONTEXT
.Fn rtrequest1
can be called during autoconf, from process context, or from interrupt context.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn rtrequest1
may fail with:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Er -compact
.It Bq Er EAFNOSUPPORT
The routing table with ID of
.Fa rtableid
does not exist or it does not support the protocol specified in
.Fa info .
.It Bq Er ESRCH
No route corresponding to
.Fa info
could be found.
.It Bq Er ESRCH
Multipath route with no gateway provided in
.Fa info .
.It Bq Er ESRCH
The route could not be found in the routing table of ID
.Fa rtableid .
specified
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The route pointed by
.Fa rtp
is not valid or does not point to a cloning route in the
.Dv RTM_RESOLVE
case.
.It Bq Er EEXIST
Multipath route conflicts with existing multipath route.
.It Bq Er EEXIST
The route could not be entered into the routing table.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Space for MPLS protocol data could not be allocated.
.It Bq Er ENOBUFS
Space for a new route could not be allocated.
.It Bq Er ENETUNREACH
An interface address corresponding to the route described by
.Fa info
could not be found.
