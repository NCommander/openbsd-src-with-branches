.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
taskq
API provides a mechanism to defer work to a process context.
.Pp
.Fn taskq_create
allocates a taskq and a set of threads to be used to complete work
that would be inappropriate for the shared system taskq.
The
.Fa name
argument specifies the name of the kernel threads that are created
to service the work on the taskq.
.Fa nthreads
specifies the number of threads that will be created to handle the work.
.Fa ipl
specifies the highest interrupt protection level at which
.Fn task_add
and
.Fn task_del
will be called against the created taskq.
See
.Xr spl 9
for a list of the IPLs.
.Pp
.Fn taskq_destroy
causes the resources associated with a previously created taskq to be freed.
It will wait till all the tasks in the work queue are completed before
returning.
Calling
.Fn taskq_destroy
against the system taskq is an error and will lead to undefined
behaviour or a system fault.
.Pp
It is the responsibility of the caller to provide the
.Fn task_set ,
.Fn task_add ,
and
.Fn task_del
functions with pre-allocated task structures.
.Pp
.Fn task_set
prepares the task structure
.Fa t
to be used in future calls to
.Fn task_add
and
.Fn task_del .
.Fa t
will be prepared to call the function
.Fa fn
with the arguments specified by
.Fa arg1
and
.Fa arg2 .
Once initialised, the
.Fa t
structure can be used repeatedly in calls to
.Fn task_add
and
.Fn task_del
and does not need to be reinitialised unless the function called
and/or its argument must change.
.Pp
.Fn task_add
schedules the execution of the work specified by the
task structure
.Fa t
on the
.Fa tq
taskq.
The task structure must already be initialised by
.Fn task_set .
.Pp
.Fn task_del
will remove the task structure
.Fa t
from the taskq
.Fa tq .
If the work was already executed or has not been added to the taskq,
the call will have no effect.
Calling
.Fn task_del
against a different taskq than the one given in a previous call to
.Fn task_add
is an error and will lead to undefined behaviour.
.Pp
The kernel provides two system taskqs:
.Va systq ,
which executes while holding the kernel lock, and
.Va systqmp ,
which does not hold the kernel lock during execution.
They can both be used by any subsystem for short lived tasks.
They are serviced by a single thread and can therefore provide predictable
ordering of work.
Work can be scheduled on the system taskqs from callers at or below IPL_HIGH.
.Pp
A task declaration can be initialised with the
.Fn TASK_INITIALIZER
macro.
The task will be prepared to call the function specified by the
.Fa fn
argument with the
.Fa void *
arguments given in
.Fa arg1
and
.Fa arg2 .
.Sh CONTEXT
.Fn taskq_create
and
.Fn taskq_destroy
can be called during autoconf, or from process context.
.Fn task_set ,
.Fn task_add ,
and
.Fn task_del
can be called during autoconf, from process context, or from interrupt context.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn taskq_create
returns a pointer to a taskq structure on success or
.Dv NULL
on failure.
.Pp
.Fn task_add
will return 1 if the task
.Fa t
was added to the taskq
.Fa tq
or 0 if the task was already queued.
.Pp
.Fn task_del
will return 1 if the task
.Fa t
was removed from the taskq
.Fa tq
or 0 if the task was not already on the queue.
