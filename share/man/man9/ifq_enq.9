.Sh DESCRIPTION
The ifqueue API provides implementions of data structures and
operations for the network stack to queue mbufs for a network driver
to dequeue from its start routine for transmission.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fn ifq_enq "struct ifqueue *ifq" "struct mbuf *m"
Enqueue mbuf
.Fa m
on the
.Fa ifq
interface send queue.
If the queue rejects the packet it will be freed with
.Xr m_freem 9
and counted as a drop.
.It Fn ifq_deq "struct ifqueue *ifq"
Dequeue the next mbuf to be transmitted from the
.Fa ifq
interface send queue.
.It Fn ifq_deq_begin "struct ifqueue *ifq"
Get a reference to the next mbuf to be transmitted from the
.Fa ifq
interface send queue.
If an mbuf is to be transmitted, also acquire a lock on the send queue
to exclude modification or freeing of the referenced mbuf.
The mbuf must not be freed, or have its length (m_pkthdr.len) or
cookie (m_pkthdr.ph_cookie) modified until it has been dequeued
completely with
.Fn ifq_deq_commit .
.It Fn ifq_deq_commit "struct ifqueue *ifq" "struct mbuf *m"
Dequeue the mbuf
.Fa m
that was referenced by a previous call to
.Fn ifq_deq_begin
and release the lock on
.Fa ifq .
.It Fn ifq_deq_rollback "struct ifqueue *ifq" "struct mbuf *m"
Release the lock on the interface send queue
.Fa ifq
that was acquired while a reference to
.Fa m
was being held.
.It Fn ifq_purge "struct ifqueue *ifq"
Free all the mbufs on the interface send queue
.Fa ifq .
Freed mbufs will be accounted as drops.
.It Fn ifq_len "struct ifqueue *ifq"
Return the number of mbufs on the interface send queue
.Fa ifq .
Note that while
.Fn ifq_len
may report that mbufs are on the queue, the current queue
discipline may not make them available for dequeueing with
.Fn ifq_deq
or
.Fn ifq_deq_begin .
.It Fn ifq_empty "struct ifqueue *ifq"
Return if the interface send queue
.Fa ifq
is empty.

.Sh CONTEXT
.Fn ifq_enq ,
.Fn ifq_deq ,
.Fn ifq_deq_begin ,
.Fn ifq_deq_commit ,
.Fn ifq_deq_rollback ,
.Fn ifq_purge ,
.Fn ifq_len ,
and
.Fn ifq_empty
can be called during autoconf, from process context, or from interrupt context.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn ifq_enq
returns 0 if the mbuf was successfully queued, or non-zero if mbuf was freed.
.Pp
.Fn ifq_deq
and
.Fn ifq_deq_begin
return the next mbuf to be transmitted by the interface.
If no packet is available for transmission,
.Dv NULL
is returned.
.Pp
.Fn ifq_purge
returns the number of mbufs that were removed from the queue and freed.
.Pp
.Fn ifq_len
returns the number of mbufs on the queue.
.Pp
.Fn ifq_empty
returns a non-zero value if the queue is empty, otherwise 0.
