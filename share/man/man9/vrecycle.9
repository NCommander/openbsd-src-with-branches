if its v_usecount field is zero.
If the usecount is not zero it simply returns.
If its usecount is zero and an interlock
.Fa inter_lkp
was passed, this will be unlocked before calling
.Xr vgonel 9 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn vrecycle
will return 1 if the vnode was placed on the free list.
It will return 0 if the usecount was not zero, and any lock passed in
.Fa inter_lkp
will still be locked.
