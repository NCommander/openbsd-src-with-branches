.Sh NAME
.Nm securelevel
.Nd securelevel and its effects
.Sh SYNOPSIS
The
.Ox
kernel provides four levels of system security:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It -1 Em "Permanently insecure mode" .
.Xr init 8
will not attempt to raise the securelevel. May be set via
.Xr sysctl 8
while the system is insecure, or by building a kernel with
.Dq option INSECURE
in the config file.
.It 0 Em "Insecure mode" .
Used during bootstrapping and while the system is single user.
System file flags may be cleared, and all devices may be read or
written subject to their permissions.
.It 1 Em "Secure mode" .
Default mode when system is multiuser:
.Bl -hyphen -compact
.It
securelevel may no longer be lowered except by init
.It
system immutable and append-only file flags may not be removed
.It
.Pa /dev/mem
and
.Pa /dev/kmem
may not be written to
.It
kernel modules may not be loaded or unloaded
.El
.It 2 Em "Highly secure mode" .
All effects of securelevel 1, plus:
.Bl -hyphen -compact
.It
disk devices are always read-only whether mounted or not
.It
.Xr settimeofday 2
may not set the time backwards
.It
.Xr ipf 8
and
.Xr ipnat 8
rulesets may not be changed
.El
.El
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Securelevel provides controlled means of
.Dq locking down
a system to a degree suited to its environment. It is normally set at
boot via the
.Xr rc.securelevel 8
script, or the superuser may raise securelevel at any time by modifying the
.Va kern.securelevel
.Xr sysctl 8
variable. However, only
.Xr init 8
may lower it once the system has entered secure mode.
.Pp
.Em Highly secure mode
may seem Draconian, but is intended as a last line of defence should the
superuser account be compromised. Its effects preclude circumvention of
file flags by direct modification of a raw disk device, or erasure of a
filesystem by means of
.Xr newfs 8 . 
Further, it can limit the potential damage of a compromised
.Dq firewall
by prohibiting the modification of packet filter rules. Preventing
the system clock from being set backwards aids in post-mortem analysis
and helps ensure the intergrity of logs. Precision timekeeping is not
affected because the clock may still be slowed.
