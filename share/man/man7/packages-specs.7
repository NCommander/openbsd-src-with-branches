.Dt PACKAGES-SPECS 7
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm packages-specs
.Nd binary package names specifications
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Each package has a name consisting of at most three parts:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
stem-version[-flavors]
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Ar stem
part identifies the package.
It may contain some dashes, but its form is mostly conventional.
For instance, japanese packages usually
start with a
.Sq ja
prefix, e.g.,
.Qq ja-kterm-6.2.0 .
.Pp
The
.Ar version
part starts at the first digit that follows a
.Sq - ,
and goes on up to the following
.Sq - ,
or to the end of the package name, if no flavor modifier is present.
It is highly recommended that all packages have a version number.
Normally, the version number directly matches the original software
distribution version number, or release date.
In case there are substantial changes in the
.Ox
package, a patch level marker should be appended, e.g.,
.Sq p1 ,
.Sq p2 ...
For example, assuming that the screen package for release 2.8 was
named
.Qq screen-2.9.8
and that an important security patch led to a newer package,
the new package would be called
.Qq screen-2.9.8p1 .
Obviously, these specific markers are reserved for
.Ox
purposes.
.Pp
Flavored packages will also contain a list of flavors after the version
identifier, in a canonical order determined by
.Ev FLAVORS
in the corresponding port's
.Pa Makefile .
For instance, kterm has an xaw3d flavor:
.Qq ja-kterm-xaw3d .
.Pp
Note that, to uniquely identify the version part, no flavor shall ever
start with a digit.
Usually, flavored packages are slightly different versions of the same
package that offer very similar functionalities.
.Sh CONFLICTS
Most conflicts between packages are handled on a package name basis.
Unless the packages have been specially prepared, it is
normally not possible to install two packages with the same
.Ar stem .
.Pp
Note that the
.Ar stem
ends at the
.Ar version
part.
So, for instance,
.Qq kdelibs-1.1.2
and
.Qq kdelibs-2.1.1
conflict.
But
.Qq openldap-2.0.7
and
.Qq openldap-client-2.0.7
don't.
Neither do
.Qq qt-1.45
and
.Qq qt2-3.0 .
.Sh DEPENDENCIES
Packages may depend on other packages, as specified by their port's
Makefile.
The
.Ar directory,[-multi],[flavor...]
part of the dependency is always used to obtain the default dependency for
the given package (the package that will be installed if no package
is found).
The corresponding package name is also used as a package specification,
unless a more specific specification has been given.
.Pp
Package specifications are extended package names, that may use
.Xr sh 1
-style wildcards, like
.Sq *
or
.Sq ? .
.Pp
A specification such as
.Qq ghostscript-*
may be used to ask for any version of package ghostscript,
or a more specific wildcard may be used, such as
.Qq png-1.0.* .
Version numbers may also include ranges, separated by commas, so for
instance,
.Qq foo-1.0.*,>=1.3,<1.5
would match either foo-1.0.something, or any version of foo between 1.3
and 1.5.
.Pp
If the flavor specification is left blank, any flavor will do.
Note that most default package names don't contain flavor specification,
which means that any flavor will do.
For instance, in
.Bd -literal -offset indent
LIB_DEPENDS=aa.1.2::graphics/aalib
.Ed
.Pp
both
.Qq aalib-1.2
and
.Qq aalib-1.2-no_x11
will do.
To restrict the specification to packages that match flavor
.Sq f ,
append
.Sq -f .
To restrict the specification to packages that do not match flavor
.Sq f ,
append
.Sq -!f .
In the preceding case, one may use
.Bd -literal -offset indent
LIB_DEPENDS=aa.1.2:aalib-1.2-!no_x11:graphics/aalib
.Ed
.Pp
to ensure the no_x11 flavor is not picked.
.Sh DEPENDENCIES RESOLUTION
Several packages may be specified for a dependency:
.Qq foo|bar
will match either package foo, or package bar.
In the general case, each package holds a tree of dependencies.
Resolution occurs at
.Xr pkg_add 1
time, and all dependencies are tracked only as far as needed.
.Pp
For instance, if package
.Qq foo
depends on either
.Qq bar
or
.Qq fuzz ,
and
.Qq bar
depends
on
.Qq toughluck ,
.Xr pkg_add 1
will first check whether
.Qq bar
or
.Qq fuzz
is installed.
If either is there, the
.Qq toughluck
dependency will never be examined.
It would only be used in the case where neither
.Qq bar
nor
.Qq fuzz
are present, thus
.Xr pkg_add 1
would decide to bring in
.Qq bar ,
and so would check on
.Qq toughluck .
.Sh HISTORY
Support for these package specifications first appeared in
.Ox 2.9 .
