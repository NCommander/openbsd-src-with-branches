.Dt LIBRARY-SPECS 7
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm library-specs
.Nd shared library name specifications
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Each
.Ev WANTLIB
item in the port tree conforms to
.Bd -literal -offset indent
libname[.=major[.minor]]
.Ed
.Pp
or
.Bd -literal -offset indent
libname[.>=major[.minor]]
.Ed
.Pp
All libraries that a package needs must be mentioned in that list.
Except for system and X11 libraries, they all must be reachable through
.Ev LIB_DEPENDS
and
.Ev RUN_DEPENDS ,
directly, or indirectly through recursive dependencies.
.Pp
Conversely, the ports tree
uses
.Ev WANTLIB
to check whether a given
.Ev LIB_DEPENDS
will be required at runtime for shared libraries, and thus turn it into a
.Cm @depend
line
.Po
see
.Xr pkg_create 1
.Pc .
.Pp
The package system will embed correct dependency checks in the built
package in the form of
.Cm @wantlib
lines, according to the normal shared library semantics: any library with
the same major number, and a greater or equal minor number will do.
.Pp
Note that static libraries can only satisfy a library specification if
no shared library has been found.
Thus, if WANTLIB=foo.>=5, and both libfoo.so.4.0 and libfoo.a are present,
the check will fail.
.Pp
Therefore, porters must strive to respect correct shared library semantics
in their own ports: by bumping the minor number each time the interface is
augmented, and by bumping the major number each time the interface changes.
Note that adding functions to a library is an interface augmentation.
Removing functions is an interface change.
.Pp
The major.minor components of the library specification are used only as a
build-time check, the run-time checks are computed by ports tree internals.
For
.Sq libname.>=major[.minor] ,
any library which is more recent than the given major.minor version will
do.
If a specific major number is needed, use the form
.Sq libname.=major[.minor] .
If the minor component is left empty, any minor will do.
If both components are left empty, any version will do.
.Pp
If a given architecture does not support shared libraries, all
.Ev LIB_DEPENDS
will be turned into simple
.Ev BUILD_DEPENDS
checks, and so,
failure to mention
.Ev RUN_DEPENDS
if the port needs anything beyond libraries from the dependent port will
lead to strange errors on such architectures.

.Sh HISTORY
Full support for library specifications first appeared in
.Ox 3.1 .
The format of specifications changed slightly to include
.Sq >=
before
.Ox 4.0 .
The interactions between
.Ev LIB_DEPENDS
and
.Ev WANTLIB
were modified and clarified for
.Ox 4.8 .
