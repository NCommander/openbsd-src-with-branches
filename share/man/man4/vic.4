.Sh NAME
.Nm vic
.Nd VMware VMXnet Virtual Interface Controller device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd vic* at pci?
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the VMXnet virtual NIC available in virtual
machines by VMware.
It appears as a simple Ethernet device but is actually a virtual network
interface to the underlying host operating system.
.Pp
This driver supports the
.Ic vmxnet
driver protocol, as an alternative to the emulated
.Xr pcn 4
and
.Xr em 4
interfaces also available in the VMware environment.
The
.Nm vic
driver is optimized for the virtual machine, it can provide advanced
capabilities depending on the underlying host operating system and
the physical network interface controller of the host.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width autoselect
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The driver always uses the fastest available speed and the media
options provided by the underlying host of the virtual machine.

.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports VMware Virtual NICs provided by the following
known products:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact -offset indent
.It
VMware ESX Server
.It
VMware GSX Server 2.5 and newer
.It
VMware Server

.Sh EXAMPLES
For VMware to add a virtual NIC to a virtual machine, the virtualDev parameter
on an Ethernet device must be specified as "vmxnet":
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ethernet0.present = "TRUE"
ethernet0.virtualDev = "vmxnet"
