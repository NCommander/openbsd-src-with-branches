.Pp
These controllers support RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, JBOD,
and superpositions of those configurations.
.Pp
Although the controllers are actual RAID controllers,
the driver makes them look just like SCSI controllers.
All RAID configuration is done through the controllers' BIOSes.
.Pp
Monitoring status for the volume and drives in it is done through the
.Xr bioctl 8
utility;
the current status is provided by the
.Xr sysctl 8
variable
.Va hw.sensors .
