.Nm iwn
.Nd "Intel WiFi Link 4965/5000/1000/6000 IEEE 802.11a/g/n wireless network devices"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "iwn* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for
.Tn Intel
Wireless WiFi Link 4965/5000/1000 and 6000 Series PCIe Mini Card network
adapters.
.Pp
The Intel Wireless WiFi Link 4965AGN (codenamed Kedron) is a PCIe
Mini Card network adapter that operates in the 2GHz and 5GHz spectra.
It has 2 transmit paths and 3 receiver paths (2T3R).
It is part of the fourth-generation Centrino platform (codenamed Santa Rosa).
.Pp
The Intel WiFi Link 5000 series is a family of wireless network adapters
that operate in the 2GHz and 5GHz spectra.
They are part of the fifth-generation Centrino platform (codenamed Montevina).
These adapters are available in both PCIe Mini Card (model code ending by MMW)
and PCIe Half Mini Card (model code ending by HMW) form factor.
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the 5100 (codenamed Shirley Peak 1x2),
5150 (codenamed Echo Peak-V), 5300 (codenamed Shirley Peak 3x3) and
5350 (codenamed Echo Peak-P) adapters.
The 5100 and 5150 adapters have 1 transmit path and 2 receiver paths (1T2R).
The 5300 and 5350 adapters have 3 transmit paths and 3 receiver paths (3T3R).
.Pp
The Intel WiFi Link 1000 (codenamed Condor Peak) is a single-chip wireless
network adapter that operates in the 2GHz spectrum.
It is part of the sixth-generation Centrino platform (codenamed Calpella).
It is available in both PCIe Mini Card (model code ending by MMW)
and PCIe Half Mini Card (model code ending by HMW) form factor.
It has 1 transmit path and 2 receiver paths (1T2R).
.Pp
The Intel Centrino Ultimate-N 6300 (codenamed Puma Peak 3x3) is a single-chip
wireless network adapter that operates in the 2GHz and 5GHz spectra.
It has 3 transmit paths and 3 receiver paths (3T3R).
The Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6250 (codenamed Kilmer Peak) is a combo
WiFi/WiMAX network adapter that operates in the 2GHz and 5GHz spectra.
It has 2 transmit paths and 2 receiver paths (2T2R).
The Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6200 (codenamed Puma Peak 2x2) is
a wireless network adapter that operates in the 2GHz and 5GHz spectra.
It has 2 transmit paths and 2 receiver paths (2T2R).
These adapters are part of the sixth-generation Centrino platform
(codenamed Calpella).
.Pp
These are the modes the
.Nm
driver can operate in:
.Bl -tag -width "IBSS-masterXX"
.It BSS mode
Also known as
.Em infrastructure
mode, this is used when associating with an access point, through
which all traffic passes.
This mode is the default.
.It monitor mode
In this mode the driver is able to receive packets without
associating with an access point.
This disables the internal receive filter and enables the card to
capture packets from networks which it wouldn't normally have access to,
or to scan for access points.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured to use
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) or
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK).
WPA is the de facto encryption standard for wireless networks.
It is strongly recommended that WEP
not be used as the sole mechanism
to secure wireless communication,
due to serious weaknesses in it.
The
.Nm
driver offloads both encryption and decryption of unicast data frames to the
hardware for the CCMP cipher.
.Pp
The device has one temperature sensor in degC.
Sensor data is updated every 500 milliseconds.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or on boot with
.Xr hostname.if 5 .
.Sh FILES
The driver needs at least version 5.3 of the following firmware files,
which are loaded when an interface is brought up:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Pa /etc/firmware/iwn-4965
.It Pa /etc/firmware/iwn-5000
.It Pa /etc/firmware/iwn-5150
.It Pa /etc/firmware/iwn-1000
.It Pa /etc/firmware/iwn-6000
.El
.Pp
These firmware files are not free because Intel refuses to grant
distribution rights without contractual obligations.
As a result, even though
.Ox
includes the driver, the firmware files cannot be included and
users have to download these files on their own.
.Pp
A prepackaged version of the firmware, designed to be used with
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
can be found at:
.Bd -literal -offset 3n
http://damien.bergamini.free.fr/packages/openbsd/iwn-firmware-5.3.tgz
.Ed
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following
.Xr hostname.if 5
example configures iwn0 to join whatever network is available on boot,
using WEP key
.Dq 0x1deadbeef1 ,
channel 11, obtaining an IP address using DHCP:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dhcp NONE NONE NONE nwkey 0x1deadbeef1 chan 11
.Ed
.Pp
Configure iwn0 to join network
.Dq my_net
using WPA-PSK with passphrase
.Dq my_passphrase :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig iwn0 nwid my_net wpa wpapsk \e
	`wpa-psk my_net my_passphrase`
.Ed
.Pp
Return iwn0 to its default settings:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig iwn0 -bssid -chan media autoselect \e
	nwid "" -nwkey -wpa -wpapsk
.Ed
.Pp
Join an existing BSS network,
.Dq my_net :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig iwn0 192.168.1.1 netmask 0xffffff00 nwid my_net
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "iwn%d: device timeout"
A frame dispatched to the hardware for transmission did not complete in time.
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.
.It "iwn%d: fatal firmware error"
For some reason, the firmware crashed.
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.
.It "iwn%d: radio is disabled by hardware switch"
The radio transmitter is off and thus no packet can go out.
The driver will reset the hardware.
Make sure the laptop radio switch is on.
.It "iwn%d: error %d, could not read firmware %s"
For some reason, the driver was unable to read the firmware image from the
filesystem.
The file might be missing or corrupted.
.It "iwn%d: firmware file too short: %d bytes"
The firmware image is corrupted and can't be loaded into the adapter.
.It "iwn%d: could not load firmware"
An attempt to load the firmware into the adapter failed.
The driver will reset the hardware.

.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Damien Bergamini Aq damien@openbsd.org .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
driver does not support any of the 802.11n capabilities offered by
the adapters.
Additional work is required in
.Xr ieee80211 9
before those features can be supported.
