DEC DC21x4x Ethernet device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "de* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Ethernet adapters based on the Digital
Equipment DC21x4x based self-contained Ethernet chips and clones of
those chips.
.Pp
It supports the DEC PCI DE435 card, DEC EISA DE425, DEC DE450, DEC DE500,
SMC 8432, 9332 and 9334, Cogent EM100FX and EM440TX, Asante, 
ZNYX ZX3xx, Lite-On PNIC, Netgear FA310TX dev D1, and others based on
the 21040 and 21041 Ethernet controllers,
the LC82C168 Ethernet controller,
or
the 21140[A], 21141, 21142 and 21143 Fast 100Mbps Ethernet controllers.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options
.It 10baseT
Set 10Mbps operation on the 10baseT port
.It 10base2
Set 10Mbps operation on the BNC port
.It 10base5
Set 10Mbps operation on the AUI port
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (fast ethernet) operation
.It 100baseFX
Set 100Mbps operation
.It 100baseT4
Set 100Mbps operation (4-pair cat-3 cable)
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It full-duplex
Set full duplex operation for UTP port
.El
.Pp
Note that the media types available depend on the particular card in use.
Some cards are explicitly programmed to a particular media type by a
setup utility and are not changeable.
.Pp
Use the
.Xr ifconfig 8
command an in particular the
.Fl m
flag to list the supported media types for your particular card.
.Pp
The old
.Dq ifconfig linkN
method of configuration is not supported.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "de%d: waking device from sleep/snooze mode"
The 21041 and 21140A chips support suspending the operation of the card.
.It "de%d: error: desired IRQ of %d does not match device's actual IRQ of %d"
The device probe detected that the board is configured for a different 
interrupt than the one specified in the kernel configuration file.
.It "de%d: not configured; limit of %d reached or exceeded"
There is a limit of 32
.Nm
devices allowed in a single machine.
.It "de%d: not configured; 21040 pass 2.0 required (%d.%d found)"
.It "de%d: not configured; 21140 pass 1.1 required (%d.%d found)"
Certain revisions of the chipset are not supported by this driver.
.El
.Sh CAVEATS
Since the 21040 is available on both EISA and PCI boards, one must be careful
in how defines the 21040 in the kernel config file.
