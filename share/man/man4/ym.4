.Sh DESCRIPTION

driver provides support for Yamaha OPL3-SAX chipset-based cards.
cards. 

.Sh BUGS
The "FM" DAC, wavetable synth, and MIDI port are not
supported.  I can't seem to access any of the extended registers so
master volume, mute, 3-d control might not work through the mixer interface.
Lots of work needed.

.Sh HISTORY
This driver is a thin wrapper around the
