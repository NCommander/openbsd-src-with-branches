.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm enc
.Nd Encapsulating Interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device enc 1"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface is a software loopback mechanism that allows hosts or
firewalls to filter
.Xr ipsec 4
traffic using
.Xr ipf 5 .
The
.Xr vpn 8
manpage shows an example of such a setup.
.Pp
The other use of the
.Nm
interface is to allow an administrator to see outgoing packets before
they have been processed by
.Xr ipsec 4 ,
or incoming packets after they have been similarly processed, via
.Xr tcpdump 1 .
.Pp
There is only one
.Nm
interface, named
.Dq enc0 ,
regardless of the argument given on the
.Sy pseudo-device
line in the kernel configuration file.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To see all outgoing packets before they have been processed via
.Xr ipsec 4 ,
or all incoming packets after they have been similarly processed:
.Bd -literal
#> ifconfig enc0 up
#> tcpdump -i enc0
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr tcpdump 1 ,
.Xr bpf 4 ,
.Xr inet 4 ,
.Xr ipsec 4 ,
.Xr netintro 4 ,
.Xr ipf 5 ,
.Xr vpn 8
.Sh BUGS
The
.Cm PROMISC
flag is not cleared on the enc0 interface after
.Xr tcpdump
is stopped.
