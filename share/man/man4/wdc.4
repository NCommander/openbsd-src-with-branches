.Sh NAME
.Nm wdc
.Nd WD100x compatible hard disk controller driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "wdc0 at isa? port 0x1f0 irq 14"
.Cd "wdc0 at isa? port 0x170 irq 15"
.Cd "wdc* at isapnp?"
.Cd "wdc* at pcmcia? function ?"
.Cd "wd* at wdc? drive ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides the basic functions for the
.Xr wd 4
and
.Xr atapi 4
drivers. It supports IDE and EIDE controllers, as well as MFM, RLL, and ESDI on
the ISA bus. PCI IDE controllers in legacy mode are also supported, but the
.Xr pciide 4
driver may provide more functionalities.
.Pp
For the ISA front-end, the 0x01 flag enables 32-bit I/O negotiation.
This is known to cause problems with some motherboards.
