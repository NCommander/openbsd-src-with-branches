.Sh NAME
.Nm ses
.Nd SCSI Environmental Services Driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ses* at scsibus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for all
.Tn SCSI
devices of the environmental services class that are attached to the system
through a supported
.Tn SCSI
Host Adapter, as well as emulated support for SAF-TE (SCSI Accessible
Fault Tolerant Enclosures).
The environmental services class generally are enclosure devices that
provide environmental information such as number of power supplies (and
state), temperature, device slots, and so on.
.Pp
A
.Tn SCSI
Host
adapter must also be separately configured into the system
before a
.Tn SCSI
Environmental Services device can be configured.
.Sh IOCTLS
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls apply to
.Em SES
devices.
They are defined in the header file
.Aq Pa scsi/ses.h .
.Bl -tag -width SESIOC_GETENCSTAT
.It Dv SESIOC_GETNOBJ
Used to find out how many
.Em SES
objects are driven by this particular device instance.
.It Dv SESIOC_GETOBJMAP
Read, from the kernel, an array of
.Em SES
objects which contains the object identifier, which subenclosure it is in,
and the
.Em SES
type of the object.
.It Dv SESIOC_GETENCSTAT
Get the overall enclosure status.
.It Dv SESIOC_SETENCSTAT
Set the overall enclosure status.
.It Dv SESIOC_GETOBJSTAT
Get the status of a particular object.
.It Dv SESIOC_SETOBJSTAT
Set the status of a particular object.
.It Dv SESIOC_GETTEXT
Get the associated help text for an object (not yet implemented).
.Em SES
devices often have descriptive text for an object which can provide
information such as location (e.g. "power supply left").
.It Dv SESIOC_INIT
Initialize the enclosure.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/sesNN -compact
.It /dev/ses Ns Ar N
The
.Ar N Ns Li th
.Em SES
device.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
When the kernel is configured with
.Tn DEBUG
enabled, the first open to an
.Em SES
device will spit out overall enclosure parameters to the console.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was written for the
.Tn SCSI
subsystem by Matthew Jacob.
This is the functional equivalent of a similar driver available in
Solaris, Release 7.
