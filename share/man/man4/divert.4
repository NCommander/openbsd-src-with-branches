.Sh NAME
.Nm divert
.Nd kernel packet diversion mechanism
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/socket.h>
.Fd #include <netinet/in.h>
.Ft int
.Fn socket AF_INET SOCK_RAW IPPROTO_DIVERT
.Ft int
.Fn socket AF_INET6 SOCK_RAW IPPROTO_DIVERT
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Divert sockets are part of a mechanism completely integrated with
.Xr pf 4
that queues raw packets from the kernel stack to userspace applications,
and vice versa.
.Pp
A divert socket must be bound to a divert port through
.Xr bind 2 ,
which only the superuser can do.
Divert ports have their own number space, completely separated from
.Xr tcp 4
and
.Xr udp 4 .
When
.Xr pf 4
processes a packet that matches a divert rule (see
.Xr pf.conf 5
for details) it is immediately sent to the divert socket listening on the
port specified in the rule.
.Xr pf 4
reassembles TCP streams by default (if IP reassembly is not disabled)
before sending them to the divert sockets.
If there are no divert sockets listening, the packets are dropped.
.Pp
Packets can be read via
.Xr read 2 ,
.Xr recv 2 ,
or
.Xr recvfrom 2
from the divert socket.
The application that is processing the packets can then reinject them into the
kernel.
After being reinjected, inbound and outbound packets are treated differently.
Inbound packets are added to the relevant input queue and a soft interrupt is
scheduled to signal that a new packet is ready to be processed; outbound ones
are processed directly by the relevant IP/IPv6 output function.
The packets' checksums are recalculated upon reinjection.
.Pp
Writing to a divert socket can be achieved using
.Xr sendto 2
and it will skip
.Xr pf 4
filters to avoid loops.
A diverted packet that is not reinjected into the kernel stack is lost.
.Pp
Receive and send divert socket buffer space can be tuned through
.Xr sysctl 8 .
.Xr netstat 1
shows information relevant to divert sockets.

protocol first appeared in
