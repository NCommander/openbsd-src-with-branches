.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm divert
.Nd kernel packet diversion mechanism
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/socket.h>
.Fd #include <netinet/in.h>
.Ft int
.Fn socket AF_INET SOCK_RAW IPPROTO_DIVERT
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Divert sockets can be bound through
.Xr bind 2
to a divert port and they will receive every packet
diverted to that port by
.Xr pf 4 .
Divert ports have their own number space, completely
separated from
.Xr tcp 4
and
.Xr udp 4
ones.
Consult
.Xr pf.conf 5
for the correct syntax.
Packets can also be reinjected into the divert socket, in which case they
re-enter kernel packet processing skipping
.Xr pf 4
filters, avoiding loops.
.Pp
Diverted packets can be read via
.Xr read 2 ,
.Xr recv 2 ,
or
.Xr recvfrom 2
from the divert socket.
.Xr pf 4
will reassemble the IP packets by default before sending them to the divert
socket.
In addition, TCP reassembling is enabled for packet divert rules; see
.Xr pf.conf 5
for details.
Writing to a divert socket can be achieved using
.Xr sendto 2
and it will skip
.Xr pf 4
filters to avoid loops.
.Pp
If
.Xr pf 4
diverts packets but there are no divert sockets listening,
the packets are dropped.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr socket 2 ,
.Xr ip 4 ,
.Xr pf.conf 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
protocol first appeared in
.Ox 4.7.
