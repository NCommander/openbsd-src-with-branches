.Sh NAME
.Nm auich
.Nd ICH-based PCI audio device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "auich* at pci? flags 0x0000"
.Cd "audio* at auich?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the AC'97-based audio present on the Intel
82801AA/AB/BA/CA/DB/EB/FB/GB I/O controller hub
(ICH, ICH0, ICH2, ICH3, ICH4, ICH5, ICH6, ICH7),
82440MX chipset, SiS 7012, AMD 768, AMD 8111, NVIDIA nForce, nForce2,
nForce3 and nForce4 chips.
The
.Nm
DMA engine supports full-duplex operation and has separate channels
for line input and microphone.
Unfortunately, simultaneous recording from both line and microphone inputs
is not supported due to the current
.Xr ac97 4
design.
Setting
.Ar flags
to 0x0001 will compensate for machines that have reversed stereo.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ac97 4 ,
.Xr audio 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 2.8 .
.Sh CAVEATS
Some hardware implementations only support 48kHz sampling rates.
