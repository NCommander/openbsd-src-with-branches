.Sh NAME
.Nm aria
.Nd
Aria 16 device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "aria0 at isa? port 0xPPP irq X drq Y flags Z"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for sound cards based on Sierra Semiconductor's
Aria chipset.  Cards based on this chipset are capable of recording and
playing 8- or 16-bit samples in mono or stereo up to 44.1KHz.  Some chipsets
only play linear or ADCPM, but others will also play Mu-law and A-law
sounds.  Three different mixer configurations are available.
.Pp
The I/O Port Base is selected from 0x280, 0x290, 0x2a0 and 0x2b0. The
selection method depends on the board. The Aria takes 8 ports.
.Pp
The IRQ is selected from 10, 11, or 12.
.Pp
The DRQ line is chosen from 5 or 6, this driver will work with or without
a DRQ.  If no DRQ is given, then the
.Nm aria
driver will simply use Direct I/O.
.Pp
The flags currently supported are 0x1, for the Prometheus Aria 16/Aria 16se.
This flag tells the driver to initialise the card.  It is a weird undocumented
piece of horribleness, but the card will not respond until you twiddle with
the joystick port...
.Sh BUGS
The driver has only been tested on a Prometheus Aria 16.
.Pp
No DMA support, yet, so don't bother setting a DRQ.
.Pp
The full-duplex features are horribly inconsistent (i.e., unusable).
.Pp
The card sometimes drops out, and needs to be reset.  This can be
accomplished by opening and closing
.Pa /dev/audio ,
e.g.,
.Dq echo -n >/dev/audio
.Pp
The joystick and MIDI port interfaces are not supported.
