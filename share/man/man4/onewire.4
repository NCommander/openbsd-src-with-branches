.Sh DESCRIPTION
1-Wire bus was originally developed by Dallas Semiconductor for connecting
integrated circuits.
It is commonly used for connecting devices such as electronic keys, EEPROMs,
temperature sensors, real-time clocks, security chips, etc.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides a uniform programming interface layer between
1-Wire master controllers and various 1-Wire slave devices.
Each 1-Wire master controller attaches a
.Nm
framework; several slave devices can then be attached to the
.Nm
bus.
.Pp
The driver supports plugging and unplugging slave devices on the fly.
