Lan Media Corporation SSI/DS1/HSSI/DS3 card device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "lmc* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "pseudo-device sppp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Lan Media Corporation SSI, DS1, HSSI, and DS3
PCI WAN adapters based on the DEC 21140 ethernet chip.  The adapters use
a DEC 21140 ethernet chip for the PCI bus interface.  Leaving the bus
interface chip, the data path goes through a field programmable gate array,
where HDLC processing is accomplished.  Leaving the FPGA, there are FIFO
buffers and the DS1, DS3, and V.35 drive circuitry.
.Pp
The intent is to provide a synchronous serial link with HDLC framing at speeds
of up to 10Mbps (for the SSI card), 52Mbps (for the HSSI card), BNC connectors
for 45Mbps operation without a CSU/DSU (DS3 card), and an RJ45 jack for
T1/E1 operation without a CSU/DSU (DS1 card).
.Pp
The card will automatically use HDLC framing and defaults to external clock
source.  For the DS1 and DS3 cards with built in CSU/DSU functionality,
the clock source is always external (from CSU/DSU).  The ability to set cable
length is not currently implemented.
.Pp
Using the sppp driver, you can also use the ppp protocol.  In either
case, the lmc interface should be configured as a point-to-point link.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "lmc%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "lmc%d: couldn't establish interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "lmc%d: enabling keepalive"
Cisco HDLC keepalive packets will be transmitted
.It "lmc%d: disabling keepalive"
Cisco HDLC keepalive packets will not be transmitted
.It "lmc%d: clock internal"
The card is using internal clocking for the line
.It "lmc%d: clock external"
The card is using external clocking for the line
.It "lmc%d: asserting DTR and RTS"
The card is sending DTR and RTS signals on the line
.It "lmc%d: deasserting DTR and RTS"
The card is not sending DTR and RTS signals on the line
.It "lmc%d: Abormal interrupt"
The card received an incomplete request.  This may be a sign of a hardware
fault.
.It "lmc%d: tx_intr: failed to dequeue mbuf?!?"
Only available if compiled with LMC_DEBUG
.It "lmc%d: txput: tx not running"
Problem from tulip,
Only available if compiled with LMC_DEBUG

Lan Media Corporation has a web site with data, descriptions, and pictures
of their cards at www.lanmedia.com.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver was first released from LMC to support their cards,
and was later included in NetBSD 1.4.
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
device driver was written by Michael Graff, and was derived in part from
Matt Thomas'
.Xr de 4
driver.  The OpenBSD port and manual page are from Chris Cappuccio.  Later
enhancements to support the LMC1200 card are based on LMC's Linux driver.
