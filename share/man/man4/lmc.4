Lan Media Corporation SSI/HSSI/DS3 card device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "lmc* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Lan Media Corporation SSI, HSSI, and DS3 PCI
WAN adapters based on the DEC 21140 ethernet chip (with supporting
chips to handle the HDLC framing, and synchronous serial interface.)  The intent
is to provide a synchronous serial link with HDLC framing at speeds
of up to 10Mbps (for the SSI card), 52Mbps (for the HSSI card) and DSX jacks
for 45Mbps operation without a CSU/DSU (DS3 card).
.Pp
The card will automatically use HDLC framing and defaults to external clock source.  It should be configured as any point-to-point link.
