.Sh NAME
.Nm wi
.Nd WaveLAN/IEEE and PRISM-II 802.11DS wireless network driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "wi* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "wi* at pcmcia? function ?"
.Cd "wi* at macobio?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for wireless network adapters based around
the Lucent Hermes, Intersil PRISM-II, Intersil PRISM-2.5, and Symbol
Spectrum24 chipsets.
All four chipsets provide a similar interface to the driver.
.Pp
All host/device interaction is via programmed I/O.
Supported features include 802.11 and 802.3 frames, power management, BSS,
IBSS, WDS and ad-hoc operation modes.
Cards based on the Intersil PRISM-II and PRISM-2.5 chips also support a
host-based access point mode which allows a card to act as a normal access
point (with some assistance from the
.Nm
driver).
The Lucent Hermes and Symbol Spectrum24 chipsets do not contain this
functionality.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver encapsulates all IP and ARP traffic as 802.11 frames, however
it can receive either 802.11 or 802.3 frames.
Transmit speed is selectable between 1Mbps fixed, 2Mbps fixed, 2Mbps
with auto fallback, 5.5Mbps, 8Mbps, or 11Mbps depending on your hardware.
The Lucent WaveLAN/IEEE Silver and Gold cards as well as the Intersil
and Symbol cards have support for WEP encryption.
The WaveLAN Gold as well as newer Intersil and Symbol cards support
104bit keys, the others only accept 40bit keys.
The Lucent WaveLAN/IEEE Bronze cards do not support WEP at all.
To enable encryption, use the
.Xr wicontrol 8
utility to set your keys, or use
.Xr ifconfig 8
as shown below.
.Pp
By default, the
.Nm
driver configures the card for BSS operation (aka infrastructure
mode).
This mode requires the use of an access point (base station).
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver also supports an ad-hoc (point-to-point) mode where
the nwid is ignored and stations can communicate amongst
themselves without the aid of an access point.
Note that there are two possible ad-hoc modes.
One mode, referred to as
.Dq ad-hoc demo mode ,
predates the IEEE 802.11 specification and so may not interoperate
with cards from other vendors.
The standardized ad-hoc mode, also known as IBSS mode, is not
supported by cards with very old firmware revisions.
.Pp
Cards based on the Intersil PRISM-II and PRISM-2.5 chips also
have a host-based access point mode which allows the card to
act as an access point (base station).
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
Cards supported by the
.Nm
driver come in a variety of packages, though the most common
are of the PCMCIA type.
In many cases, the PCI version of a wireless card is simply
a PCMCIA card bundled with a PCI adapter.
The PCI adapters come in two flavors: true PCMCIA bridges and
dumb PCMCIA bridges.
A true PCMCIA bridge (such as those sold by Lucent) will attach
as a real PCMCIA controller.
The wireless card will then attach to the PCMCIA bus.
Wireless cards in PCMCIA slots may be inserted and ejected on the fly.
.br
A dumb bridge, on the other hand, does not show up as a true PCMCIA bus.
The wireless card will simply appear to the host as a normal PCI
device and will not require any PCMCIA support.
Cards in this type of adapter should only be removed when the
machine is powered down.
.Pp
The following cards are among those supported to by
.Nm
driver:

Note that some of the PRISM-II adapters only work at 3.3V, hence
.Xr cardbus 4
support is required for those cards to set VCC correctly, even
though they are really 16bit cards.
.Pp
Several vendors sell PCI adapters built around the PLX Technology 9050
or 9052 chip.
The following such adapters are supported or expected to work:

device driver first appeared in
.Fx 3.0 .
.Ox
support was added in
.Ox 2.6 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by Bill Paul <wpaul@ctr.columbia.edu> and ported to

.Sh CAVEATS
The original Lucent WaveLAN cards usually default to channel 3;
newer cards use channel 10 by default.
Non-Lucent cards vary, for instance the Addtron cards use channel
11 by default.
See
.Xr wicontrol 8
for information on how to change the channel.
