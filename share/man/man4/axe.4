.Nd ASIX Electronics AX88172 USB Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "axe*   at uhub?"
.Cd "rlphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the ASIX
Electronics AX88172 USB 2.0 chipset, including the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It ATEN UC-210T
.It Billionton Systems USB2AR
.It Buffalo(MELCO) LUA-U2-KTX
.It Corega FEther USB2-TX
.It D-Link DUB-E100
.It Hawking UF200
.It Intellinet USB 2.0 to Ethernet (rev A)
.It JVC MP-PRX1
.It LinkSys USB200M
.It Netgear FA120
.It Sitecom LN-029
.It SnapPort USB 2.0 LAN Adapter
.It ST Lab USB 2.0 Fast Ethernet
.It Surecom EP-1427X-2
.It System TALKS SGC-X2UL
.It TRENDnet TU2-ET100
.El
.Pp
The AX88172 is a USB 2.0 device which contains a 10/100
Ethernet MAC with MII interface and is designed to work with both
Ethernet and HomePNA transceivers.
The AX88172 will operate with
both USB 1.x and USB 2.0 controllers, however performance with 1.x
controllers will be limited since the USB 1.x standard specifies a
maximum transfer speed of 12Mbps.
Users with USB 1.x controllers should therefore not expect to actually
achieve 100Mbps speeds with these devices.
.Pp
The AX88172 supports a 64-bit multicast hash table,
single perfect filter entry for the station address,
all-multicast mode, and promiscuous mode.
Packets are
received and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer endpoints.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width "autoselect"
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options (this is the default).
The user can manually override the autoselected mode by adding media
options to the appropriate
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.It 10baseT
Set 10Mbps operation.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
.El
.Pp
The
.Tm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width "full-duplex"
.It full-duplex
Force full-duplex operation.
.It half-duplex
Force half-duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
The interface will operate in
half-duplex mode if no media option is specified.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "axe%d: watchdog timeout"
A packet was queued for transmission and a transmit command was
issued, however the device failed to acknowledge the transmission
before a timeout expired.
.It "axe%d: no memory for rx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the receiver ring.
