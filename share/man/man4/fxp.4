.Sh NAME
.Nm fxp
.Nd Intel EtherExpress PRO/100 Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "fxp* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "fxp* at cardbus? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports the Intel EtherExpress 100 family of Ethernet cards
based on the i82557, i82558, and i82559 chipsets. These come in several
different varieties, including dual-port cards, and as built-in Ethernet
solutions on certain motherboards. This includes, among others, the following
models:
.Pp
.Bl -item -offset indent -compact
.It
Intel EtherExpress PRO/100 PCI
.It
Intel EtherExpress PRO/100B PCI
.It
Intel EtherExpress PRO/100+ PCI
.It
Intel EtherExpress PRO/100 Dual-Port PCI
.It
Intel PRO/100 CardBus II PC Card
.El
.Pp
Other models of Intel network cards are supported by the
.Xr ie 4
and
.Xr iy 4
drivers.
This list is not exhaustive. In particular, the
.Nm
driver should support any card by any manufacturer which is based on one of the
aforementioned chipsets.
.Pp
The following media types and options (as given to
.Xr ifconfig 8 )
are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxx -offset indent
.It Cm media No autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options (default).
.It Cm media No 100baseTX Cm mediaopt No full-duplex
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation and force full-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 100baseTX Cm mediaopt No half-duplex
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation and force half-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 10baseT Cm mediaopt No full-duplex
Set 10Mbps operation and force full-duplex.
.It Cm media No 10baseT Cm mediaopt No half-duplex
Set 10Mbps operation and force half-duplex.
.El
.Pp
If no media options are present, the
.Nm
driver places the card into autoselect mode.
.Pp
These cards also come with a variety of PHYs. Models exist with PHYs supported
by both the
.Xr inphy 4
and
.Xr nsphy 4
drivers.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "fxp%d: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "fxp%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "fxp%d: Failed to malloc memory"
There are not enough mbuf's available for allocation.
.It "fxp%d: device timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
