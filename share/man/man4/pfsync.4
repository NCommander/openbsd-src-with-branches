.Sh NAME
.Nm pfsync
.Nd packet filter states table logging interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Sy pseudo-device Nm pfsync
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface is the interface to the packet filter,
.Xr pf 4 ,
exposing all the changes to the state table.
This allows for both debugging of rulesets and monitoring
for changes in the table by invoking
.Xr tcpdump 8
on the
.Nm
interface.
States created by a rule marked with the
.Ar no-sync
keyword are omitted from the
.Nm
interface (see
.Xr pf.conf 5
for details).
.Pp
Each packet retrieved on this interface has a header associated
with it of length
.Dv PFSYNC_HDRLEN .
The header indicates the version of the protocol, address family,
action taken on the following states and the number of state
table entries attached in this packet.
This structure, defined in
.Aq Pa net/if_pfsync.h
looks like:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct pfsync_header {
	u_int8_t version;
	u_int8_t af;
	u_int8_t action;
	u_int8_t count;
};
.Ed
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig pfsync0 up
# tcpdump -s1500 -evtni pfsync0

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device first appeared in
.Ox 3.3 .
