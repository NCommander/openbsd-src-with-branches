.Dt SIS 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sis
.Nd "SiS 190 10/100(/1000) Ethernet device"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sis* at pci?"
.Cd "rlphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
.An driver provides support for the Fast Ethernet controler SiS190
integrated into the SiS965L and SiS966L southbridges. The SiS191
gigabit controler in the SiS965 and SiS966 southbridges is not yet
supported. If you own such hardware and want to help please contact
.Aq madroach@zakweb.de
or the
.Aq tech@openbsd.org
mailing list.
.Pp
The SiS 190/191 are 100Mbps Ethernet MACs with external PHY. It uses a bus
master DMA and a scatter/gather descriptor scheme and includes a 64-bit
multicast hash filter.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.It 10baseT
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.

.It "seN: can't alloc rx/tx list buffers"
The driver failed to create DMA map for the receiver/transmitter ring.
.It "seN: can't load rx/tx ring mapping"
The driver failed to load the DMA mapping for the receiver/transmitter ring.
.It "seN: unable to allocate MBUF"
.It "seN: initialization failed: no memory for rx buffers"
The driver failed allocate memory for a receive or transmit buffer.
.It "seN: unable to load MBUF"
The driver failed to load the DMA mapping for a receive or transmit buffer.
.It "seN: watchdog timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
