.Sh NAME
.Nm pci
.Nd introduction to PCI bus support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pp
.Cd "pci* at mainbus? bus ?"
.Cd "pci* at pchb? bus ?"
.Cd "pci* at ppb? bus ?"
.Pp
Other
.Nm
attachments are machine-dependent and depend on the bus topology and
.Tn PCI
bus interface of your system.
See
.Xr intro 4
for your system for details.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The system includes a machine-independent
.Tn PCI
bus subsystem and
several machine-independent
.Tn PCI
device drivers.
.Pp
Your system may support additional
.Tn PCI
devices.
Drivers for
.Tn PCI
devices not listed here are machine-dependent.
Consult your system's
.Xr intro 4
for additional information.
.Pp
Note that interrupt mappings on the i386 may require that you configure
your BIOS to reserve sufficient interrupts as "PCI/ISAPnP" so that there
are sufficient interrupts remaining to configure the discovered PCI
devices.
.Sh SUPPORTED DEVICES
