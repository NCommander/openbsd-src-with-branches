.Sh NAME
.Nm pci
.Nd introduction to PCI bus support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pci* at mainbus? bus ?"
.Cd "pci* at pchb? bus ?"
.Cd "pci* at ppb? bus ?"
.Pp
Other
.Nm
attachments are machine-dependent and depend on the bus topology and
.Tn PCI
bus interface of your system.
See
.Xr intro 4
for your system for details.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The system includes a machine-independent
.Tn PCI
bus subsystem and
several machine-independent
.Tn PCI
device drivers.
.Pp
Your system may support additional
.Tn PCI
devices.
Drivers for
.Tn PCI
devices not listed here are machine-dependent.
Consult your system's
.Xr intro 4
for additional information.
.Ss Details specific to the i386
Note that interrupt mappings on the i386 may require that you configure
your BIOS to reserve sufficient interrupts as "PCI/ISAPnP" so that there
are sufficient interrupts remaining to configure the discovered PCI
devices.
For more information, see
.Xr pcibios 4 .

.Sh IOCTLS
If the kernel is compiled with the
.Cd option USER_PCICONF
kernel option, the following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls are supported by the
.Nm
driver.
They are defined in the header file
.Aq Pa sys/pciio.h .
.Bl -tag -width 012345678901234
.Pp
.It PCIOCREAD
This
.Xr ioctl 2
reads the
.Tn PCI
configuration registers specified by the passed-in
.Va pci_io
structure.
The
.Va pci_io
structure consists of the following fields:
.Bl -tag -width pi_width
.It pi_sel
A
.Va pcisel
structure which specifies the bus, slot and function the user would like to
query.
.It pi_reg
The
.Tn PCI
configuration register the user would like to access.
.It pi_width
The width, in bytes, of the data the user would like to read.
This value may be either 1, 2, or 4.  3-byte reads and reads larger than
4 bytes are not supported.
.It pi_data
The data returned by the kernel.
.El
.It PCIOCWRITE
This
.Xr ioctl 2
allows users to write to the
.Tn PCI
specified in the passed-in
.Va pci_io
structure.
The
.Va pci_io
structure is described above.
The limitations on data width described for
reading registers, above, also apply to writing
.Tn PCI
configuration registers.

.Sh HISTORY
The machine-independent
.Tn PCI
subsystem appeared in
.Ox 2.0 .
Support for device listing and matching was re-implemented by
Kenneth Merry, and first appeared in
.Fx 3.0 .
