.Nd USB keyboard support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ukbd*  at uhidev? reportid ?"
.Cd "wskbd* at ukbd? console ?"

with reports in usage page 7).

.Xr wscons 4
driver.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr uhidev 4 ,
.Xr usb 4 ,
.Xr wskbd 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver
appeared in
.Nx 1.4 .
.Ox
support was added in
.Ox 2.8 .

The
.Nm
driver is brought into action rather late in the boot process, so if
it is used as the console driver then
.Xr ddb 4
is not usable until late in the boot.
