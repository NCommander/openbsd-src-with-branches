.Sh NAME
.Nm inet6
.Nd Internet protocol version 6 family
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In netinet/in.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
family is an updated version of the
.Xr inet 4
family.
While
.Xr inet 4
implements Internet Protocol version 4,
.Nm
implements Internet Protocol version 6.
.Pp
The
.Nm
family is comprised of the
Internet Protocol version 6
.Pq IPv6
network protocol, Internet Control
Message Protocol version 6
.Pq ICMPv6 ,
Transmission Control Protocol
.Pq TCP ,
and User Datagram Protocol
.Pq UDP .
TCP is used to support the
.Dv SOCK_STREAM
abstraction while UDP is used to support the
.Dv SOCK_DGRAM
abstraction.
Note that TCP and UDP are common to
.Xr inet 4
and
.Nm inet6 .
A raw interface to IPv6 is available by creating an Internet socket of type
.Dv SOCK_RAW .
The ICMPv6 message protocol is accessible from a raw socket.
.Pp
For security reasons,
.Ox
does not route IPv4 traffic to an
.Dv AF_INET6
socket,
and does not support IPv4 mapped addresses,
where IPv4 traffic is seen as if it comes from an IPv6 address like
.Li ::ffff:10.1.1.1 .
Where both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic need to be accepted, listen on two sockets.
.Pp
It is also advisable to explicitly reject all packets to your network
not used by any of your interface prefixes.
Otherwise packets that have a destination address belonging to your network
may be routed back to your provider via the default route.
Set a reject route for your assigned prefix:
.Pp
.Dl # route add -net 2001:db8::/48 ::1 -reject
.Pp
IPv6 addresses are 128-bit quantities,
stored in network standard byteorder.
The include file
.In netinet/in.h
defines this address
as a discriminated union.
.Pp
Sockets bound to the
.Nm
family utilize the following addressing structure:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct sockaddr_in6 {
	u_int8_t	sin6_len;
	sa_family_t	sin6_family;
	in_port_t	sin6_port;
	u_int32_t	sin6_flowinfo;
	struct in6_addr	sin6_addr;
	u_int32_t	sin6_scope_id;
};
.Ed
.Pp
Sockets may be created with the local address
.Dq ::
.Po
which is equal to IPv6 address
.Dv 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0
.Pc
to effect
.Dq wildcard
matching on incoming messages.
.Pp
Global addresses utilise the first 48 bits of the address
for the routing prefix.
The next 16 bits designate the subnet,
and the final 64 bits are used as a host identifier.
.Pp
The IPv6 specification also defines link-local addresses,
which are scoped.
A scoped address is ambiguous to the kernel
if it is specified without a scope identifier.
To manipulate scoped addresses properly from userland,
programs must use the advanced API defined in RFC 3542.
A compact description of the advanced API is available in
.Xr ip6 4 .
If scoped addresses are specified without explicit scope,
the kernel may raise an error.
.Pp
KAME supports an extended numeric IPv6 address notation
for link-local addresses,
such as
.Dq fe80::1%de0
to specify
.Dq fe80::1
on the
.Dq de0
interface.
This notation is supported by
.Xr getaddrinfo 3
and
.Xr getnameinfo 3 ,
as well as userland programs such as
.Xr telnet 1
and
.Xr ftp 1 .
.Pp
Scoped addresses are handled specially in the kernel.
In kernel structures like routing tables or interface structures,
scoped addresses have their interface index embedded into the address.
Therefore
the address on some kernel structures is not the same as that on the wire.
The embedded index will be visible on
.Dv PF_ROUTE
sockets, kernel memory access via
.Xr kvm 3 ,
and some other occasions.
HOWEVER, users should never use the embedded form.
