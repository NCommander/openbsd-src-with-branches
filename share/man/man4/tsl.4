.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the TAOS TSL2560/61 light-to-digital
converters that transform light intensity into a digital signal
output.
These sensors contain a broadband photodiode and a infrared-responding
photodiode allowing tye derivation of the ambient light level as
experienced by the human eye.
This illuminace (in lux) is made available through the
.Xr sysctl 8
interface.
