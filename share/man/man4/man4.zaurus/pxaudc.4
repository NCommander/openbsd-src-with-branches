.Sh NAME
.Nm pxaudc
.Nd PXA27x USB Device Controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pxaudc0 at pxaip?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The PXA27x USB Device Controller is a programmable USB client device.
It is also responsible for dynamically switching the physical ports between
the USB host controller and itself by detecting whether a host or client
cable is plugged into the connector.
.Pp
An appropriate driver can configure the device controller to operate as a
variety of devices, e.g. an Ethernet or mass storage device, when plugged
into a USB host.
.Pp
Currently, the
.Nm
driver disables the functionality of the USB Device Controller and configures
the physical port to be always routed to the
.Xr ohci 4
controller.
In this mode the hardware only supports attachement of USB devices,
it will not operate as a USB device itself.

it is planned for the future.
