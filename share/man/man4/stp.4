.Sh NAME
.Nm stp
.Nd sbus pcmcia bridge
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "stp* at sbus? slot ? offset ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a
.Xr pcmcia 4
bridge for
.Xr sbus 4 .
It uses the STP4020 chipset and it is SUN part number 501-2367.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pcmcia 4 ,
.Xr sbus 4
.Sh BUGS
The driver provides a big-endian pcmcia bus, which is wrong in the
.Ox
context. Due to missing/incomplete documentation of the chipset it is not
known for sure if the hardware has any byteswapping mode. For sparc64 systems
this can easily be worked around in software, so this will be fixed. For
sparc systems, the fix might impose a serious performance degration and is
subject of further research.
