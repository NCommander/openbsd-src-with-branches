.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides access to the VMEbus.
On MVME141 boards, it operates the VMEbus part of the
.Xr ofobio 4
device.
On MVME147 boards, it operates the VMEchip ASIC connected to the
.\" .Xr pcc 4
PCCchip local bus controller.
On MVME165 boards, it operates the VMEbus part of the
.Xr lrc 4
local resource controller.
On MVME162 and MVME172 boards, it operates the VMEchip2 ASIC connectod to the
.\" .Xr mc 4
MCchip local bus controller.
On MVME166, MVME167, MVME176 and MVME177 boards, it operates the VMEchip2 ASIC
connected to the
.Xr pcctwo 4
PCCchip2 local bus controller.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver exposes the D16 and D32 access spaces through the
.Nm vmes
and
.Nm vmel
drivers, respectively.
.Pp
The currently supported VMEbus drivers are:
