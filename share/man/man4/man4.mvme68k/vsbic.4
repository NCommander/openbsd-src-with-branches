.Sh NAME
.Nm vsbic
.Nd MVME327A SCSI and floppy controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "vsbic* at vmes0 addr 0xffffa600 ipl 2 vec 0x8c"
.Cd "vsbic* at vmes0 addr 0xffffa700 ipl 2 vec 0x8d"
.Cd "scsibus* at vsbic?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the SCSI interface of the Motorola MVME327A
SCSI and floppy VME controller.
The WD33C93 SCSI controller found on this board is not directly accessible;
instead, the
.Nm
driver runs SCSI commands through the MVME327A firmware interface.
.Sh HARDWARE CONFIGURATION
The card's base address
.Po
matching the
.Em addr
locator on the configuration line
.Pc
is defined through a block of eight jumpers, labeled
.Dq J5
on the board, near its center.
.Pp
With the card oriented with its faceplate at the bottom and the VME connectors
at the top, the supported configurations are:
.Bl -column "xxxxxxxx" "0xffffffff" -offset indent
.It Li J5 Ta Address Ta Configuration
.It Li "_X_XX__X" Ta "0xffffa600" Ta "1st board"
.It Li "_X_XX___" Ta "0xffffa700" Ta "2nd board"

.Sh BUGS
Due to firmware limitations, SCSI commands using command blocks larger than
12 bytes are not supported.
Therefore, only the first 2TB of SCSI disks are accessible.
