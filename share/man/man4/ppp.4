.Sh NAME
.Nm ppp
.Nd point to point protocol network interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device ppp" Op Ar count
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface allows serial lines to be used as network interfaces using the
.Em Point-to-Point Protocol
(PPP).
.Pp
A
.Nm
interface can be created at runtime using the
.Ic ifconfig pppN create
command or by setting up a
.Xr hostname.if 5
configuration file for
.Xr netstart 8 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
interface can use various types of compression and has many features
over the SLIP protocol used by the
.Xr sl 4
interface.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It ppp%d: af%d not supported
