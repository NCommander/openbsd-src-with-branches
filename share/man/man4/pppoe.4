.Sh NAME
.Nm pppoe
.Nd PPP over Ethernet protocol network interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pseudo-device pppoe
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface encapsulates
.Em Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
packets inside Ethernet frames as defined by RFC 2516.
.Pp
This is often used to connect a router via a DSL modem to
an access concentrator.
The
.Nm
interface does not by itself transmit or receive frames,
but needs an Ethernet interface to do so.
This Ethernet interface is connected to the
.Nm
interface via
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
The Ethernet interface needs to be marked UP, but does not need to have an
IP address.
.Pp
There are two basic modes of operation, controlled via the
.Em link1
switch.
The default mode,
.Em link1
not being set, tries to keep the configured session open all the
time.
If the session is disconnected, a new connection attempt is started
immediately.
The
.Dq dial on demand
mode, selected by setting
.Em link1 ,
only establishes a connection when data is being sent to the interface.
.Pp
If the kernel is compiled with option
.Dv PPPOE_SERVER ,
there are two modes of connection, controlled via the
.Em link0
switch.
The default mode,
.Em link0
not being set, is client mode.
The
.Dq PPPoE server
mode, selected by setting
.Em link0 ,
is to wait for incoming PPPoE session.
.Pp
Before a
.Nm
interface is usable, it needs to be configured.
The following steps are necessary:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Create the interface.
.It
Connect an Ethernet interface.
This interface is used for the physical communication.
As noted above it must be marked UP, but need not have an IP address.
.It
Configure authentication.
The PPP session needs to identify the client to the peer.
For more details on the available options see
.Xr spppcontrol 8 .
.El
.Pp
This all is typically accomplished using an
.Pa /etc/hostname.pppoe0
file.
.Sh EXAMPLES
A typical
.Pa /etc/hostname.pppoe0
file looks like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pppoedev ne0
! /sbin/ifconfig ne0 up
! /usr/sbin/spppcontrol \e$if myauthproto=pap myauthname=testcaller \e
	myauthkey=donttell
! /sbin/ifconfig \e$if inet 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.1 netmask 0xffffffff
! /sbin/route add default 0.0.0.1
up
.Ed
.Pp
Since this is a PPP interface, the addresses assigned to the interface
may change during PPP negotiation.
There is no fine grained control available for deciding
which addresses are acceptable and which are not.
For the local side and the remote address there is exactly one choice:
hard coded address or wildcard.
If a real address is assigned to one side of the connection,
PPP negotiation will only agree to exactly this address.
If one side is wildcarded,
every address suggested by the peer will be accepted.
.Pp
To wildcard the local address set it to 0.0.0.0, to wildcard the remote
address set it to 0.0.0.1.
.Sh OPTIONS
A
.Nm
enabled kernel will not interfere with other
.Nm PPPoE
implementations running on the same machine.
Under special circumstances
(details below) this is not desirable, so the
.Nm
driver can be told to kill all unknown
.Nm PPPoE
sessions received by the Ethernet interface used for a configured
.Nm
interface.
To do this,
add the following to your kernel config file:
.Pp
.Dl option PPPOE_TERM_UNKNOWN_SESSIONS
.Pp
Note that this will break all userland
.Nm PPPoE
implementations using the same Ethernet interface!
.Pp
This option is only useful if you have a static IP address assigned and
your ISP does not use LCP echo requests to monitor the link status.
After a crash or power failure the peer device still tries to send data to
the no longer active session on your computer, and might refuse to
reestablish a new connection, because there already is an open session.
On receipt of such packets, the
.Nm
driver with this option set will send a PADT packet
(request to terminate the session).
The peer will immediately disconnect
the orphaned session and allow a new one to be established.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device appeared in
.Ox 3.7 .
.Sh BUGS
This implementation is client side only.
.Pp
It is important to specify
.Dq Li netmask 0xffffffff
to
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
If the netmask is unspecified, it will be set to 8 when 0.0.0.0 is
configured to the interface, and it will persist after negotiation.
