.Cd "wdsc* at hpc?                    " Pq sgi
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Western Digital WD33c93 and WD33c93B SCSI
controllers.
.Pp
In addition to sending the required SCSI commands to
target devices on the SCSI bus, the
.Nm
driver deals with DMA, device interrupts, sync/async negotiation,
and target disconnects/reconnects.
.Sh DEVICE FLAGS
.Bl -tag -width "Bits XX-XX" -compact
.It Bits 0-7
Disable disconnect/reselect for the corresponding target
.It Bits 8-15
Disable synchronous negotiation for target "[bit - 8]"
.It Bits 16-23
Disable tagged queuing for target "[bit - 16]"
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
device flags may be OR'd together to enable any combination of
the features listed above.
Tape devices should be allowed to disconnect for the SCSI bus to operate
acceptably.
