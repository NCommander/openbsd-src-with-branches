.Sh NAME
.Nm atu
.Nd Atmel AT76C50x 802.11b wireless network interfaces
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "# all architectures"
.Cd "atu* at uhub? port ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for wireless network adapters based around
the Atmel AT76C503, AT76C503A, AT76C505, and AT76C505A USB chipsets and four
companion radio chipsets.
.Pp
The hardware supports features including 802.11 and 802.3 frames,
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), power management,
selectable transmission rates, and both BSS and IBSS modes of operation.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver encapsulates all IP and ARP traffic as 802.11 frames, however
it can receive either 802.11 or 802.3 frames.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports Basic Service Set (BSS) operation
(also known as infrastructure mode).
This mode requires the use of an access point (also known as a base station)
to support communication between the adapter and the network.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver also supports Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS)
operation (also known as ad-hoc or point-to-point mode).
In IBSS mode stations can communicate amongst themselves without the aid of
an access point.
Note there are two different modes described as ad-hoc:
ad-hoc demo mode, which predates IEEE, is not standardised and does not
allow interoperability with cards from other vendors; and IBSS,
which is IEEE standardised and permits interoperability.
The
.Nm
driver supports IEEE standardised IBSS operation.
.Pp
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is the de facto encryption standard
for wireless networks.
It can be typically configured in one of three modes:
no encryption; 40-bit encryption; or 128-bit encryption.
Unfortunately, due to serious weaknesses in WEP protocol
it is strongly recommended that it not be used as the
sole mechanism to secure wireless communication.
WEP is not enabled by default.
.Pp
The following devices are known to be supported by the
.Nm
driver:

.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or on boot with
.Xr hostname.if 5
using the following parameters:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm bssid Ar bssid
Set the desired BSSID.
.It Fl bssid
Unset the desired BSSID.
The interface will automatically select a BSSID in this mode, which is
the default.
.It Cm chan Ar n
Set the channel (radio frequency) to be used by the adapter based on
the given channel ID
.Ar n .
.It Fl chan
Unset the desired channel to be used by the adapter.
The driver will automatically select a channel in this mode, which is
the default.
.It Cm media Ar media
The
.Nm
driver supports the following
.Ar media
types:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width autoselect -compact
.It Cm autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
.It Cm DS1
Set Direct Spread 1Mbps operation.
.It Cm DS2
Set Direct Spread 2Mbps operation.
.It Cm DS5
Set Direct Spread 5.5Mbps operation.
.It Cm DS11
Set Direct Spread 11Mbps operation.
.El
.It Cm mediaopt Ar opts
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width ibss
.It Cm ibss
Select Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS) operation.
.El
.It Fl mediaopt Ar opts
Disable the specified media options on the adapter and returns it to the
default mode of operation (BSS).
.It Cm mode Ar mode
The
.Nm
driver supports the following modes:
.Bl -tag -width 11b
.It Cm 11b
Force 802.11b operation.
.El
.It Cm nwid Ar id
Set the network ID.
The
.Ar id
can either be any text string up to 32 characters in length,
or a series of hexadecimal digits up to 64 digits.
An empty
.Ar id
string allows the interface to connect to any available access points.
By default the
.Nm
driver uses an empty string.
.It Cm nwkey Ar key
Enable WEP encryption using the specified
.Ar key .
The
.Ar key
can either be a string, a series of hexadecimal digits (preceded by
.Sq 0x ) ,
or a set of keys of the form
.Dq n:k1,k2,k3,k4 ,
where
.Sq n
specifies which of the keys will be used for transmitted packets,
and the four keys,
.Dq k1
through
.Dq k4 ,
are configured as WEP keys.
If a set of keys is specified, a comma
.Pq Sq \&,
within the key must be escaped with a backslash.
Note that if multiple keys are used, their order must be the same within
the network.
.Nm
is capable of using both 40-bit (5 characters or 10 hexadecimal digits)
or 104-bit (13 characters or 26 hexadecimal digits) keys.
.It Fl nwkey
Disable WEP encryption.
This is the default mode of operation.
.El
.Sh FILES
The adapter needs some firmware files, which are loaded on demand by the
driver when the device is attached:

.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Daan Vreeken
and ported to
.Ox
by
.An Theo de Raadt and David Gwynne .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
driver does not support a lot of the functionality available in the hardware.
More work is required to properly support the WEP, IBSS, power management
and selectable transmission rate features.
