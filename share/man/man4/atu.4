.Sh NAME
.Nm atu
.Nd Atmel at76c50x 802.11B wireless network interfaces
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "# all architectures"
.Cd "atu* at uhub? port ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for wireless network adapters based around
the Atmel at76c503, at76c503a, at76c505, and at76c505a USB chipsets.
.Pp
Supported features include 802.11 and 802.3 frames, power management, BSS,
IBSS, ad-hoc, and host-based access point mode.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver encapsulates all IP and ARP traffic as 802.11 frames, however
it can receive either 802.11 or 802.3 frames.
Transmit speed is selectable between 1Mbps fixed, 2Mbps fixed, 2Mbps
with auto fallback, 5.5Mbps, 8Mbps, or 11Mbps depending on your hardware.
.Pp
Four different radio chipsets are used along with the device, each
requiring a different firmware.
.Pp
By default, the
.Nm
driver configures the card for BSS operation (aka infrastructure
mode).
This mode requires the use of an access point (base station).
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
The following devices are among those supported by the
.Nm
driver:

.It Tn Atmel 2662W-V4
.It Tn Atmel DWL-120
.It Tn AcerP AWL-300
.El
.Sh FILES
The driver needs a couple of firmware files which are loaded on
demand when the device is attached.
