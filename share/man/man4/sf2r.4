.Cd "radio* at sf2r0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the SF16-FMR2 FM radio tuners.
.Pp
The SF16-FMR2 is a stereo FM tuner that allows to tune in the range
87.5 - 108.0 MHz, report signal status on the current frequency, force
audio output to mono, perform hardware signal search, and has an internal
AFC.
.Pp
The SF16-FMR2 cards take only one I/O port.
The I/O port is set by the driver to the value specified in the configuration
file and must be 0x384.
.Sh BUGS
MediaForte made two variants of the SF16-FMR2 cards, the first one has
an internal amplifier of the output sound, the second one does not have
such an amplifier.
The current driver supports only the second variant.
