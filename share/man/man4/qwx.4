.Sh NAME
.Nm qwx
.Nd Qualcomm IEEE 802.11a/ac/ax/b/g/n wireless network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "qwx* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Qualcomm Technologies QCNFA765
802.11ax devices.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or on boot with
.Xr hostname.if 5 .
.Sh FILES
The driver needs the following firmware files,
which are loaded when an interface is brought up:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Pa /etc/firmware/qwx-wcn6855-hw2.0-amms
.It Pa /etc/firmware/qwx-wcn6855-hw2.0-board-2
.It Pa /etc/firmware/qwx-wcn6855-hw2.0-m3
.It Pa /etc/firmware/qwx-wcn6855-hw2.0-regdb
.It Pa /etc/firmware/qwx-wcn6855-hw2.1-amms
.It Pa /etc/firmware/qwx-wcn6855-hw2.1-board-2
.It Pa /etc/firmware/qwx-wcn6855-hw2.1-m3
.It Pa /etc/firmware/qwx-wcn6855-hw2.1-regdb
.El
.Pp
These firmware files are not free because Qualcomm refuses to grant
distribution rights without contractual obligations.
As a result, even though
.Ox
includes the driver, the firmware files cannot be included and
users have to download these files on their own.
.Pp
A prepackaged version of the firmware can be installed using
.Xr fw_update 8 .
