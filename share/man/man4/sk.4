.El
.Pp
The SysKonnect based adapters consist of two main components: the
XaQti Corp.\&
XMAC II Gigabit MAC (sk) and the SysKonnect GEnesis controller ASIC (skc).
The XMAC provides the Gigabit MAC and PHY support
while the GEnesis provides an interface to the PCI bus, DMA support,
packet buffering and arbitration.
The GEnesis can control up to two XMACs simultaneously,
allowing dual-port NIC configurations.
.Pp
The Marvell based adapters are a single integrated circuit, but are
still presented as a separate MAC (sk) and controller ASIC (skc).
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver configures dual port SysKonnect adapters such that each XMAC
is treated as a separate logical network interface.
Both ports can operate independently of each other and can be connected
to separate networks.
.Pp
The XaQti XMAC II supports full and half duplex operation with
autonegotiation.
The XMAC also supports a frame size of up to 9000 bytes.
Support for Jumbo frames is provided via the interface MTU setting.
Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
utility configures the adapter to transmit Jumbo frames.
Using Jumbo frames can greatly improve performance for certain tasks,
such as file transfers and data streaming.
.Pp
Hardware receive IP checksum offload for IPv4 is supported.
.Pp
The following media types and options (as given to
.Xr ifconfig 8 )
are supported:
.Bl -tag -width xxx -offset indent
.It Cm media No autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the appropriate
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.It Cm media No 1000baseSX Cm mediaopt No full-duplex
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation on fiber and force full-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 1000baseSX Cm mediaopt No half-duplex
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation on fiber and force half-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 1000baseT Cm mediaopt No full-duplex
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation and force full-duplex mode.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
To view a list of media types and options supported by the card, try
.Ic ifconfig -m <device> .
For example,
.Ic ifconfig -m sk0 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "sk%d: can't map mem space"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "sk%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "sk%d: no memory for jumbo buffer queue!"
The driver failed to allocate memory for jumbo frames during
initialization.
.It "sk%d: watchdog timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
