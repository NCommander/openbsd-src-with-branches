.Sh INTRODUCTION
The
.Nm
subsystem provides machine-independent bus support and
drivers for PCMCIA (PC Card)
devices.
.Sh SUPPORTED DEVICES
The following devices are supported, sorted by function
and driver name:
.Ss Miscellaneous
.Bl -tag -width speaker -offset ind -compact
.It Xr gpr 4
GemPlus GPR400 smartcard reader.
.El
.Ss Serial interfaces and modems
.Bl -tag -width speaker -offset ind -compact
.It Xr com 4 , Xr pccom 4
8250/16450/16550-compatible PCMCIA serial cards and modems.
.El
.Ss Network interfaces
.Bl -tag -width speaker -offset ind -compact
.It Xr an 4

.El
.Ss IDE controllers
.Bl -tag -width speaker -offset ind -compact
.It Xr wdc 4
Devices which implement an ATA/IDE interface, such as mini disk drives,
CDROMs.
This includes Compact Flash cards which emulate a disk drive.
.El
.Pp
The supported PCMCIA controllers are those that are i82365 compatible.
.Sh NOTES
On some
.Nm
adapters, for instance the
.Xr sbus 4 Ns -based
.Xr stp 4 ,
the
.Nm
bus will be mapped in big-endian format instead of the natural (and
preferred) little endian format.
Unfortunately such controllers lack the hardware facility to swap bytes,
and it is not efficient to convert all drivers to always know about this.
While 8 bit drivers can invisibly work on such a bus, 16 bit
drivers will need modification to handle this.
So far,
.Xr wi 4
is the only driver to require these modifications.
.Pp
If the
.Nm
adapter is not detected, or if
.Nm
events (such as card insertion) do not occur, there may be a
.Tn PCI
card BIOS mapped in the same memory space the
.Nm
driver is configured to use (this is often the case with ethernet
card boot ROMs).
The output from
.Xr dmesg 8
should contain a line beginning with
.Dq bios0
that lists the memory address and size of mapped regions.
If there is a conflict, you can use
.Xr boot_config 8
to change the iomem parameter of the
.Em pcic
device to a non-overlapping address, such as 0xd8000 for
.Em pcic0 .
Some experimentation may be required to find a working value; in some
cases the size parameter of the
.Em pcic
device may need to be decreased to avoid a conflict.
