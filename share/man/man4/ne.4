.Sh MEDIA SELECTION
The RealTek 8019 (ISA, ISAPnP, some PCMCIA) and RealTek 8029 (PCI)
NE2000-compatible Ethernet chips include support for software media
selection.
If one of these chips is detected by the driver, the list of supported media
will be displayed.
.Pp
For all other chips supported by the
.Nm
driver, media selection must be performed either via card jumper settings or
by vendor-supplied configuration programs.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "ne0: where did the card go?"
The driver found the card, but was unable to make the card respond
to complete the configuration sequence.
