Aironet Communications 4500/4800 wireless network adapter driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device an"
.Cd "device an0 at isa? port 0x140 irq 5"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Aironet Communications 4500 and 4800
wireless network adapters.
This includes the ISA, PCI and PCMCIA
varieties.
The 4500 series adapters operate at 1 and 2Mbps while
the 4800 series can operate at 1, 2, 5.5 and 11Mbps.
The ISA, PCI
and PCMCIA devices are all based on the same core PCMCIA modules
and all have the same programming interface, however unlike the
Lucent WaveLAN/IEEE cards, the ISA and PCI cards appear to the
host as normal ISA and PCI devices and no not require any PCCARD
support.
.Pp
The PCMCIA Aironet cards require pccard support, including the
kernel pccard driver support and the
.Xr pccardd 8
daemon.
ISA cards can either be configured to use ISA Plug and Play
or to use a particular I/O address and IRQ
by properly setting the DIP switches on the board.
(The default
switch setting is for plug and play.)
The
.Nm
driver has Plug and Play support and will work in either configuration,
however when using a hard-wired I/O address and IRQ, the driver
configuration and the NIC's switch settings must agree.
PCI cards
require no switch settings of any kind and will be automatically
probed and attached.
.Pp
All host/device interaction with the Aironet cards is via programmed I/O.
The Aironet devices support 802.11 and 802.3 frames, power management,
BSS (infrastructure) and IBSS (ad-hoc) operation modes.
The
.Nm
driver encapsulates all IP and ARP traffic as 802.11 frames, however
it can receive either 802.11 or 802.3 frames.
Transmit speed is
selectable between 1Mbps, 2Mbps, 5.5Mbps, 11Mbps or
"auto" (the NIC automatically chooses the best speed).
.Pp
By default, the
.Nm
driver configures the Aironet card for ad-hoc operation with an SSID
of "ANY."
In this mode,
stations can communicate among each other without the aid of an access
point.
To join a service set, the driver must be set for BSS mode using
the
.Xr ancontrol 8
utility.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "an%d: init failed"
The Aironet card failed to come ready after an initialization command was
issued.
.It "an%d: failed to allocate %d bytes on NIC"
The driver was unable to allocate memory for transmit frames in the
NIC's on-board RAM.
.It "an%d: device timeout"
The Aironet card failed to generate an interrupt to acknowledge a transmit
command.
