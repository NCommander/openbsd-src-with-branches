.Sh NAME
.Nm an
.Nd Aironet Communications 4500/4800 IEEE 802.11FH/b wireless network driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "an* at pcmcia?"
.Cd "an* at pci?"
.Cd "an* at isapnp?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Aironet Communications 4500, 4800
(aka Cisco 340), and Cisco 350
IEEE 802.11 wireless network adapters.
This includes the ISA, PCI, and PCMCIA varieties.
The 4500 series adapters operate at 1 and 2Mbps (FH) while
the 4800 and 350 series can operate at 1, 2, 5.5, and 11Mbps (DS).
The ISA, PCI,
and PCMCIA devices are all based on the same core PCMCIA modules
and all have the same programming interface.
However, unlike the
Lucent WaveLAN/IEEE cards, the ISA and PCI cards appear to the
host as normal ISA and PCI devices and do not require any PCMCIA
support.
.Pp
ISA cards can either be configured to use ISA Plug and Play
or to use a particular I/O address and IRQ
by properly setting the DIP switches on the board.
(The default switch setting is for plug and play.)
The
.Nm
driver has Plug and Play support and will work in either configuration,
however when using a hard-wired I/O address and IRQ, the driver
configuration and the NIC's switch settings must agree.
PCI cards
require no switch settings of any kind and will be automatically
probed and attached.
.Pp
All host/device interaction with the Aironet cards is via programmed I/O.
The
.Nm
driver encapsulates all IP and ARP traffic as 802.11 frames, though
it can receive either 802.11 or 802.3 frames.
.Pp
These are the modes the
.Nm
driver can operate in:
.Bl -tag -width "IBSS-masterXX"
.It BSS mode
Also known as
.Em infrastructure
mode, this is used when associating with an access point, through
which all traffic passes.
This mode is the default.
.It IBSS mode
Also known as
.Em IEEE ad-hoc
mode or
.Em peer-to-peer
mode.
This is the standardized method of operating without an access point.
Stations associate with a service set.
However, actual connections between stations are peer-to-peer.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
supports hardware WEP.
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is the de facto encryption standard
for wireless networks.
It can be typically configured in one of three modes:
no encryption; 40-bit encryption; or 104-bit encryption.
Unfortunately, due to serious weaknesses in WEP protocol
it is strongly recommended that it not be used as the
sole mechanism to secure wireless communication.
WEP is not enabled by default.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured using
.Xr ancontrol 8
or on boot with
.Xr hostname.if 5 .
.Sh EXAMPLES
Note that when setting options via
.Xr ancontrol 8
in a
.Xr hostname.if 5
file (e.g.\&
.Pa /etc/hostname.an0 ) ,
the
.Xr ancontrol 8
commands should be specified first.
.Pp
The following
.Xr hostname.if 5
example will set the channel to 11 and enable WEP before configuring
the interface as an IBSS peer:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
!/sbin/ancontrol \e$if -c 11 -W 1 -k 0x1deadbeef1 -n my_net -o 0
inet 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 NONE
.Ed
.Pp
Enable WEP:
.Pp
.Dl # ancontrol an0 -W 1
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "an%d: init failed"
The Aironet card failed to come ready after an initialization command was
issued.
.It "an%d: failed to allocate %d bytes on NIC"
The driver was unable to allocate memory for transmit frames in the
NIC's on-board RAM.
.It "an%d: device timeout"
The Aironet card failed to generate an interrupt to acknowledge a transmit
command.
