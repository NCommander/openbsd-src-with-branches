.Sh NAME
.Nm cpu
.Nd Central Processing Unit
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "cpu0 at mainbus?"
.Cd "cpu* at mainbus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Several processor models have additional features that extend their base
functionality, such as power and frequency control.
.Sh FREQUENCY CONTROL
The
.Xr sysctl 3
hw.cpuspeed will return the current operating frequency of the processor
(on some processors this value may be an approximation).
If possible, speed may be adjusted by altering hw.setperf from 0 to 100,
representing percentage of maximum speed.
There is only one possible implementation for setperf, transparent
to the user:
.Bl -tag -width tenletters
.It PowerNow
Found on various AMD processors.
Currently only supports a limited set of models in the K8 families.
