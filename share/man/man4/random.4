.Sh NAME
.Nm random ,
.Nm urandom
.Nd random data source device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In dev/rndvar.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm urandom
device produces high quality pseudo-random output data without ever
blocking, even immediately after booting.
Entropy data is collected from system activity (such as disk, network,
and clock device interrupts), and then used to key a stream cipher
to generate the output.
.Pp
The
.Nm urandom
device is intended to be used in scripts.
In C programs, use the
.Xr arc4random 3
family of functions instead, which can be called in almost all
coding environments, including
.Xr pthreads 3 ,
.Xr chroot 2 ,
and
.Xr pledge 2 ,
and which avoids accessing a device every time.
.Pp
Never use
.Pa /dev/random .
On
.Ox ,
it does the same as
.Pa /dev/urandom ,
but on many other systems, it misbehaves.
For example, it may block, directly return entropy instead of using
a stream cipher, or only return data from hardware random generators.

.Xr arc4random 9
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
device first appeared in Linux in 1994.
The
.Nm random
and
.Nm urandom
devices have been available since
.Ox 2.0 .
.Sh BUGS
No randomness testing suite provided.
