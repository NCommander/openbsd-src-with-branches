.Sh NAME
.Nm random ,
.Nm arandom
.Nd random data source devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <dev/rndvar.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The various
.Nm
devices produce random output data with different random qualities.
Entropy data is collected from system activity (like disk, network,
and clock device interrupts and such), and then run through various
hash or message digest functions to generate the output.
All the random devices are expected to provide high quality
pseudo-random output data.
.Pp
The
.Xr arc4random 3
function in userland libraries seeds itself from this device (or with
the
.Xr sysctl 3
interface),
providing a second level of ARC4 hashed data without the need to access
these devices every time.

This is a cloned interface.
