.Sh NAME
.Nm random ,
.Nm arandom
.Nd random data source devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <dev/rndvar.h>
.Fd #include <dev/rndioctl.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The various
.Nm
devices produce random output data with different random qualities.
Entropy data is collected from system activity (like disk and
network device interrupts and such), and then run through various
hash or message digest functions to generate the output.
.Bl -hang -width /dev/arandomX
.It Pa /dev/random
This device is reserved for future support of hardware
random generators.
.It Pa /dev/arandom
As required, entropy pool data re-seeds an ARC4 generator,
which then generates high-quality pseudo-random output data.
.Pp
The
.Xr arc4random 3
function in userland libraries seeds itself from this device,
providing a second level of ARC4 hashed data.

.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
device first appeared in the Linux operating system.
This is a cloned interface.
.Pp
Previous versions of
.Ox
included the
.Nm srandom
and
.Nm urandom
devices.
These interfaces have been deprecated and replaced with
.Nm arandom .
.Pp
ARC4 routines added by David Mazieres.
.Sh BUGS
No randomness testing suite provided.
