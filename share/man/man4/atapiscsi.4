.Sh NAME
.Nm atapiscsi
.Nd ATAPI<->SCSI adapter
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "atapiscsi* at wdc? channel ?"
.Cd "atapiscsi* at pciide? channel ?"
.Cd "scsibus* at atapiscsi?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
driver supports ATAPI (also called IDE) devices such as CD-ROMs, ZIP drives,
floppy drives, and (eventually) tape drives.  All ATAPI devices talk some
subset of the SCSI protocol. For example, the SCSI 
.Xr cd 4 ,
.Xr sd 4 ,
and
.Xr st 4
drivers are able to sucessfully control the corresponding ATAPI devices.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver acts like a SCSI adapter.  Thus, the ATAPI devices connected to
the system will appear as SCSI devices.
.Pp
For performance reasons, one should avoid putting an ATAPI device and
a hard disk on the same cable.  The driver does not support bus release
and, even if it did, many ATAPI devices do not support it. There is
only one command outstanding on a cable at a time. For example, if a
a hard disk and a CD drive are placed on the same cable, the hard disk
requests may get queued behind slower CD operations.
.Sh BUGS
Tape devices don't work yet.
