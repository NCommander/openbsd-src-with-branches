.Sh NAME
.Nm intro
.Nd introduction to special files and hardware support
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The manual pages in section 4 describe the special files, 
related driver functions, and networking support
available in the system.
In this part of the manual, the
.Tn SYNOPSIS
section of
each configurable device gives a sample specification
for use in constructing a system description for the
.Xr config 8
program.
The
.Tn DIAGNOSTICS
section lists messages which may appear on the console
and/or in the system error log
.Pa /var/log/messages
due to errors in device operation;
see
.Xr syslogd 8
for more information.
.Pp
This section contains both devices
which may be configured into the system
and network related information.
The networking support is introduced in
.Xr netintro 4 .
.Sh DEVICE SUPPORT
This section describes the hardware supported on the PowerPC
platform.
Software support for these devices comes in two forms.  A hardware
device may be supported with a character or block
.Em device driver ,
or it may be used within the networking subsystem and have a
.Em network interface driver .
Character and block
devices are accessed through files in the file
system of a special type; see
.Xr mknod 8 .
Network interfaces are indirectly accessed through the interprocess
communication facilities provided by the system; see
.Xr socket 2 .
.Pp
A hardware device is identified to the system at configuration time
and the appropriate device or network interface driver is then compiled
into the system.  When the resultant system is booted, the
autoconfiguration facilities in the system probe for the device
and, if found, enable the software support for it.
If a device does not respond at autoconfiguration
time it is not accessible at any time afterwards.
To enable a device which did not autoconfigure,
the system must be rebooted.
.Pp
A list of the supported devices is given below.

.Xr config 8
.Sh SUPPORTED SYSTEMS
The following PowerPC models are 
.Em supported:
.Pp
PowerMac G4
.br
PowerMac Dual G4
.br
PowerMac G4 Cube
.br
iMac Rev A
.br
iMac Rev B
.br
iMac Rev C

.br
iMac DV+
.br
PowerBook G3 (FireWire)
.br
PowerBook G4
.br
iBook (only limited testing)
.br
StarMax (development in progress)
.Pp
The following are 
.Em not supported:
.Pp
Support for older PREP style machines has been removed; lack of availability
of the hardware and relatively slow speed compared to more recent machines has
contributed to this decision.
.Pp
Apple PowerMac systems with a 601 processor or lack OpenFirmware will likely
never be supported.
.Pp
At the current time, older OpenFirmware machines are not supported. This is
mostly due to lack of developer resources to work onthe support in addition
to limited availability of hardware.
.Sh LIST OF DEVICES
The devices listed below are supported in this incarnation of
the system.  Devices are indicated by their functional interface.
