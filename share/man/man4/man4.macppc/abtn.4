.Sh NAME
.Nm abtn 
.Nd apple brightness/volume button control
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "abtn at adb?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
driver allows you to dim the brightness of your display.  This driver only
currently recognizes the dim and brightness button.  Sound, numlock and
eject buttons are also handled by this driver but are silently ignored.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr adb 4, 
.Xr aed 4
.Sh AUTHOR
abtn was written by Tsubai Masanari for
.Nx .
.Sh BUGS
The bright/dim buttons currently don't work on new 2001 iBooks.  It's best
to just disable the driver to avoid freeze ups when pressing these buttons.
