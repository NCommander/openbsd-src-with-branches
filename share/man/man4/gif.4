.Sh NAME
.Nm gif
.Nd
.Tn Generic tunnel interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device gif 4"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface is a generic tunnelling pseudo-device for IPv4 and IPv6.
It can tunnel IPv[46] traffic over IPv[46], for a total of four
possible combinations.
The behavior of
.Nm
is mainly based on RFC1933 IPv6-over-IPv4 configured tunnel.
.Pp
To use
.Nm gif ,
the administrator needs to configure the addresses used for the outer header.
This can be done by using
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,
or through the
.Dv SIOCSIFPHYADDR
ioctl.
The administrator needs to also configure the addresses used for the
inner header, by using
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
Note that IPv6 link-local address
.Pq those start with Li fe80::
will be automatically configured whenever possible.
One may need to remove any IPv6 link-local address manually using
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,
to disable the use of IPv6 as inner header
.Pq e.g., when a pure IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel is required .
Finally, the routing table may be used to route the packets toward the
.Nm
interface.
.\"
.Ss Backward compatibility
The
.Nm
interface will capture packets toward a IPv4-in-IPv4 tunnel used by a
.Xr tun 4 
multicast tunnel device
.Pq used in MBone community .
For compatibility, IPv4-in-IPv4 traffic will be matched to
.Nm
interfaces first, then sent to
.Xr tun 4
if no match is found.
