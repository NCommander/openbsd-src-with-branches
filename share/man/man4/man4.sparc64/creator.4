.Sh NAME
.Nm creator
.Nd accelerated color frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "creator* at mainbus0"
.Cd "creator* at upa0"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at creator?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a memory based color frame buffer driver for the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework and for the Creator, Creator 3D and Elite 3D UPA
framebuffers.
It does not provide direct device driver entry points but makes its functions
available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr upa 4 ,
.Xr wscons 4 ,
.Xr wsdisplay 4
.Sh BUGS
There is no support for the acceleration this hardware provides, so
some operations are quite slow.
