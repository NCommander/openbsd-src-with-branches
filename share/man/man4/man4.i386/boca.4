(The BB2016 is functionally equivalent to two BB1008 boards,
and is configured as such.)
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm boca
driver provides support for BOCA Research BB1004, BB1008 and BB2016
boards that multiplex together up to four, eight or sixteen
.Tn EIA
.Tn RS-232C
.Pf ( Tn CCITT
.Tn V.28 )
communications interfaces.
.Pp
Each
.Nm
device is the master device for up to eight 
.Nm com
devices.  The kernel configuration specifies these
.Nm com
devices as slave devices of the
.Nm
device, as shown in the synopsis.  The slave ID given for each
.Nm com
device determines which bit in the interrupt multiplexing register is
tested to find interrupts for that device.
The
.Tn port
specification for the
.Nm
device is used to compute the base addresses for the
.Nm com
subdevices and the port for the interrupt multiplexing register.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was written by Charles Hannum, based on the
.Nm ast
driver and source code from David Muir Sharnoff.  David wishes to
acknowledge the assistance of Jason Venner in determining how to use
the BOCA boards.
