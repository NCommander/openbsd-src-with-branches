.Cd "msr0 at mainbus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device provides access to the Model Specific Registers (MSR) of AMD K6
CPUs.
.Ss IOCTL INTERFACE
MSRs can read or written via
.Fn ioctl
calls performed on
.Pa /dev/amdmsr .
Declarations and data types are to be found in
.Aq Pa machine/amdmsr.h .
.Pp
Read or write requests are performed using:
.Bd -literal -offset xxxx
struct amdmsr_req {
	u_int32_t addr;	/* 32-bit MSR address */
	u_int64_t val;	/* 64-bit MSR value */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fa RDMSR
ioctl is used to read an MSR register.
.Pp
The
.Fa WRMSR
ioctl is used to write an MSR register.
