device driver supports the Etherepress PRO/10 card, and might support
other ISA cards using the same chip.

Various models of these cards come with a different assortment of
connectors:

.El
.Pp
The default port to use is the port the card autodetects at 
.Xr ifconfig up
time. To choose an alternate port,
use the following flag combinations with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or in your /etc/hostname.iy? file.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It -link0 -link1
Use the autodetected port (default).
