.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm bios
.Nd a driver for PC Firmware, aka BIOS
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "bios0    at mainbus0 flags 0x0000"
.Cd "apm0     at bios0 flags 0x0000"
.Cd "pcibios0 at bios0 flags 0x0000"
.Sh INTRODUCTION
.Ox
provides support for PC firmware, aka BIOS and some of its functions,
currently: APM subsystem, BIOS 32 extensions, PCI BIOS subsystem.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver also identifies BIOS type (such as "AT/286+", which is
almost always used in modern machines) and BIOS image date stamp,
which is, presumably, the day bios image was compiled by vendor
and could be used as a crude BIOS version identification.
The
.Nm
driver also scans the ISA memory hole at 640K-1M for optional
ROM images and reserves the space from being used by various
isa devices, for example
.Xr pcic 4 .
.Pp
Flags is a bit mask each bit of which specifies which functions
of the driver to disable.
.Bl -tag -width 0x0001
.It 0x0001
BIOS 32 attachment.
.Pp
Do not probe and attach to BIOS 32 extensions, which is one of
the interfaces to the PCI BIOS configuration tables.
.It 0x0002
PCI BIOS attachment.
.Pp
Do not probe and attach the
.Xr pcibios 4
device, which performs certain PCI configuration tasks.
.It 0x0004
Do not perform the scan for ROM images in the ISA memory hole
(0xc0000 - 0xf0000 physical addresses).

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr apm 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pcibios 4 ,
.Xr pcmcia 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver
appeared in
.Ox 2.2 .
.Sh BUGS
On some machines optional ROM images do not pass checksum check,
but it's considered better to reserve space for those anyway,
choosing lesser evil from many.
