.Sh NAME
.Nm fdc
.Nd NEC765 compatible floppy disk driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "fdc0 at isa? port 0x3f0 irq 6 drq 2"
.Cd "fd* at fdc? drive ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm fdc
driver supports the standard AT floppy 
disk controllers. These include standard IDE, MFM, RLL,
EIDE, ESDI and SCSI controllers with floppy attachment.
.Pp
When using the
.Nm fdc
driver with
.Nm disklabel
the last letter is used to indicate the floppy size:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It a: default (probed) geometry of drive, max supported.
.It b: 1.44MB
.It c: 1.2MB
.It d: 360KB/AT (360KB disk in a 1.2 MB drive)
.It e: 360KB/PC (360KB drive)
.It f: 720KB
.It g: 720KB/x (720KB in a 1.2 MB drive)
.It h: 360KB/x (360KB in a 720KB drive)
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm fdc 
driver can interfere with other controllers namely some WD/SMC
network controllers fail to work when the probing mechanism
in the 
.Nm fdc 
driver probes for a missing second floppy drive.
In this case you should try recompiling the kernel with
the replacing the relevant line with
.Cd "fd0 at fdc? drive ?".
