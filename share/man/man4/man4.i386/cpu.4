.Sh NAME
.Nm cpu
.Nd Central Processing Unit
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "option I386_CPU"
.Cd "option I486_CPU"
.Cd "option I586_CPU"
.Cd "option I686_CPU"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Several processor models have additional features that extend their base
functionality, such as power and frequency control or additonal instructions.
.Sh FREQUENCY CONTROL
The
.Xr sysctl 3
hw.cpuspeed will return the current operating frequency of the processor.
If possible, speed may be adjusted by altering hw.setperf from 0 to 100,
representing percentage of maximum speed.
There are several possible implementations for setperf, all transparent
to the user.
In systems with more than one control capability, they are preferred in the
order given.
.Bl -tag -width tenletters
.It LongRun
Found on Transmeta Crusoe processors, offers frequency scaling with numerous
positions.
The processor dynamically adjusts frequency in response to load, the setperf
value is interpreted as the maximum.
.It EST
Enhanced SpeedStep found on Intel Pentium M processors,
offers frequency scaling with numerous positions.
.It SpeedStep
Found on some Intel Pentium 3 and newer mobile chips,
it is capable of adjusting frequency between a low and high value.
Only enabled on some chipsets.
.It TCC
Thermal Control Circuit found on Intel Pentium 4 and newer processors,
adjusts processor duty cycle in 12.5 percent increments.
.El
.Sh INSTRUCTION SET EXTENSIONS
The presence of extended instruction sets can be determined by
sysctl machdep.
.Bl -tag -width "tenletters"
.It osfxsr
Supports the fxsave instruction.
.It sse
Supports the SSE instruction set.
.It sse2
Supports the SSE2 instruction set.
.It xcrypt
Support the VIA AES encryption instruction set.
If this is supported, the
.Li libcrypto
EVP AES functions will automatically use this support.
