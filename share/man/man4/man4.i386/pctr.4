.Sh NAME
.Nm pctr
.Nd driver for cpu performance counters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd pseudo-device pctr
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device provides access to the performance counters on Intel brand processors,
and to the TSC on others.
.Pp
Intel processors have two 40-bit performance
counters which can be programmed to count events such as cache misses,
branch target buffer hits, TLB misses, dual-issues, interrupts,
pipeline flushes, and more.
.Pp
There is one
.Em ioctl
call to read the status of all counters, and one
.Em ioctl
call to program the function of each counter.  All require the
following includes:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <machine/cpu.h>
#include <machine/pctr.h>
.Ed

The current state of all counters can be read with the
.Dv PCIOCRD
.Em ioctl ,
which takes an argument of type
.Dv "struct pctrst" :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#define PCTR_NUM 2
struct pctrst {
	u_int pctr_fn[PCTR_NUM];
	pctrval pctr_tsc;
	pctrval pctr_hwc[PCTR_NUM];
	pctrval pctr_idl;
};
.Ed

In this structure,
.Dv ctr_fn
contains the functions of the two counters, as previously set by the
.Dv PCIOCS0
and
.Dv PCIOCS1
ioctls (see bellow).
.Dv pctr_hwc
contains the actual value of the two hardware counters.
.Dv pctr_tsc
is a free-running, 64-bit cycle counter.  Finally,
.Dv pctr_idl
is a 64-bit count of idle-loop iterations.

The functions of the two counters can be programmed with ioctls
.Dv PCIOCS0
and
.Dv PCIOCS1 ,
which require a writeable file descriptor and take an argument of type
.Dv "unsigned int" . \&
The meaning of this integer is dependent on the particular CPU.
.\" The
.\" following procedure can be used to determine which counters are
.\" available on a given cpu:
.\" .Bd -literal -offset indent
.\" ctrval id = __cpuid();
.\" if (__hasp5ctr(id)) {
.\"	/* The machine has Pentium counters */
.\" } else if (__hasp6ctr(id)) {
.\"	/* The machine has Pentium Pro counters */
.\" } else if (__hastsc(id)) {
.\"	/* The machine just has a time stamp counter */
.\" } else {
.\"	/* No counters at all */
.\"}
.\" .Ed
.Ss Time stamp counter
The time stamp counter is available on all machines with Pentium and
Pentium Pro counters, as well as on some 486s and non-intel CPUs.  It
is set to zero at boot time, and then increments with each cycle.
Because the counter is 64-bits wide, it does not overflow.
.Pp
The time stamp counter can be read directly from user-mode using
the
.Fn rdtsc
macro, which returns a 64-bit value of type
.Dv pctrval .
The following example illustrates a simple use of
.Dv rdtsc
to measure the execution time of a hypothetical subroutine called
.Fn functionx :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
void
time_functionx(void)
{
	pctrval tsc;

	tsc = rdtsc();
	functionx();
	tsc = rdtsc() - tsc;
	printf ("Functionx took %qd cycles.\en", tsc);
}
.Ed
.Pp
The value of the time stamp counter is also returned by the
.Dv PCIOCRD
.Em ioctl ,
so that one can get an exact timestamp on readings of the hardware
event counters.
.Ss Pentium counters
The Pentium counters are programmed with a 9 bit function.  The top
three bits contain the following flags:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width P5CTR_C
.It Dv P5CTR_K
Enables counting of events that occur in kernel mode.
.It Dv P5CTR_U
Enables counting of events that occur in user mode.  You must set at
least one of
.Dv P5CTR_U
and
.Dv P5CTR_K
to count anything.
.It Dv P5CTR_C
When this flag is set, the counter attempts to count the number of
cycles spent servicing a particular event, rather than simply the
number of occurrences of that event.
.El
.Pp
The bottom 6 bits set the particular event counted.  Here is the event
type of each permissible value for the bottom 6 bits of the counter
function:

.Ss Pentium Pro counters
The Pentium Pro counter functions contain several parts.  The most
significant byte (an 8-bit integer shifted left by
.Dv P6CTR_CM_SHIFT )
contains a
.Em "counter mask" . \&
If non-zero, this sets a threshold for the number of times an event
must occur in one cycle for the counter to be incremented.  The
.Em "counter mask"
can therefore be used to count cycles in which an event
occurs at least some number of times.
The next byte contains several flags:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width P6CTR_EN
.It Dv P6CTR_U
Enables counting of events that occur in user mode.
.It Dv P6CTR_K
Enables counting of events that occur in kernel mode.  You must set at
least one of
.Dv P6CTR_K
and
.Dv P6CTR_U
to count anything.
.It Dv P6CTR_E
Counts edges rather than cycles.  For some functions this allows you
to get an estimate of the number of events rather than the number of
cycles occupied by those events.
.It Dv P6CTR_EN
Enable counters.  This bit must be set in the function for counter 0
in order for either of the counters to be enabled.  This bit should
probably be set in counter 1 as well.
.It Dv P6CTR_I
Inverts the sense of the
.Em "counter mask" . \&
When this bit is set, the counter only increments on cycles in which
there are no
.Em more
events than specified in the
.Em "counter mask" .
.El
.Pp
The next byte, also known as the
.Em "unit mask" ,
contains flags specific to the event being counted.  For events
dealing with the L2 cache, the following flags are valid:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width P6CTR_UM_M
.It Dv P6CTR_UM_M
Count events involving modified cache lines.
.It Dv P6CTR_UM_E
Count events involving exclusive cache lines.
.It Dv P6CTR_UM_S
Count events involving shared cache lines.
.It Dv P6CTR_UM_I
Count events involving invalid cache lines.
.El
To measure all L2 cache activity, all these bits should be set.  They
can be set with the macro
.Dv P6CTR_UM_MESI
which contains the bitwise or of all of the above.
.Pp
For event types dealing with bus transactions, there is another flag
that can be set in the
.Em "unit mask" :
.Bl -tag -width P6CTR_UM_A
.It Dv P6CTR_UM_A
Count all appropriate bus events, not just those initiated by the
processor.
.El
.Pp
Finally, the least significant byte of the counter function is the
event type to count.  The following values are available:

Events marked /mesi require the
.Dv P6CTR_UM_[MESI]
bits in the
.Em "unit mask" . \&
Events marked /a can take the
.Dv P6CTR_UM_A
bit.
.Pp
Unlike the Pentium counters, the Pentium Pro counters can be read
directly from user-mode without need to invoke the kernel.  The macro
.Fn rdpmc ctr
takes 0 or 1 as an argument to specify a counter, and returns that
counter's 40-bit value (which will be of type
.Dv pctrval ) .
This is generally preferable to making a system call as it introduces
less distortion in measurements.  However, you should be aware of the
possibility of an interrupt between invocations of
.Fn rdpmc
and/or
.Fn rdtsc .
