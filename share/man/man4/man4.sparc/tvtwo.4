.Sh NAME
.Nm tvtwo
.Nd accelerated 24-bit color frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "tvtwo* at sbus? slot ? offset ?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at tvtwo?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a memory based color frame buffer, with graphics acceleration
and overlay capabilities, and hardware MPEG decoding.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver interfaces the frame buffer to the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
It does not provide direct device driver entry points
but makes its functions available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.

.Sh CAVEATS
This driver does not support any acceleration features at the moment.
Thus, vertical scrolling in console mode is abysmally slow in 24 bit mode.
