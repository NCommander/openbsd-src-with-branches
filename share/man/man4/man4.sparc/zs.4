.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
is a Zilog 8530 serial interface chip used in Sun workstations.
The Zilog 8530 provides two input/output channels per instance. 
Most Sun workstations include two of these interfaces.  One of the
interfaces is hardwired for use by the keyboard and mouse attached to
the workstation console.  
The remaining additional
.Nm 
interfaces provide RS-423
and RS-232 serial ports for general purpose use.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports all of the standard
.Xr tty 4
ioctl calls.
The status of the DTR, RTS, CTS, and DCD signals can be queried with
TIOCMGET command, but, due to limitations in the hardware, 
only the DTR and RTS signals can be modified with TIOCMSET, TIOCMBIC,
and TIOCMBIS
.Xr ioctl 2
commands.
.Sh BUGS
The 
.Nm
driver does not support cua minor devices (yet).

.Sh HISTORY
The 
.Nm
driver first appeared in 
.Bx 4.4 .
Support for the TIOCM* ioctl's appeared in
.Ox 2.3 .
