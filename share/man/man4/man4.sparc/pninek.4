.Sh NAME
.Nm pninek
.Nd Weitek Power9000 accelerated frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "btcham0 at obio?"
.Cd "pninek0 at sbus? flags 0x0"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at pninek?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a color frame buffer with graphics acceleration, embedded in the
.Tn "Tadpole SPARCbook"
3 laptop.
It is based on the
.Tn "Weitek Power9000"
video processor and a
.Tn Brooktree
Bt445
.Sq Chameleon
RAMDAC.
.Pp
Due to specifics of the video hardware on the
.Tn Tadpole SPARCbook
3, the complete driver is split in two parts:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.It Nm btcham
RAMDAC interface
.It Nm pninek
Video controller interface
.El
.Pp
The combination of both
.Nm btcham
and
.Nm
drivers interfaces the frame buffer with the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
They do not provide direct device driver entry points
but make their function available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.
.Pp
If the
.Xr tctrl 4
device is also configured, the
.Nm
will be powered down when the lid of the laptop
is closed or the screen is blanked.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports hardware acceleration to erase the screen and scroll text.
By default, acceleration is
.Em not
enabled.
By setting
.Ar flags
to 1
(via
.Xr config 8
or
.Xr boot_config 8 )
this acceleration can be enabled.

.Sh BUGS
There is currently no way to switch back and forth from
the onboard display to the external connector.
.Pp
It is not possible to change resolutions.
