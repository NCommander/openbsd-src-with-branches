.Sh NAME
.Nm spif
.Nd SPARC (spiffy) Serial/Parallel Interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "spif* at sbus? slot ? offset ?                " Pq "sun4c/sun4m"
.Cd "stty* at spif?                                " Pq "sun4c/sun4m"
.Cd "sbpp* at spif?                                " Pq "sun4c/sun4m"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm spif
driver provides support for the Sun Serial/Parallel Interface card
(Sun part number 501-1931)
based around the
Cirrus Logic CD180 octal serial controller
and the
Cirrus Logic PPC2 parallel port controller.
.Pp
The device minor numbers for this driver are encoded as follows:

      |   |
      +---+---------------------------> card number
.Ed
.Pp
Up to four cards are supported in the system.
.Pp
Each of the serial ports has an 8 byte FIFO for receive and transmit as
well as automatic hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "spif%d: ccr timeout"
A timeout occured while writing to one of the CD180 registers.
.It "stty%d-%d: fifo overflow"
Incoming characters were discarded because the driver's interrupt
routine could not read them fast enough from the card.
.It "stty%d-%d: ring overflow"
Incoming characters were discarded because the application
in control of the device did not read the input fast enough.

.Sh AUTHORS
The driver was written by Jason Wright <jason@thought.net>, and is
heavily based on the
.Xr magma 4
driver written by Iain Hibbert <plunky@skate.demon.co.uk>.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm spif
driver was first supported in
.Ox 2.5 .
.Sh TODO
The parallel port is not supported yet.
.Pp
Dialout (cua) devices are not yet supported.
