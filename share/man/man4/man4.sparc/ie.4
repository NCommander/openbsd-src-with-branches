.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10 Mb/s Ethernet network via the
.Tn Intel
82586
Ethernet chip set.  The 
.Nm 
is found as an on-board interface on Sun 4/100, and 4/200 workstations.  
The 
.Nm
also exists as a VME card.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
