.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
is an on-board or SBus SCSI controller based on the NCR 53c94 chip, found 
on Sun 4/300, sun4c and sun4m workstations.  
.Sh DEVICE FLAGS
.Bl -tag -width speaker -compact
.It Bits 0-7 disable disconnect/reselect for the corresponding target
.It ""
.It Bits 8-15 disable synchronous negotiation for target "[bit - 8]"
.El
.Pp
The 
.Nm 
device flags may be OR'd together to enable any combination of
the features listed above.  Targets 4 through 7 typically have 
disconnect/reselect enabled on the premise that tape devices normally
have one of these targets.  Tape devices should be allowed to disconnect
for the SCSI bus to operate acceptably.
