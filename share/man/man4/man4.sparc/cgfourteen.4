.Sh NAME
.Nm cgfourteen
.Nd accelerated 8/24-bit color frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "cgfourteen0 at obio0 addr 0x9c000000 flags 0x0000" Pq "SS10SX and SS20"
.Cd "cgfourteen1 at obio0 addr 0x90000000 flags 0x0000" Pq "SS10SX and SS20"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at cgfourteen?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a memory based color frame buffer, with graphics acceleration and
overlay capabilities, for the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
It does not provide direct device driver entry points
but makes its functions available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.
.Pp
By default, the frame buffer will be initialized in 32 bit mode, if the
display resolution allows it.
By setting
.Ar flags
to
.Ar 0x0001
(via
.Xr config 8
or
.Xr boot_config 8 )
it can be force to 8 bit mode, resulting in a faster console.
