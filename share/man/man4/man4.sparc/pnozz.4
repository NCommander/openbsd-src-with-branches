.Sh NAME
.Nm pnozz
.Nd Tadpole Weitek p9100 frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pnozz0 at sbus? slot ? offset ?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at pnozz?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a memory based color frame buffer for the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework, and found on
.Tn "Tadpole SPARCbook 3GS and 3GX"
laptops.
It is based on the
.Tn "Weitek Power 9100"
and an
.Tn "IBM RGB528"
RAMDAC.
It does not provide direct device driver entry points
but makes its functions available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.
.Pp
If the
.Xr tctrl 4
device is also configured, the
.Nm pnozz
will be powered down when the lid of the laptop
is closed or the screen is blanked.
