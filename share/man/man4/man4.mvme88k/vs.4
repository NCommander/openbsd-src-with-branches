.Sh NAME
.Nm vs
.Nd MVME328S High Performance SCSI Controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "vs0 at vmes0 addr 0xffff9000 ipl 2"
.Cd "vs1 at vmes0 addr 0xffff9800 ipl 2"
.Cd "vs2 at vmes0 addr 0xffff4800 ipl 2"

.Cd "scsibus* at vs?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
provides access to the MVME328S family of
.Tn SCSI
.Tn VME
I/O boards.
Depending on the version, it provides a single or dual channel single-ended
.Tn SCSI
interface.
It is attached to the
.Tn VME
bus of the system, controlled by the
.Xr vme 4
.Tn VMEchip2
interface chip.
Several types of both internal and external connectors are provided, also
depending on the version of the MVME328S.
.Sh HARDWARE CONFIGURATION
The card's base address
.Po
matching the
.Em addr
locator on the configuration line
.Pc
is defined through a set of nine jumpers, labeled
.Dq JB1
on the board, near the fuse in a corner of the card.
They are contiguous to the
.Dq JA7
single jumper and
.Dq JA8
dual jumper, located immediately to the left of the
.Dq JB1
block.
.Pp
The only supported configurations are:
.Bl -column "xxxxxxxxx" "0xffffffff"
.It Li JB1 Ta Address Ta Configuration
.It " "
.It Li "___X_XX__" Ta "0xffff9000" Ta "1st board"
.It Li "_____XX__" Ta "0xffff9800" Ta "2nd board"
.It Li "____XX_X_" Ta "0xffff4800" Ta "3rd board"
.It Li "_____X_X_" Ta "0xffff5800" Ta "4th board"
.It Li "___X___X_" Ta "0xffff7000" Ta "5th board"
.It Li "_______X_" Ta "0xffff7800" Ta "6th board"

The daughterboard providing access to the second SCSI channel is not
working under
.Ox
unless the first SCSI channel is not empty.
.Pp
MVME328XT boards are not supported by this driver yet.
