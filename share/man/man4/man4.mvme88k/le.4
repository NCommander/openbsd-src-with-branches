.Sh NAME
.Nm le
.Nd MVME376 Ethernet Communications Controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "le0 at vmes0 addr 0xffff1200 ipl 1 len 0x100"
.Cd "le1 at vmes0 addr 0xffff1400 ipl 1 len 0x100"
.Cd "le2 at vmes0 addr 0xffff1600 ipl 1 len 0x100"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides access to the AMD 7990/LANCE-based MVME376 VME board.
This in turn provides an interface to the
.Tn Ethernet
network.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and
.Tn Ethernet
addresses on the local network.
.Sh HARDWARE CONFIGURATION
The card's base address
.Po
matching the
.Em addr
locator on the configuration line
.Pc
is defined through two sets of DIP switches,
.Dq SW1
and
.Dq SW2 ,
located in the middle of the board, near the space between the two
VME connectors.
.Pp
The only supported configurations are:
.Bl -column "xxxxxxxx" "xxxxxxxx" "0xffffffff"
.It Li SW1 Ta SW2 Ta Address Ta Configuration
.It " "
.It Li "UUU_UU_U" Ta "U__U____" Ta "0xffff1200" Ta "1st board"
.It Li "UUU_U_UU" Ta "U__U_U__" Ta "0xffff1400" Ta "2nd board"
.It Li "UUU_U__U" Ta "U__UU___" Ta "0xffff1600" Ta "3rd board"
.It Li "U_U_U_UU" Ta "U__UUU__" Ta "0xffff5400" Ta "4th board"
.It Li "U_U_U__U" Ta "U_U_____" Ta "0xffff5600" Ta "5th board"
.It Li "_U_UU_UU" Ta "U_U__U__" Ta "0xffffa400" Ta "6th board"

.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver currently does not support the last three board address settings.
