.Sh NAME
.Nm vsbic
.Nd MVME327A SCSI and floppy controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "vsbic0 at vmes0 addr 0xffffa600 ipl 2"
.Cd "vsbic1 at vmes0 addr 0xffffa700 ipl 2"
.Cd "scsibus* at vsbic?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the SCSI interface of the Motorola MVME327A
SCSI and floppy VME controller.
The WD33C93 SCSI controller found on this board is not directly accessible;
instead, the
.Nm
driver runs SCSI commands through the MVME327A firmware interface.

.Sh BUGS
Due to firmware limitations, SCSI commands using command blocks larger than
12 bytes are not supported.
Therefore, only the first 2TB of SCSI disks are accessible.
