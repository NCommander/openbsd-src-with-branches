.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "bktr* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "radio* at bktr?"
.Pp
.Cd "option BKTR_ALLOC_PAGES=nnn"
.Cd "option BKTR_SYSTEM_DEFAULT=XXX"

.Cd "option BKTR_OVERRIDE_TUNER=nnn"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCI video capture and VBI capture on low cost,
high performance boards.
This should support most video cards based on the
Brooktree Bt848/849/878/879 Video Capture Chip.
The driver also supports FM Radio if the Tuner supports it.
.Pp
Specifically, the following cards are known to work:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
Animation Technologies FlyVideo
Askey/Dynalink Magic TView
AverMedia cards
Hauppauge Wincast TV and WinTV/PCI
IMS TV Turbo
Intel Smart Video Recorder III
I/O DATA GV-BCTV2/PCI
KISS TV/FM PCI
Leadtek Winfast TV 2000
Miro PC TV
MMAC Osprey
NEC PK-UG-X017
STB TV PCI Television Tuner
Terratec TerraTVplus
Video Highway XTreme
VideoLogic Captivator PCI
Zoltrix TV
.Ed
.Pp
The driver currently supports the following features:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
PCI to PCI DMA transfer
clipping
yuv
rgb16
rgb24
rgb32
.Ed
.Pp
On these cards, tuners and other components are interconnected with an I2C bus.
The Brooktree848 chips act as a master device on the bus to control them.
.Pp
The following kernel configuration options are available:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxx
.It Cd option BKTR_ALLOC_PAGES=nnn
Specifies the number of contiguous pages to allocate when successfully
probed.
The default number of pages allocated by the kernel is 216.
This means that there are (216*4096) bytes available for use.
.It Cd option BKTR_SYSTEM_DEFAULT="(BROOKTREE_PAL | BROOKTREE_NTSC)"
One of these options can be used to set the default video format for the driver.
This fixed random hangs and lockups with the VideoLogic Captivator PCI card.
.It Cd option BKTR_OVERRIDE_CARD=nnn
Select a specific card (overrides autodetection).
`nnn' is set to one of the names listed and explained below.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 2.2 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver is based on the work of
.An Jim Lowe Aq james@miller.cs.uwm.edu ,
.An Mark Tinguely Aq tinguely@plains.nodak.edu ,
.An Amancio Hasty Aq hasty@star\-gate.com ,
.An Roger Hardiman Aq roger@FreeBSD.org
and a bunch of other people.
.Sh CAVEATS
On big-endian architectures it is not possible to program the
card to perform proper byte swapping in 24 bit modes,
therefore only 16 and 32 bit modes are supported.
