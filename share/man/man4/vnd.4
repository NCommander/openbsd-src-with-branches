.Sh NAME
.Nm vnd
.Nd Vnode Disk Driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device vnd 4"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides a disk-like interface to a file.  This is useful for
a variety of applications, including swap files and building miniroot
or floppy disk images.
.Pp
This document assumes that you're familiar with how to generate kernels,
how to properly configure disks and pseudo-devices in a kernel
configuration file.
.Pp
In order to compile in support for the vnd, you must add a line similar
to the following to your kernel configuration file:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
pseudo-device	vnd	4	# vnode disk driver
.Ed
.Pp
The count argument is how many
.Nm vnds
memory is allocated for a boot time.  In this example, no more than 4
.Nm vnds
may be configured.
.Pp
There is a run-time utility that is used for configuring
.Nm vnds .
See
.Xr vnconfig 8
for more information.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver does not work if the file does not reside in a local filesystem.
The
.Nm
driver does not support disklabels at the moment.
.Sh FILES
/dev/{,r}vnd* - vnd device special files.
.Pp
.Sh HISTORY
The vnode disk driver was originally written at the University of
Utah.
