.Sh NAME
.Nm uscanner
.Nd USB scanner support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "uscanner* at uhub?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides minimal support for USB scanners.
The driver recognizes a number of USB scanners, but to
actually scan anything there needs to be software that knows
about the particular scanner.
The SANE package provides support for some scanners.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver works with the following scanners:
.Ss Epson
.Bl -tag -width Microtek -offset indent -compact
.It GT-7000
.It Perfection 610U
.It Perfection 636U
.It Perfection 1200U
.It Perfection 1200U Photo
.El
.Ss HP
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It ScanJet 4100C
.It ScanJet 5200C
.It ScanJet 5300C
.It ScanJet 6300C
.El
.Ss Microtek
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It ScanMaker X6USB
.El
.Pp
Many other scanners are recognized, but there is no software support
for them yet.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .
.Ox
support was first added in
.Ox 2.9 .
.Sh BUGS
This driver should not really exist.
The scanners it recognizes can be accessed through the
.Xr ugen 4
driver instead.
A proper scanner driver would provide a uniform interface to scanners
instead of exposing the innards of the scanner.
The reason the driver exists is to have something that is compatible
with the Linux driver.
