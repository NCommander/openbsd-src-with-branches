.Dt USCANNER 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm uscanner
.Nd USB scanner support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "uscanner* at uhub?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides minimal support for USB scanners.
The driver recognizes a number of USB scanners, but to
actually scan anything there needs to be software that knows
about the particular scanner.
The SANE package provides support for some scanners.
.Pp
For multifunction USB devices
such as scanner/printer/card readers,
this driver only attaches to the USB interface that controls the scanner.
For the other USB interfaces
separate drivers are needed,
such as
.Xr ulpt 4
and
.Xr umass 4 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver works with the following scanners:

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .
.Ox
support was first added in
.Ox 2.9 .
.Sh BUGS
This driver should not really exist.
The scanners it recognizes can be accessed through the
.Xr ugen 4
driver instead.
A proper scanner driver would provide a uniform interface to scanners
instead of exposing the innards of the scanner.
The reason the driver exists is to have something that is compatible
with the Linux driver.
