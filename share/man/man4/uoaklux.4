.Nd Toradex OAK USB illuminance sensor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "uoaklux* at uhidev?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Toradex OAK LUX.
The sensor possesses a collection of sensor values which are
made available through the
.Xr sysctl 8
interface.
.Pp
The illuminance date unit is "Lux".
Because the sensing cycle of the illuminance sensor is faster than
the sensor framework update period,
the driver keeps maximum/minimum/average values as independent sensors.
.Pp
The device has a unique serial number,
indicated in the description part of the sensor value.
