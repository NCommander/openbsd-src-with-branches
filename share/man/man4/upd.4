.Sh NAME
.Nm upd
.Nd USB Power Devices battery voltage and load sensor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "upd* at uhub?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver exposes data from USB Power Devices (such as an UPS),
as hardware sensors via
.Xr sysctl 3 .
The following devices are supported by the
.Nm
driver:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
American Power Conversion Smart-UPS 750
.It
American Power Conversion Back-UPS CS 350
.El
.Pp
The following sensors are provided by the
.Nm
driver, which can be monitored using
.Xr sensorsd 8 :
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
RelativeStateOfCharge
.It
AbsoluteStateOfCharge
.It
RemainingCapacity
.It
FullChargeCapacity
.It

.It
Discharging
.It
BatteryPresent
.It
ShutdownImminent
.It
ACPresent
.It
AtRateTimeToFull
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
In this example, the upd0 device is a regular UPS.
We use an entry on
.Xr sensorsd 8
to take an action when the battery level is below a 70%:
.Bd -literal
hw.sensors.upd0.percent0:low=70:command=/etc/sensorsd/lowbattwarn %l
.Ed
.Pp
The contents of lowbattwarn could be:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#!/bin/ksh

if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
        return;
fi

if [ $1 -lt 70 ]; then
        logger "ups battery warning-level, halting"
        /sbin/halt -p
fi

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 5.6 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Andre de Oliveira Aq Mt andre@openbsd.org ,
partially sponsored by Esdenera Networks GmbH.
.Sh CAVEATS
When the battery is not present, even with Battery Presence indicator set to
Off the remaining battery sensors will still be present, besides their values
cannot be trusted.
.Pp
Users of apcupsd port will notice either
.Xr ugen 4 ,
is missing, it is necessary to disable the
.Nm
driver
in order to use apcupsd.
