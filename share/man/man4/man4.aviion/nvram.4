.Sh NAME
.Nm nvram
.Nd Mostek MK48T0x battery-backed realtime clock
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "nvram0  at syscon0 offset 0x80000"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
Mostek MK48T02 realtime clock chip.
.Pp
In addition to the clock itself, this chip embeds 2KB
of battery-backed memory, which is accessible through the special
.Pa /dev/nvram0
file.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa -compact

.Sh CAVEATS
The last 8 bytes of the battery-backed memory contains the realtime clock
registers.
Writing to these locations will interfere with proper clock operation.
.Pp
Most, if not all, of the battery-backed memory is used by DG/UX to store
some of its configuration data, and may be reinitialized by the PROM
if it considers the memory contents as invalid.
The
.Nm
driver does not prevent access to this reserved part.
