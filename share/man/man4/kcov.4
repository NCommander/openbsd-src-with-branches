.Dt KCOV 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm kcov
.Nd kernel code coverage tracing
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd option KCOV
.Pp
.In sys/kcov.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver implements collection of code coverage inside the kernel.
It can be enabled on a per process basis from userland,
allowing the kernel program counter to be collected during syscalls triggered by
the same process.
The collected coverage can be accessed by mapping the device
using
.Xr mmap 2 .
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
is not enabled but requires the compile-time configuration
.Cd option KCOV
to be present;
see
.Xr options 4 .
.Pp
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls are provided:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Dv KIOSETBUFSIZE Fa unsigned long *nentries
Allocate a coverage buffer with a capacity of
.Fa nentries .
The buffer can be accessed using
.Xr mmap 2 ,
whereas the returned pointer must be interpreted as an array of
.Vt unsigned long
entries.
The first entry contains the number of entries in the array,
excluding the first entry.
.It Dv KIOENABLE Fa void
Enable code coverage tracing for the current process.
.It Dv KIODISABLE Fa void
Disable code coverage tracing for the current process.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/kcov -compact
.It Pa /dev/kcov
Default device node.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
In the following example,
the
.Xr read 2
syscall is traced and the coverage displayed, which in turn can be passed to
.Xr addr2line 1
in order to translate the kernel program counter into the file name and line
number it corresponds to.
