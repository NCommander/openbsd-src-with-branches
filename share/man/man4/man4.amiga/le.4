.Sh NAME
.Nm le
.Nd Ethernet driver for AMD7990(LANCE)-based boards 
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "le* at zbus0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10 Mb/s Ethernet network via the
.Tn AMD
7990
.Tn LANCE
Ethernet chip set.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
interface supports the following Zorro II expansion cards:
.Bl -tag -width "AMERISTAR" -offset indent
.It Em A2065
Commodore's ethernet card, manufacturer\ 514, product\ 112
.It Em AMERISTAR
Ameristar's ethernet card, manufacturer\ 1053, product\ 1
.El
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Tn Amiga
.Nm
interface first appeared in
.Nx 0.9a
