.Dt BAH 4 amiga
.Sh NAME
.Nm bah
.Nd ARCnet driver for SMC COM90C26 based boards
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "bah* at zbus0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
interface provides access to the 2.5 Mb/s ARCnet network via the
.Tn SMC
COM90C26
ARCnet chip set.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl .
The
.Nm
interface does not employ the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network. Instead, it uses the least significant 8 bits of the IP address
as hardware address, as described in
.Xr RFC 1051
and
.Xr RFC 1201
as one option.
.Pp
With the IFF_LINK0 flag cleared, IP encoding is done according to the
deprecated, but popular among Amiga users, RFC 1051 encoding (that
is, with simple header, packet type 240), and the MTU is 507.
.Pp 
With the IFF_LINK0 flag set, IP encoding is done according to RFC 1201 (that 
is, with Packet Header Definition Standard header and packet type 212). The MTU
is normally 1500.
.Pp
When switching between the two modes, do a 
.Cd ifconfig interfacename down up
to switch the mtu.
.Pp
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
interface supports the following Zorro II expansion cards:
.Bl -tag -width "AMERISTAR" -offset indent
.It Em A2060
Commodore's arcnet card, manufacturer\ 514, product\ 9
.It Em AMERISTAR
Ameristar's arcnet card, manufacturer\ 1053, product\ 9

.Sh STANDARDS
RFC 1051 / RFC1201 without ARP, using direct mapping of lower 8 IP
address bits instead.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Tn Amiga
.Nm
interface first appeared in
