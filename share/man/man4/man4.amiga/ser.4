serial communications interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ser0 at mainbus0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn Amiga 8520
controls, among other things, a single port
.Tn EIA
.Tn RS-232C
.Pf ( Tn CCITT
.Tn V.28 )
communications interface with a single character buffer.
Such an interface is built-in to all Amiga machines.
.Pp
Input and output for each line may set to one of following baud rates;
50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600,
