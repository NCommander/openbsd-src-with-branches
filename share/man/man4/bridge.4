.Dt BRIDGE 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm bridge
.Nd Ethernet bridge interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd pseudo-device bridge 2
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm bridge
device allows an Ethernet bridge to be created between two or more interfaces.
The bridges provided by this interface are learning bridges with the ability
to do IP filtering, see
.Xr ipf 4 , Ns
before packets are forwarded by the bridge.
.Sh IOCTLS
A
.Nm bridge
interface responds to all of the
.Xr ioctl 2
calls specific to other interfaces listed in
.Xr netintro 4 .
The following 
.Xr ioctl 2
calls are specific to
.Nm bridge
devices.
They are defined in
.Aq Pa sys/sockio.h .
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width SIOCBRDGIDX
.It Dv SIOCBRDGIFS
.Pq Li "struct ifbifconf"
Retrieve member interface list from a bridge.  This request takes an
.Ar ifbifconf
structure (see below) as a value-result parameter.
The
.Ar ifbic_len
field should be initially set to the size of the buffer
pointed to by
.Ar ifbic_buf .
On return it will contain the length, in bytes, of the configuration
list.
Alternatively, if the
.Ar ifbic_len
passed in is set to 0,
SIOCBRDGIFS will set
.Ar ifbic_len
to the size that
.Ar ifbic_buf
needs to be to fit the entire configuration list,
and will not fill in the other parameters.
This is useful for determining the exact size that
.Ar ifbic_buf
needs to be in advance.
.Pp
The argument structure is defined as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct ifbreq {
	char ifbr_name[IFNAMSIZ];    /* bridge name */
	char ifbr_ifsname[IFNAMSIZ]; /* member name */
	u_int32_t ifbr_ifsflags;     /* member flags */
};

struct ifbifconf {
	char ifbic_name[IFNAMSIZ]; /* bridge name */
	u_int32_t       ifbic_len; /* buffer size */
	union {
		caddr_t ifbicu_buf; /* buffer */
		struct  ifbreq *ifbicu_req;
	} ifbic_ifbicu;
#define ifbic_buf       ifbic_ifbicu.ifbicu_buf
#define ifbic_req       ifbic_ifbicu.ifbicu_req
};
.Ed
.It Dv SIOCBRDGADD
.Pq Li "struct ifbreq"
Add the interface named in
.Ar ifbr_ifsname
to the bridge named in
.Ar ifbr_name .
.It Dv SIOCBRDGDEL
.Pq Li "struct ifbreq"
Delete the interface named in
.Ar ifbr_ifsname
from the bridge named in
.Ar ifbr_name .
.It Dv SIOCBRDGRTS
.Pq Li "struct ifbaconf"
Retrieve the address cache of the bridge named in
.Ar ifbac_name .
This request takes an
.Ar ifbaconf
structure (see below) as a value result parameter.
The
.Ar ifbac_len
field should be initially set to the size of the buffer pointed to by
.Ar ifbac_buf .
On return, it will contain the length, in bytes, of the configuration list.
Alternatively, if the
.Ar ifbac_len
passed in is set to 0, SIOCBRDGRTS will set it to the size that
.Ar ifbac_buf
needs to be to fit the entire configuration list and not fill in the other
parameters.
As with SIOCBRDGIFS, this is useful for determining the exact size that
.Ar ifbac_buf
needs to be in advance.
.Pp
The argument structure is defined as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct ifbareq {
	char ifba_name[IFNAMSIZ];    /* bridge name */
	char ifba_ifsname[IFNAMSIZ]; /* dest ifs */
	u_int8_t ifba_age;           /* addr age */
	u_int8_t ifba_flags;         /* addr age */
	struct ether_addr ifba_dst;  /* dest addr */
};

#define IFBAF_TYPEMASK 0x03  /* address type mask */
#define IFBAF_DYNAMIC  0x00  /* dynamically learned */
#define IFBAF_STATIC   0x01  /* static address */

struct ifbaconf {
	char ifbac_name[IFNAMSIZ]; /* bridge name */
	u_int32_t ifbac_len;       /* buffer size */
	union {
		caddr_t ifbacu_buf;     /* buffer */
		struct ifbareq *ifbacu_req;
	} ifbac_ifbacu;
#define	ifbac_buf       ifbac_ifbacu.ifbacu_buf
#define	ifbac_req       ifbac_ifbacu.ifbacu_req
};
.Ed
.It Dv SIOCBRDGSADDR
.Pq Li "struct ifbareq"
Add an entry, manually, to the address cache for the bridge named in
.Ar ifba_name .
The address and its associated interface and flags are set in the
.Ar ifba_dst ,
.Ar ifba_ifsname ,
.Ar ifba_flags
fields, respectively.
.It Dv SIOCBRDGDADDR
.Pq Li "struct ifbareq"
Delete an entry from the address cache of the bridge named in
.Ar ifba_name .
Entries are deleted strictly based on the address field
.Ar ifba_dst .
.It Dv SIOCBRDGSCACHE
.Pq Li "struct ifbcachereq"
Set the maximum address cache size for the bridge named in
.Ar ifbc_name
to
.Ar ifbc_size
entries.
.Pp
The argument structure is as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct ifbcachereq {
	char ifbc_name[IFNAMSIZ]; /* bridge */
	u_int32_t ifbc_size;      /* size */
};
.Ed
.It Dv SIOCBRDGGCACHE
.Pq Li "struct ifbcachereq"
Retrieve the maximum size of the address cache for the bridge
.Ar ifbc_name .
.It Dv SIOCBRDGSTO
.Pq Li "struct ifbcachetoreq"
Set the time, in seconds, that addresses which have not been
seen on the network (transmitted a packet) remain in the cache.
If the time is set to zero, no aging is performed on the address
cache.  The argument structure is as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct ifbcachetoreq {
	char ifbct_name[IFNAMSIZ]; /* bridge */
	u_int32_t ifbct_time;      /* time */
};
.Ed
.It Dv SIOCBRDGGTO
.Pq Li "struct ifbcachetoreq"
Retrieve the address cache expiration time (see above).
.El
.Sh ERRORS
If the
.Xr ioctl 2
call fails,
.Xr errno 2
is set to one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Eq ENOENT
For an add request, this means that the named interface is not configured
into the system.
For delete operation, it means that the named interface is not a member
of the bridge.
.It Bq Eq ENOMEM
Memory could not be allocated for an interface or cache entry
to be added to the bridge.
.It Bq Eq EEXIST
The named interface is already a member of the bridge.
.It Bq Eq EBUSY
The named interface is already a member of another bridge.
.It Bq Eq EINVAL
The named interface is not an Ethernet interface.
.It Bq Eq ENETDOWN
The named interface is not ready for receiving packets.
.It Bq Eq EPERM
Super-user privilege is required to add and delete interfaces to and from
bridges and to set the bridge interface flags.
.It Bq Eq EFAULT
The buffer used in a SIOCBRDGIFS or SIOCBRDGRTS request points outside
of the process's allocated address space.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Xr brconfig 8
command and the
.Xr bridge 4
kernel interface first appeared in
.Ox 2.5 .
.Sh AUTHOR
The
.Xr brconfig 8
command and the
.Xr bridge 4
kernel interface were written by Jason L. Wright <jason@thought.net> as
part of an undergraduate indenpendent study
at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.
.Sh BUGS
There is currently no loop detection.  Care must be taken to make sure
that loops are not created when a bridge is brought up.
