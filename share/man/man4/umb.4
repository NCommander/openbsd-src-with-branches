.Sh NAME
.Nm umb
.Nd USB Mobile Broadband Interface Model (MBIM)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "umb*  at uhub?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB MBIM devices.
Those devices establish connections via celluar networks such as
GPRS, UMTS, and LTE.
.Pp
The
.Nm
device appears as a regular point-to-point network interface,
transporting raw IP frames.
.Pp
Required configuration parameters like PIN and APN have to be set
via
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
Once the SIM card has been unlocked with the correct PIN, it
will remain in this state until the device is power-cycled.
In case the device is connected to an "always-on" USB port,
it is possible to connect to a provider without entering the
PIN again even afer a reboot of the system.
.Pp
If a default gateway route is configured for the
.Nm
network interface, the driver will modify the destination IP address
dynamically, according to the information sent by the network provider.
.Sh HARDWARE
The following devices are known to be supported by the
.Nm
driver:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Tn Sierra Wireless EM8805
.It Tn Sierra Wireless MC8305
.El
.Pp
There are probably a lot more devices that also work flawlessly.
If some devices fail to provide a confirming MBIM implementation,
their vendor and product IDs should be added to the driver's blacklist
manually.
Since most devices offer multiple interfaces, blacklisted ones will
probably be attached by some other driver, such as
.Xr umsm 4 .

The
.Nm
driver currently does not support IPv6 addresses.
