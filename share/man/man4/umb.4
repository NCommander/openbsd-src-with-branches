.Sh NAME
.Nm umb
.Nd USB Mobile Broadband Interface Model (MBIM)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "umb*  at uhub?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB MBIM devices.
.Pp
MBIM devices establish connections via cellular networks such as
GPRS, UMTS, and LTE.
They appear as a regular point-to-point network interface,
transporting raw IP frames.
.Pp
Required configuration parameters like PIN and APN have to be set
with
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
Once the SIM card has been unlocked with the correct PIN, it
will remain in this state until the MBIM device is power-cycled.
In case the device is connected to an "always-on" USB port,
it may be possible to connect to a provider without entering the
PIN again even if the system was rebooted.
.Sh HARDWARE
The following devices should work:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Dell DW5821e
.It Ericsson H5321gw and N5321gw
.It Fibocom L831-EAU
.\" .It Huawei ME906s -- attaches but needs more work
.It Medion Mobile S4222 (MediaTek OEM)
.It Sierra Wireless EM7345

.Sh CAVEATS
Devices which fail to provide a conforming MBIM implementation will
probably be attached as some other driver, such as
.Xr umsm 4 .
