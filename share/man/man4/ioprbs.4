.Sh NAME
.Nm ioprbs
.Nd I2O random block storage
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ioprbs* at iop? tid ?"
.Cd "scsibus* at ioprbs?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for I2O random block storages, like RAID-sets.
So far only the following adapters has been tested:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width -offset indent -compact
.Tn Adaptec 2100S ,
.Tn Adaptec 3200S .
.El
.Pp
Although only those two adapters have been tested, the I2O interface is
a generic one, and the driver should cope with all I2O random block
storages with no further adaptions.
.Pp
The storage is presented to the system as SCSI disks for uniformity
with other RAID controllers we support.  All RAID configuration is done
through the controllers' BIOSes.
