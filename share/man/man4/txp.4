.Sh NAME
.Nm txp
.Nd 3Com 3XP Typhoon/Sidewinder (3CR990) 10/100 Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "txp* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10Mb/s and 100Mb/s Ethernet networks via the
.Tn 3Com
.Tn Typhoon/Sidewinder
chipset.
This driver supports the following cards:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
3Com 3CR990-TX-95
.It
3Com 3CR990-TX-97
.It
3Com 3CR990SVR95
.It
3Com 3CR990SVR97
.El
.Pp
Basic Ethernet functions are provided as well as support for
VLAN tag insertion, receive
.Xr ip 4 ,
.Xr tcp 4 ,
and
.Xr udp 4
checksum offloading,
and
transmit
.Xr ip 4
checksum offloading.
There is currently no support for
transmit
.Xr tcp 4
or
.Xr udp 4
checksum offloading,
.Xr tcp 4
segmentation, nor
.Xr ipsec 4
acceleration.
Note that hardware checksumming is only used when the interface is not
in
.Xr bridge 4
mode.
.Pp
When a
.Nm
interface is brought up, by default, it will attempt to auto-negotiate the
link speed and duplex mode.
The speeds, in order of attempt, are: 100Mb/s Full Duplex, 100Mb/s Half Duplex,
10 Mb/s Full Duplex, and 10 Mb/s Half Duplex.
.Pp
The
.Nm
supports several media types, which are selected via the
.Xr ifconfig 8
command.
The supported media types are:
.Bl -tag -width 6n -offset indent
.It media autoselect
Attempt to autoselect the media type (default)
.It media 100baseTX mediaopt full-duplex
Use 100baseTX, full duplex
.It media 100baseTX Op mediaopt half-duplex
Use 100baseTX, half duplex
.It media 10baseT mediaopt full-duplex
Use 10baseT, full duplex
.It media 10baseT Op mediaopt half-duplex
Use 10baseT, half duplex
.El
.Sh FILES
The driver needs a firmware file,
which is loaded on demand when the device is attached:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Pa /etc/firmware/3c990
