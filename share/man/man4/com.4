.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm com
and
.Nm pccom
drivers provide support for NS8250-, NS16450-, NS16550-, ST16650-, and
TI16750-based
.Tn EIA
.Tn RS-232C
.Pf ( Tn CCITT
.Tn V.28 )
communications interfaces.
The
.Nm pccom
driver (i386-only) also supports the XR16850 UART.
.Pp
The NS8250 and NS16450 have single
character buffers, the NS16550 has a 16 character buffer, while
the ST16650 has a 32 character buffer, and the TI16750 has a 64 character
buffer.
The XR16850 has a 128 character buffer.
.Pp
The
.Nm com
and
.Nm pccom
drivers are mutually exclusive; both may not be present in the same system at
the same time.
Attempting to compile such a system will fail.
.Pp
Input and output for each line may be set to one of following baud rates;
50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600,
19200, 38400, 57600, or 115200, or any other baud rate which is a factor
of 115200.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was originally derived from the
.Nm HP9000/300
.Nm dca
driver.
.Sh BUGS
Data loss is possible on busy systems with unbuffered UARTs at high speed.
.Pp
The name of this driver and the constants which define the locations
of the various serial ports are holdovers from
.Nm DOS .
