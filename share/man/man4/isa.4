.Nd introduction to ISA bus support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "# amd64 and i386"
.Cd "isa0 at mainbus0"
.Cd "isa0 at pcib?"

.Pp
Attachments are machine-dependent and depend on the bus topology and
.Tn ISA
bus interface of your system.
See
.Xr intro 4
for your system for details.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The system includes a machine-independent
.Tn ISA
bus subsystem and several machine-independent
.Tn ISA
device drivers.
.Pp
Your system may support additional
.Tn ISA
devices.
Drivers for
.Tn ISA
devices not listed here are machine-dependent.
Consult your system's
.Xr intro 4
for additional information.
.Pp
Note that interrupt mappings on the i386 may require that you configure
your BIOS to reserve the interrupts for these devices as "Legacy ISA".
If such configuration is not done, the system may use those interrupts
for
.Xr pci 4
or
.Xr isapnp 4
devices instead.
.Sh SUPPORTED DEVICES
