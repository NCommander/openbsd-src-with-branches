.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver
appeared in
.Nx 1.3 .
.Sh CAVEATS
From time to time an
.Nm
device will be found which the kernel does not recognize.
The kernel matches
.Nm
devices to device drivers based on identifiers which each device
provides.
For example, this device:
.Pp
joy0 at isapnp0 <Creative SB16 PnP, CTL7001, PNPB02F, Game> port 0x200/8
.Pp
This joystick calls itself by the two names
.Dq CTL7001
and
.Dq PNPB02F .
The latter is a standard name (which the kernel automatically recognizes),
but
.Dq CTL7001
is a vendor-specific name which needs to be added to a table.
Unfortunately,
some devices advertise only their vendor-specific name; for instance:
.Pp
isapnp0: <PnP Sound Chip, @P@1001, , > port 0x200/8 not configured
.Pp
Testing will show that this device is actually a joystick.
To resolve the issue, the actual name
.Dq @P@1001
has to be entered into the database found in
.Pa /sys/dev/isa/pnpdevs
and a new kernel must be built.
Then the device will probe like this:
.Pp
joy0 at isapnp0 <PnP Sound Chip, @P@1001, , > port 0x200/8
