.Sh NAME
.Nm isapnp
.Nd introduction to ISA Plug-and-Play support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "isapnp0 at isa?"
.Pp
An
.Nm
bus can be configured for each supported ISA bus.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ox
provides machine-independent bus support and drivers for ISA
Plug-and-Play (isapnp) autoconfiguration of PnP-compatible
devices on an ISA bus.
.Sh SUPPORTED DEVICES
.Ox
includes machine-independent ISAPNP drivers, sorted by function
and driver name:
.Pp
.Ss SCSI controllers
.Bl -tag -width speaker -offset indent -compact
.It aic
Adaptec AHA-1520B SCSI controller card.
.It aha
Adaptec AHA-154x SCSI controller card.
.El
.Pp
.Ss Serial and parallel interfaces
.Bl -tag -width speaker -offset indent -compact
.It com & pccom
8250/16450/16550/16650/16850-compatible ISA PnP serial cards and internal
modems (i386 only).
.El

.It ep
3Com 3c509B Etherlink-III Ethernet interface.
.It le

Joystick driver.
.El
.Sh CAVEATS
From time to time an
.Nm
device will be found which the kernel does not recognize.
The kernel matches
.Nm
devices to device drivers based on identifiers which each device
provides.  For example, this device:
.Pp
joy0 at isapnp0 <Creative SB16 PnP, CTL7001, PNPB02F, Game> port 0x200/8
.Pp
This joystick calls itself by the two names
.Dq CTL7001
and
.Dq PNPB02F .
The latter is a standard name -- which the kernel automaticaly recognises,
but
.Dq CTL7001
is a vendor-specific name which needs to be added to a table.  Some devices
unfortunately advertise only using vendor-specific names, for instance:
.Pp
isapnp0: <PnP Sound Chip, @P@1001, , > port 0x200/8 not configured
.Pp
Testing will show that this device is actually a joystick.  To resolve
the issue, the actual name
.Dq @P@1001
has to be entered into the database found in
.Pa /sys/dev/isa/pnpdevs
and a new kernel must be built.
Then the device will probe like this:
.Pp
joy0 at isapnp0 <PnP Sound Chip, @P@1001, , > port 0x200/8
