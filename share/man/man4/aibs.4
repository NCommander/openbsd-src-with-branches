.Sh NAME
.Nm aibs
.Nd ASUSTeK AI Booster ACPI ATK0110 voltage, temperature and fan sensor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "aibs* at acpi?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the voltage, temperature and fan sensors
available through
ATK0110
ACPI
device
on ASUSTeK motherboards.
The number of sensors of each type,
as well as the description of each sensor,
varies with motherboards.
.Pp
The driver supports an arbitrary set of sensors,
provides description regarding what each sensor is used for,
and reports whether each sensor is within the specifications
as defined by the motherboard manufacturer through ACPI.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports sensor states as follows.
Temperature sensors can have a state of
.Dv OK ,
.Dv WARN ,
.Dv CRIT
or
.Dv UNKNOWN ;
whereas fan and voltage sensors can have a state of
.Dv OK
or
.Dv WARN
only.
Temperature sensors that have a reading of 0
are marked as invalid and their state is set to
.Dv UNKNOWN ,
whereas all other sensors are always assumed valid.
Temperature sensors have two upper limits
.Dv ( WARN
and
.Dv CRIT )
, fan sensors have either only the lower limit, or
one lower and one upper limit,
and voltage sensors always have a lower and an upper limit.
.Pp
Sensor values are made available through the
.Dv HW_SENSORS
.Xr sysctl 3
interface,
and can be monitored with
.Xr systat 1 
.Ar sensors
view,
.Xr sensorsd 8
and
.Xr sysctl 8
.Ar hw.sensors .
For example, on Asus Stricker Extreme motherboard:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ sysctl hw.sensors.aibs0
hw.sensors.aibs0.temp0=31.00 degC (CPU Temperature), OK
hw.sensors.aibs0.temp1=43.00 degC (MB Temperature), OK
hw.sensors.aibs0.fan0=2490 RPM (CPU FAN Speed), OK
hw.sensors.aibs0.fan1=0 RPM (CHASSIS FAN Speed), WARNING
hw.sensors.aibs0.fan2=0 RPM (OPT1 FAN Speed), WARNING
hw.sensors.aibs0.fan3=0 RPM (OPT2 FAN Speed), WARNING

hw.sensors.aibs0.fan5=0 RPM (OPT4 FAN Speed), WARNING
hw.sensors.aibs0.fan6=0 RPM (OPT5 FAN Speed), WARNING
hw.sensors.aibs0.fan7=0 RPM (PWR FAN Speed), WARNING
hw.sensors.aibs0.volt0=1.26 VDC (Vcore Voltage), OK
hw.sensors.aibs0.volt1=3.25 VDC ( +3.3 Voltage), OK
hw.sensors.aibs0.volt2=4.95 VDC ( +5.0 Voltage), OK
hw.sensors.aibs0.volt3=11.78 VDC (+12.0 Voltage), OK
hw.sensors.aibs0.volt4=1.23 VDC (1.2VHT Voltage), OK
hw.sensors.aibs0.volt5=1.50 VDC (SB CORE Voltage), OK
hw.sensors.aibs0.volt6=1.25 VDC (CPU VTT Voltage), OK
hw.sensors.aibs0.volt7=0.93 VDC (DDR2 TERM Voltage), OK
hw.sensors.aibs0.volt8=1.23 VDC (NB CORE Voltage), OK
hw.sensors.aibs0.volt9=1.87 VDC (MEMORY Voltage), OK
