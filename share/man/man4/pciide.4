.Sh NAME
.Nm pciide
.Nd PCI IDE controller driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pciide* at pci ? dev ? function ? flags 0x0000"
.Cd "options PCIIDE_CMD064x_DISABLE"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the PCI IDE controllers as specified in the
"PCI IDE controller specification, revision 1.0" draft, and provides the core
functions for the
.Xr wd 4
and
.Xr atapi 4
drivers. This driver includes specific, enhanced support for the CMD Tech
PCI0640 controller and IDE DMA/UltraDMA support for the following
controllers:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact -offset indent
.It
Acer Labs M5229 IDE controller
.It
CMD Tech PCI0643 and PCI0646 IDE controllers
.It
Contaq Microsystems/Cypress CY82C693 IDE controller
.It
Intel PIIX, PIIX3, and PIIX4 IDE controllers
.It
Silicon Integrated System 5597/5598 IDE controller
.It
VIA Technologies VT82C586 and VT82C586A IDE controllers
.El 
.Pp
Some of these contollers are only available in multifunction PCI chips.
.Pp
The 0x0001 flag forces the
.Nm 
driver to use DMA when there is no explicit DMA mode setting support for
the controller but DMA is present. If the BIOS didn't configure the controller
properly, this can cause a machine hang.

.Sh BUGS
There's no way to reliably know if a PCI064x controller is enabled or not.
If the driver finds a PCI064x, it will assume it is enabled unless
.Dv PCIIDE_CMD064x_DISABLE
is specified in the kernel config file.
This will be a problem only if the controller has been disabled in the BIOS
and another controller has been installed which uses the ISA legacy I/O ports
and interrupts.
.Pp
The timings used for the PIO and DMA modes for controllers listed above
are for a PCI bus running at 30 or 33 Mhz. This driver may not
work properly on overclocked systems.
