.Sh NAME
.Nm sequencer
.Nd OSS-compatible MIDI sequencer device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device sequencer" Op Ar count
.Pp
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/midiio.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device provides an event-oriented interface simultaneously
to all MIDI ports.
Events sent to or received from this device not only contain the
actual MIDI events, but also timing information.
The kernel will make sure that data is sent to the physical
device at the indicated time.
The
.Nm
device uses the
.Xr midi 4
devices internally and they are unavailable when used by the
.Nm
device.
.Pp
The API for the
.Nm
device is binary compatible with the OSS sequencer
interface.
