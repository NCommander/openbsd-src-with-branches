.Sh NAME
.Nm pflow
.Nd kernel interface for pflow data export
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device pflow"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface is a pseudo-device which exports
.Nm
accounting data from the kernel using
.Xr udp 4
packets.
.Nm
is compatible with netflow v5.
The data is extracted from the
.Xr pf 4
state table.
.Pp
Multiple
.Nm
interfaces can be created at runtime using the
.Ic ifconfig pflow Ns Ar N Ic create
command.
Each interface must be configured with a flow receiver IP address and
port number.
.Pp
Only states created by a rule marked with the
.Ar pflow
keyword are exported by the
.Nm
interface.
.Pp
The
.Nm
interface will attempt to export multiple
.Nm
records in one
UDP packet, but will not hold a record for longer than 30 seconds.
The packet size and thus the maximum number of flows is controlled by the
.Cm mtu
parameter of
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
Each packet seen on this interface has one header and a variable number of
flows.
The header indicates the version of the protocol, number of
flows in the packet, a unique sequence number, system time, and an engine
ID and type.
Header and flow structs are defined in
.Aq Pa net/if_pflow.h .
.Pp
There is a one-to-one correspondence between packets seen by
.Xr bpf 4
on the
.Nm
interface and packets sent out to the flow receiver.
That is, a packet with 30 flows on
.Nm
means that the same 30 flows were sent out to the receiver.
.Pp
The
.Nm
source and destination addresses are controlled by
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Cm flowsrc
is the sender IP address of the UDP packet which can be used
to identify the source of the data on the
.Nm
collector.
.Cm flowdst
defines the collector IP address and the port.
The
.Cm flowdst
IP address and port must be defined to enable the export of flows.
.Pp
For example, the following command sets 10.0.0.1 as the source
and 10.0.0.2:1234 as destination:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig pflow0 flowsrc 10.0.0.1 flowdst 10.0.0.2:1234

device first appeared in
