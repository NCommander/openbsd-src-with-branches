.Dt SBUS 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sbus
.Nd introduction to machine-independent sbus bus support and drivers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sbus* at mainbus?"
.Cd "sbus* at iommu?"
.Cd "sbus* at xbox?"
.Pp
These
.Nm
attachments are specific to the sparc and sparc64 ports.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an I/O interconnect bus mostly found in
.Tn SPARC
workstations and small to medium server class systems.
It supports both on-board peripherals and extension boards.
The
.Nm
specifications define the bus protocol as well as the electrical and
mechanical properties of the extension slots.
.Sh HARDWARE
