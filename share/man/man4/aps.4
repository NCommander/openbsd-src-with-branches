.Sh NAME
.Nm aps
.Nd ThinkPad Active Protection System accelerometer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "aps0 at isa? port 0x1600"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for several sensors found in some ThinkPad laptops.
.Pp
The sensors currently exposed via the
.Xr sysctl 8
interface are:
.Bl -column "Sensor" "Units" "Typical" -offset indent
.It Sy "Sensor" Ta Sy "Units" Ta Sy "Typical Use"
.It Li "X_ACCEL" Ta "Unknown" Ta "X Acceleration"
.It Li "Y_ACCEL" Ta "Unknown" Ta "Y Acceleration"
.It Li "X_VAR" Ta "Unknown" Ta "Weighted X Acceleration?"
.It Li "Y_VAR" Ta "Unknown" Ta "Weighted Y Acceleration?"
.It Li "Temp1" Ta "uK" Ta "Unknown"
.It Li "Temp2" Ta "uK" Ta "Unknown"
.It Li "KBD_ACT" Ta "boolean" Ta "Keyboard activity"
.It Li "MS_ACT" Ta "boolean" Ta "Mouse activity"
.It Li "LID_OPEN" Ta "boolean" Ta "Lid state"
.It Li "unknown" Ta "Unknown" Ta "Unknown"

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sensorsd 8 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 3.8 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Jonathan Gray Aq jsg@openbsd.org .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
driver does not yet maintain state and take evasive action when it
thinks the hard disk is in danger.
.Pp
The Y axis on X40 and possibly other models seems to be inverted,
it is unknown how to distinguish between different versions of the
accelerometer to compensate for this in the driver at this time.
.Pp
As IBM provides no documentation, it is not known what all the available
sensors are used for.
