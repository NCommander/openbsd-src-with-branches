.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to the
.Tn SCSI
bus(es) connected to Adaptec
.Tn AIC7770,
.Tn AIC7850,
.Tn AIC7860,
.Tn AIC7870,
.Tn AIC7880,
.Tn AIC7890,
.Tn AIC7891,
.Tn AIC7895,
.Tn AIC7896,
.Tn AIC7892,
.Tn AIC7897,
or
.Tn AIC7899
host adapter chips.
These chips are found on many motherboards as well as the following
Adaptec SCSI controller cards:
.Tn 274X(W),
.Tn 274X(T),
.Tn 284X,
.Tn 2920C,
.Tn 2930U2,
.Tn 2930CU,
.Tn 2940,
.Tn 2940U,
.Tn 2940AU,
.Tn 2940UW,
.Tn 2940UW Dual,
.Tn 2940U2W,
.Tn 2940U2B,
.Tn 2950U2W,
.Tn 2950U2B,
.Tn 29160,
.Tn 3940,
.Tn 3940U,
.Tn 3940AU,
.Tn 3940UW,
.Tn 3940AUW,
.Tn 3940U2W,
.Tn 3950U2,
and
.Tn 3985.
.Pp
Driver features include support for twin and wide busses,
fast, ultra and ultra2 synchronous transfers depending on controller type,
tagged queuing, and SCB paging.
.Pp
Memory mapped I/O can be enabled for PCI devices with the
.Dq Dv AHC_ALLOW_MEMIO
configuration option.
Memory mapped I/O is more efficient than the alternative, programmed I/O.
Most PCI BIOSes will map devices so that either technique for communicating
with the card is available.
In some cases,
usually when the PCI device is sitting behind a PCI->PCI bridge,
the BIOS fails to properly initialize the chip for memory mapped I/O.
The symptom of this problem is usually a system hang if memory mapped I/O
is attempted.
Most modern motherboards perform the initialization correctly and work fine
with this option enabled.
.Pp
Per target configuration performed in the
.Tn SCSI-Select
menu, accessible at boot
in
.No non- Ns Tn EISA
models,
or through an
.Tn EISA
configuration utility for
.Tn EISA
models,
is honored by this driver with the stipulation that the
.Tn BIOS
must be enabled for
.Tn EISA
adaptors.
This includes synchronous/asynchronous transfers, maximum synchronous
negotiation rate, disconnection, the host adapter's SCSI ID, and,
in the case of
.Tn EISA
Twin Channel controllers, the primary channel selection.
.Pp
Performance and feature sets vary throughout the aic7xxx product line.
The following table provides a comparison of the different chips
supported by the
.Nm
driver.
Note that wide and twin channel features, although always supported by a
particular chip, may be disabled in a particular motherboard or card design.

.Sh SCSI CONTROL BLOCKS (SCBs)
Every transaction sent to a device on the SCSI bus is assigned a
.Sq SCSI Control Block
(SCB).
The SCB contains all of the information required by the
controller to process a transaction.
The chip feature table lists the number of SCBs that can be stored
in on chip memory.
All chips with model numbers greater than or equal to 7870 allow for the
on-chip SCB space to be augmented with external SRAM up to a
maximum of 255 SCBs.
Very few Adaptec controller have external SRAM.
.Pp
If external SRAM is not available, SCBs are a limited resource and
using them in a straight forward manner would only allow us to
keep as many transactions as there are SCBs outstanding at a time.
This would not allow enough concurrency to fully utilize the SCSI
bus and its devices.
The solution to this problem is
.Em SCB Paging ,
a concept similar to memory paging.
SCB paging takes advantage of the fact that devices usually disconnect from
the SCSI bus for long periods of time without talking to the controller.
The SCBs for disconnected transactions are only of use to the controller
when the transfer is resumed.
When the host queues another transaction for the controller to execute,
the controller firmware will use a free SCB if one is available.
Otherwise, the state of the most recently disconnected (and therefore most
likely to stay disconnected) SCB is saved, via DMA, to host memory,
and the local SCB reused to start the new transaction.
This allows the controller to queue up to 255 transactions regardless
of the amount of SCB space.
Since the local SCB space serves as a cache for disconnected transactions,
the more SCB space available, the less host bus traffic consumed saving
and restoring SCB data.

.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver, the
.Tn AIC7xxx
sequencer-code assembler, and the firmware running on the aic7xxx chips
were written by
.An Justin T. Gibbs .
.Sh BUGS
Some Quantum drives (at least the Empire 2100 and 1080s) will not run on an
.Tn AIC7870
Rev B in synchronous mode at 10MHz.
Controllers with this problem have a 42 MHz clock crystal on them and
run slightly above 10MHz.
This confuses the drive and hangs the bus.
Setting a maximum synchronous negotiation rate of 8MHz in the
.Tn SCSI-Select
utility will allow normal operation.
