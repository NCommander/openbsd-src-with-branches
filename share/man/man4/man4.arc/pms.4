PS/2 auxiliary port mouse driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pms0 at pcppi?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides an interface to a PS/2 auxiliary port mice.  The driver
offers two modes of operation, both a raw and the old style translated
input stream.  The translating portion of the driver provides BusMouse
codes; in raw mode no translations are performed.
The
.Nm
driver provides three
.Em ioctls
for getting mouse status and changing modes.  They are defined in the
following include:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#include <machine/mouse.h>
.Ed

The
.Dv MOUSEIOCREAD
.Em ioctl
is used to read the current mouse stats, and takes the
.Dv "struct mouseinfo"
as an argument to store the data in.

The
.Dv MOUSEIOCSRAW
.Em ioctl
puts the device into raw mode, if it is not already, and the
.Dv MOUSEIOCSCOOKED
.Em ioctl
puts it into translated (or cooked) mode.  If the mode of the
.Nm
device driver changes, all pending but not yet read input is flushed.
