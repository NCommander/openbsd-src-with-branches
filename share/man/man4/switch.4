.Sh NAME
.Nm switch
.Nd Network switch pseudo device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device switch"
.Pp
.In sys/types.h
.In net/if.h
.In netinet/in.h
.In netinet/if_ether.h
.In net/if_bridge.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides a network interface pseudo-device.
The interface is the forwarding part of a network switch,
and it works along with a controller which usually is 
.Xr switchd 8
or
.Xr switchctl 8 through the device
.Pa /dev/switchN .
As the protocol between the
.Nm
device
and the controller,
OpenFlow 1.3 is supported.
.Pp
A
.Nm
interface is created using the
.Ic ifconfig switch Ns Ar N Ic create
or by opening the character device
.Pa /dev/switchN .
.Pp
.Pa /dev/switchN
is the OpenFlow channel of the interface
.Pa switchN .
It is used for exchanging OpenFlow messages.
The device grantees
.Xr read 2
returns a complete OpenFlow message, it never return a message partially.
The program which uses the
.Pa /dev/switchN
must write(2) per a complete OpenFlow message.
.Sh IOCTLS
A
.Nm
interface responds to all of the
.Xr ioctl 2
calls specific to other interfaces listed in
.Xr netintro 4 .
.Pp
The following
.Xr ioctl 2 
calls are used commonly by
.Nm
and
.Xr bridge 4 .

.Pp
Also the parameter structures are used commonly by
.Nm
and
.Xr bridge 4 .
.Pp
The following
.Xr ioctl
calls are
specific for
.Nm
interface.
They are defined in
.In sys/sockio.h .
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Dv SIOCBRDGADDL Fa "struct ifbreq *"
Add the interface named in
.Va ifbr_ifsname
to the switch named in
.Va ifbr_name
as a local port which connects the local system's network stacks.
Only one
.Xr vether 4
interface can be added as a local port.
.It Dv SIOCSWGDPID
Retrieve the datapath_id in OpenFlow protocol of the switch named in 
.Va ifbrp_name
into
.Va ifbrpu_datapath
field.
.It Dv SIOCSWSDPID Fa "struct ifbrparam"
Set the datapath_id in OpenFlow protocol of the switch named in 
.Va ifbrp_name
to the value in
.Va ifbrpu_datapath
field.
.It Dv SIOCSWGFLOWMAX Fa "struct ifbrparam"
Retrieve the maximum number of flows in OpenFlow protocol of the switch named in
.Va ifbrp_name
into
.Va ifbrp_maxflow
field.
.It Dv SIOCSWSFLOWMAX Fa "struct ifbrparam"
Set the maximum number of flows in OpenFlow protocol of the switch named in 
.Va ifbrp_name
to the value in
.Va ifbrpu_maxflow
field.
.It Dv SIOCSWGMAXGROUP Fa "struct ifbrparam"
Retrieve the maximum number of groups in OpenFlow protocol of the switch named
in 
.Va ifbrp_name
into
.Va ifbrpu_maxgroup
field.
.It Dv SIOCSWSMAXGROUP Fa "struct ifbrparam"
Set the maximum number of groups in OpenFlow protocol of the switch named in 
.Va ifbrp_name
to the value in
.Va ifbrpu_maxgroup
field.
.It Dv SIOCSWSPORTNO Fa "struct ifbreq"
Set the port_no in OpenFlow protocol of the port named in
.Va ifbr_ifsname
of the switch named in
.Va ifbr_name
to
.Va ifbr_portno
field.
