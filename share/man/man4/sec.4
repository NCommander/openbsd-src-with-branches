.Sh NAME
.Nm sec
.Nd route based IPsec VPN tunnel interface pseudo-device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device sec"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides point-to-point tunnel interfaces for IPv4 and IPv6
protected by the
.Xr ipsec 4
Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
protocol.
.Pp
Traffic is encapsulated in the ESP protocol and forwarded to the
remote endpoint by routing over a
.Nm
interface rather than matching policy in the IPsec Security Policy
Database (SPD).
.Nm
interfaces require the configuration of IPsec Security Associations (SAs)
.\" with the interface extension
between the local and remote endpoints.
Negotiation of interface SAs is supported by
.Xr iked 8
and
.Xr isakmpd 8
(the latter via
.Xr ipsecctl 8 ) .
.Pp
.Nm
interfaces can be created at runtime using the
.Ic ifconfig sec Ns Ar N Ic create
command or by setting up a
.Xr hostname.if 5
configuration file for
.Xr netstart 8 .
The interface itself can be configured with
.Xr ifconfig 8 ;
see its manual page for more information.
