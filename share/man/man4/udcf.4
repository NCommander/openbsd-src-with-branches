.Sh NAME
.Nm udcf
.Nd Gude ADS Expert mouseCLOCK DCF77/HBG time signal station receiver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "udcf* at uhub?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Gude ADS Expert mouseCLOCK, a receiver for the
German DCF77 and the Swiss HBG time signal stations.
.Nm
implements a time delta sensor and the delta (in nanoseconds) between the
received time information and the local time can be accessed through the
.Xr sysctl 8
interface.
.Sh CLOCK TYPE
The driver automatically detects if it is receiving the German DCF77 timecode
or the Swiss HBG timecode and indicates the clock type in the sensor
description.
This value will not be changed once set, even when the receiver
module is changed at runtime.
.Bl -tag -width "DCFXX"
.It DCF77
German DCF77 time signal station
(77.5 kHz longwave transmitter located in Mainflingen near Frankfurt)
.It HBG
Swiss HBG time signal station
(75 kHz longwave transmitter located in Prangins near Geneva)
.El
.Sh SENSOR STATES
The quality of the time delta is reported as the sensor status:
.Bl -tag -width "CRITICALXX"
.It OK
The time information is valid and the receiver is fully synchronized to the
time signal station.
The time delta is safe to use for applications like
.Xr ntpd 8 .
.It WARN
The time information is valid, but there has been a reception or parity error.
The sensor value is adjusted using the local clock for at most 15 minutes.
The time delta should be used with care.
.It CRITICAL
No valid time information has been received for more than 15 minutes.
This is an indication that hardware should be checked
to see if it is still functional.
The time delta will eventually degrade to a lie
as all computer internal clocks have a drift.
