.Sh NAME
.Nm hifn
.Nd Hi/fn 7751/7951 crypto accelerator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "hifn* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports various cards containing the Hi/fn 7751 or Hi/Fn 7951
chipsets, such as
.Bl -tag -width namenamenamena -offset indent
.It Invertex AEON
No longer being made.  Came as 128KB SRAM model, or 2MB DRAM model.
.It Hi/fn 7751
Reference board with 512KB SRAM.
.It PowerCrypt
See
.Pa http://www.powercrypt.com/ .
Comes with 512KB SRAM.
.It NetSec 7751
See
.Pa http://www.netsec.net/ .
Supports the most IPsec sessions, with 1MB SRAM.
.It Soekris Engineering vpn1201
Contains a 7951 and supports symmetric and random number operations.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver registers itself to accelerate DES, Triple-DES, MD5-HMAC96,
and SHA1-HMAC96 operations in
.Xr ipsec 4 .
.Pp
The
.Tn Hi/Fn 7951
will also supply data to the kernel
.Xr random 4
subsystem.
.Sh BUGS
The 7751 chip starts out at initialization by only supporting compression.
A proprietary algorithm, which has been reverse engineered, is required to
unlock the cryptographic functionality of the chip.  It is possible for
vendors to make boards which have a lock ID not known to the driver, but
all vendors currently just use the obvious ID which is 13 bytes of 0.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr crypt 3 ,
.Xr ipsec 4 ,
.Xr random 4 ,
.Xr crypto 9
.Sh CAVEATS
The Hi/fn 9751 shares the same PCI id.  This chip is basically a 7751, but
with the cryptographic functions missing.  Instead, the 9751 is only capable
of doing compression.  Since we do not currently attempt to use any of
these chips to do compression, the 9751-based cards are not useful.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 2.7 .
