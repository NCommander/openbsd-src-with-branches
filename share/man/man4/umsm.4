.Sh NAME
.Nm umsm
.Nd Qualcomm MSM modem device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "umsm* at uhub?"
.Cd "ucom* at umsm?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports Qualcomm MSM modem adapters.
The MSM chipset is found in EDVO and UMTS capable modems.
Typically
these are CardBus and MiniPCI cards that incorporate a USB controller
with the actual device attached to it.
.Pp
The following devices are known to work with the
.Nm
driver:
.Pp
.Bl -column "Device                " "Bus" -compact -offset 6n
.It Em "Device	Bus"
.It Li "AirPrime PC5220" Ta Cardbus
.It Li "Kyocera KPC650" Ta Cardbus
.It Li "Sierra Wireless MC8755" Ta MiniPCI
.El
.Pp
Devices suspected of being compatible are:
.Pp
.Bl -column "Device                " "Bus" -compact -offset 6n
.It Em "Device		Bus"
.It Li "Novatel Wireless Merlin V620" Ta Cardbus
.It Li "Sierra Wireless AirCard 580" Ta Cardbus
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
An example
.Pa /etc/ppp/ppp.conf
configuration for Verizon Wireless might look something like below;
see
.Xr ppp 8
for more information.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
default:
   set device /dev/cuaU0
   set speed 230400
   set dial "ABORT BUSY ABORT NO\e\esCARRIER TIMEOUT 5 \e
             \e"\e" AT OK-AT-OK ATE1Q0s7=60 OK \e\edATDT\e\eT TIMEOUT 40 CONNECT"
   set phone "#777"
   set login
   set authname 4517654321@vzw3g.com
   set authkey vzw
   set timeout 120
   set ifaddr 10.0.0.1/0 10.0.0.2/0 255.255.255.0 0.0.0.0
   add default HISADDR
   enable dns

.Pp
In this example the phone number is (451) 765-4321: replace this with
the number issued for the card or your phone's number if a handset is being
used.
