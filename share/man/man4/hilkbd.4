.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm hilkbd
.Nd HIL keyboard driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "hilkbd* at hil?"
.Cd "wskbd* at hilkbd? console ?"
.Cd "option HILKBD_LAYOUT=XXX"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver supports HIL keyboards within the
.Xr wscons 4
framework.
It doesn't prowide direct device driver entry points, but makes its
functions available through the internal
.Xr wskbd 4
interface.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports a number of different key mappings.
By default, the layout corresponding to the keyboard model as probed
by the
.Nm
driver will be used.
A different layout can be chosen either with the kernel option
.Dq HILKBD_LAYOUT
at compile time, or with the
.Xr wsconsctl 8
utility (variable:
.Dq keyboard.encoding
) at runtime.
.Pp
The supported key mappings are at this time:
.Bl -hang
.It KB_FR
(
.Dq fr
) French with
.Dq dead accents .
.It KB_SV
(
.Dq sv
) Swedish.
.It KB_UK
(
.Dq uk
) British.
.It KB_US
(
.Dq us
) English / US keyboard mapping.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To set a swedish keyboard mapping, use
.Ic wsconsctl -w keyboard.encoding=sv .
To set it at kernel build time, regardless of what keyboard is plugged, add
.Em option HILKBD_LAYOUT="KB_SV"
to the kernel configuration file.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr hil 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr wskbd 4 ,
.Xr wsconsctl 8
.Sh BUGS
The list of built-in mappings doesn't follow any logics.
It grew as people submitted what they needed.
