ADMtek AL981 Comet and AN985 Centaur Fast Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "al* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCI Ethernet adapters and embedded
controllers based on the ADMtek Inc. AL981 Comet and AN 985
Centaur Fast Ethernet controller chips.
.Pp
The ADMtek chip uses bus master DMA and is designed to be a
DEC 21x4x workalike. The only major difference between the DEC
and ADMtek parts is that the ADMtek receiver filter is programmed
using two special registers where as the DEC chip is programmed
by uploading a special setup frame via the transmit DMA engine.
The AL981 and AN985 can only be programmed with a single
perfect filter entry for the local station address and a 64-bit
multicast hash table; the DEC filter supports several other
options. The ADMtek Fast Ethernet controllers support both
10 and 100Mbps speeds in either full or half duplex using
an internal MII transceiver.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
fine.
.It 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation. The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex modes.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation. The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It full-duplex
Force full-duplex operation.
.It half-duplex
Force half-duplex operation.
.El

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "ax%d: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "ax%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "ax%d: watchdog timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
.It "ax%d: no memory for rx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the receiver ring.
.It "ax%d: no memory for tx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the transmitter ring when
allocating a pad buffer or collapsing an mbuf chain into a cluster.
.It "ax%d: chip is in D3 power state -- setting to D0"
This message applies only to adapters which support power
management. Some operating systems place the controller in low power
mode when shutting down, and some PCI BIOSes fail to bring the chip
out of this state before configuring it. The controller loses all of
its PCI configuration in the D3 state, so if the BIOS does not set
it back to full power mode in time, it won't be able to configure it
correctly. The driver tries to detect this condition and bring
the adapter back to the D0 (full power) state, but this may not be
enough to return the driver to a fully operational condition. If
you see this message at boot time and the driver fails to attach
the device as a network interface, you will have to perform second
warm boot to have the device properly configured.
.Pp
Note that this condition only occurs when warm booting from another
operating system. If you power down your system prior to booting
.Fx ,
the card should be configured correctly.
