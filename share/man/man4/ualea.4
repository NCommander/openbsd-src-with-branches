.Sh NAME
.Nm ualea
.Nd Araneus Alea II USB TRNG
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ualea* at uhub?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Araneus Alea II, a USB true random
number generator (TRNG).
It delivers 100kbit/sec of hardware-generated entropy.
.Nm
reads raw entropy from the Alea II and uses
.Xr add_true_randomness 9
to add it to the system entropy pool.
.Pp
The product documentation states that the USB interface used by the
Alea II is the same as that used by its predecessor the Alea I;
theoretically this means that the Alea I should work but this has not
been tested.
