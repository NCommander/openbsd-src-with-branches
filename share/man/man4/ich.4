.Nm ich
.Nd Intel 82801AA/AB and 440MX AC'97 audio driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ich* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "audio* at ich?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for AC'97 audio present on Intel 82801AA/AB
I/O Controller hub and 82440MX chipset.
DMA engine supports full duplex operation and separate DMA channels
for line input and microphone. Although similtaneous recording
from both line and microphone inputs is not supported, due
to current
.Xr ac97 4
design.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ac97 4 ,
.Xr audio 4 ,
.Xr mixer 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 2.7 .
.Sh BUGS
This chipset supports only 48KHz rate for both DAC and ADC operation,
unfortunately some audio applications have poor support for this rate
and mpg123 is one of those cases.
