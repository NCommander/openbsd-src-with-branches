.Bl -diag
.It de0: hardware address ....
This is a normal autoconfiguration message noting the 6 byte physical
Ethernet address of the adapter.
.It de0: oerror, flags=... tdrerr=....
The hardware indicated an error
in transmitting a packet to the cable.
The status and error flags are reported.
.It de0: ierror, flags=... lenerr=... (len=N).
The hardware indicated an error
in reading a packet from the cable.
The status and error flags are reported.
.It de0: buffer unavailable.
The interface received more packets
than it had buffers allocated to receive them.
.El
.Pp
The following messages indicate a probable hardware error performing
the indicated operation during autoconfiguration or initialization.
