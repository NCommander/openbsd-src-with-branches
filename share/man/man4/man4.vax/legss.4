.Sh NAME
.Nm legss
.Nd Low-End Graphics Subsystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "legss* at mbus0 mid 7"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at legss?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an 8-bit color frame buffer found in VAXstation 35x0 and 38x0 series.
An optional VCB03 16 plane option expands it to a 24-bit color frame buffer.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver interfaces the frame buffer with the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
It does not provide direct device driver entry points
but makes its functions available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr mbus 4 ,
.Xr wscons 4 ,
.Xr wsdisplay 4
.Sh BUGS
The 16 plane option is currently not supported, and needs to be removed
for the
.Nm
driver to operate properly.
