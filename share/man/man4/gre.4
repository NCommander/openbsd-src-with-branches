.Dt GRE 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm gre
.Nd encapsulating network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd pseudo-device gre Op Ar count
.Sh NOTE
.Tn GRE ,
.Tn WCCPv1 ,
and
.Tn MobileIP
are enabled with the following
.Xr sysctl 3
variables respectively in
.Pa /etc/sysctl.conf :
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It net.inet.gre.allow
Allow GRE packets in and out of the system.
.It net.inet.gre.wccp
Allow WCCPv2-style GRE packets into the system (depends on the above).
.It net.inet.mobileip.allow
Allow MobileIP packets in and out of the system.
.El
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
network interface allows tunnel construction using the Cisco GRE or
the Mobile-IP (RFC 2004) encapsulation protocols.
.Pp
This driver currently supports the following modes of operation:
.Bl -tag -width abc
.It GRE encapsulation (IP protocol number 47).
Encapsulated datagrams are prepended by an outer datagram and a GRE header.
The GRE header specifies the type of the encapsulated datagram
and thus allows for tunneling other protocols than IP like
e.g. AppleTalk.
GRE mode is the default tunnel mode on Cisco routers.
This is also the default mode of operation of the
.Sy gre Ns Ar X
interfaces.
.It MOBILE encapsulation (IP protocol number 55).
Datagrams are encapsulated into IP, but with a much smaller
encapsulation header.
This protocol only supports IP in IP encapsulation, and is intended
for use with mobile IP.
.El
.Pp
The network interfaces are named
.Sy gre Ns Ar 0 ,
.Sy gre Ns Ar 1 ,
etc.
The number of interfaces is given by the corresponding
.Sy pseudo-device
line in the system config file.
.Nm gre
interfaces support the following
.Xr ioctl 2 Ns s :
.Bl -tag -width aaa
.It GRESADDRS:
Set the IP address of the local tunnel end.
.It GRESADDRD:
Set the IP address of the remote tunnel end.
.It GREGADDRS:
Query the IP address that is set for the local tunnel end.
.It GREGADDRD:
Query the IP address that is set for the remote tunnel end.
.It GRESPROTO:
Set the operation mode to the specified IP protocol value.
The protocol is passed to the interface in (struct ifreq)->ifr_flags.
The operation mode can also be given as
.Bl -tag -width bbb
.It link0
IPPROTO_GRE
.It -link0
IPPROTO_MOBILE
.El
.It GREGPROTO:
Query operation mode.
.El
.Pp
Note that the IP addresses of the tunnel endpoints may be the same as the
ones defined with
.Xr ifconfig 8
for the interface (as if IP is encapsulated), but need not be, as e.g. when
encapsulating AppleTalk.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Configuration example:
.Bd -literal


Host X-- Host A  ----------------tunnel---------- Cisco D------Host E
          \\                                          |
           \\                                        /
             +------Host B----------Host C----------+

.Ed
On Host A (OpenBSD):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# route add default B
# ifconfig greN A D netmask 0xffffffff linkX up
# ifconfig greN tunnel A D
# route add E D
.Ed
.Pp
On Host D (Cisco):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Interface TunnelX
 ip unnumbered D   ! e.g. address from Ethernet interface
 tunnel source D   ! e.g. address from Ethernet interface
 tunnel destination A
ip route C <some interface and mask>
ip route A mask C
ip route X mask tunnelX
.Ed
.Pp
OR
.Pp
On Host D (OpenBSD):
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# route add default C
# ifconfig greN D A
# ifconfig greN tunnel D A
.Ed
.Pp
To reach Host A over the tunnel (from host D), there has to be an
alias on Host A for the Ethernet interface:
.Dl ifconfig <etherif> alias Y
and on the Cisco
.Dl ip route Y mask tunnelX
.Sh NOTE
For correct operation, the
.Nm
device needs a route to the destination, that is less specific than the
one over the tunnel.
(There needs to be a route to the decapsulating host that
does not run over the tunnel, as this would create a loop.)
.Pp
In order for
.Xr ifconfig 8
to actually mark the interface as up, the keyword ``up'' must be given
last on its command line.
.Pp
The kernel must be set to forward datagrams by including option
``GATEWAY'' in the kernel config file and issuing the appropriate
option to
.Xr sysctl 8 .
.Pp
The GRE interface will accept WCCPv1-style GRE encapsulated packets
from a Cisco router.
Some magic with the packet filter configuration
and a caching proxy like squid are needed to do anything useful with
these packets.

.Sh BUGS
The compute_route() code in
.Pa net/if_gre.c
toggles the last bit of the IP-address to provoke the search for a less
specific route than the one directly over the tunnel to prevent loops.
This is possibly not the best solution.
.Pp
To avoid the address munging described above, turn on the link1 flag
on the ifconfig command line.
This implies that the GRE packet destination and the remote host are not
the same IP addresses, and that the GRE destination does not route over
the
.Sy gre Ns Ar X
interface itself.
.Pp
GRE RFC not yet fully implemented (no GRE options).
.Pp
For the WCCP GRE encapsulated packets we can only reliably accept
WCCPv1 format; WCCPv2 formatted packets add another header which will
skew the decode, and results are not defined (i.e. don't do WCCPv2).
