Concluding, all of the above CPUs are dual-issue, or 2-way superscalar,
with the exception that on CPUs with two INT units only one of these units 
is capable of doing shift, load/store and test operations.
Additionally there are several kinds of restrictions placed upon the superscalar
execution:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
functional unit contention
.It
data dependency restrictions
.It
control flow restrictions
.It
special intruction restrictions

.Pp
.Sh PERFORMANCE MONITOR COPROCESSOR
The performance monitor coprocessor is an optional,
implementation-dependent coprocessor which provides a minimal common
software interface to implementation-dependent performance monitor hardware.
.Pp
.Sh DEBUG SPECIAL UNIT
The debug special function unit is an optional,
architected SFU which provides hardware assistance for software debugging
using breakpoints.
The debug SFU is currently defined only for Level 0 processors.
