.Sh NAME
.Nm ie
.Nd Intel i82C596 DX/CA LAN Coprocessor as found in HP9000 workstations
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ie0 at gsc? irq 8"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10 Mb/s
.Tn Ethernet
network via the 
.Tn Intel
i82C596 DX/CA 32-bit
Local Area Network Coprocessor for Ethernet
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and
.Tn Ethernet
addresses on the local network.
.Pp
The i82C596 Coprocessors come basically in two different flavors:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width i82596DXxxx
.It i82596DX
Systems with a ASP or WAX Main Bus Adapter (MBA), e.g. 720, 735 etc.
These types of systems generally have only AUI or BNC and AUI connectors at
the back. On the models with both you usually have to switch a big
jumper-block on the mainboard to choose which one to activate.
.It i82596CA
Systems with LASI MBA, e.g. 712/*, 715/100.
have the i82C59CA 
integrated on the LASI macrochip. They usually have TP and AUI 
connectors and autodetect to which one the network is connected to.
.El
.Pp
By default, the system will select the media type automatically, but the
.Xr ifconfig 8
command can be used to force the media selection.
The media types are shown below:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxx -offset indent
.It media autoselect
Attempt to autoselect the media type (default)
.It media 10base5
Use the AUI connector
.It media 10baseT
Use the twisted pair connector
.It media 10base2
Use the BNC connector
