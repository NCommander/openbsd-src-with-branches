.Dt GNOME-MODULE 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm gnome-module
.Nd x11/gnome port module
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents the behavior of setting
.Li MODULE=x11/gnome
in the
.Xr ports 7
tree.
.Pp
This module has full support for the
.Ar gnu ,
.Ar simple
and
.Ar cmake
CONFIGURE_STYLE.
.Pp
If both
.Ev GNOME_PROJECT
and
.Ev GNOME_VERSION
are set, this module defines
.Ev DISTNAME ,
.Ev VERSION ,
.Ev MASTER_SITES ,
adds x11/gnome to
.Ev CATEGORIES
and
.Ev EXTRACT_SUFX
will default to .tar.xz if unset.
Unless
.Li NO_BUILD=Yes ,
.Pa textproc/intltool
is also appended to
.Ev MODULES
and when CONFIGURE_STYLE is set to
.Ar gnu
or
.Ar simple ,
.Ev USE_GMAKE
is set to "Yes".
.Pp
When CONFIGURE_STYLE is set to
.Ar gnu
or
.Ar simple ,
if none of
.Ev AUTOCONF_VERSION
nor
.Ev AUTOMAKE_VERSION
are defined, then "--disable-maintainer-mode" is appended to
.Ev CONFIGURE_ARGS .
When CONFIGURE_STYLE is set to
.Ar cmake ,
"-DENABLE_MAINTAINER_MODE=OFF" and -DSYSCONF_INSTALL_DIR=${SYSCONFDIR}
are appended to CONFIGURE_ARGS.
.Pp
MODGNOME_CPPFLAGS and MODGNOME_LDFLAGS can be used to add compiler and linker
flags.
.Li CPPFLAGS="-I${LOCALBASE}/include"
and
.Li LDFLAGS="-L${LOCALBASE}/lib"
are always appended to
.Ev CONFIGURE_ENV .
.Pp
Certain build/run dependencies and configure arguments and environment
can be set by appending desktop-file-utils, docbook, gobject-introspection,
gtk-update-icon-cache, shared-mime-info, vala and/or yelp to
.Ev MODGNOME_TOOLS .
They are disabled otherwise.
If
.Ev MODGNOME_TOOLS
is set to desktop-file-utils,
a dependency on
.Pa devel/desktop-file-utils
is appended to
.Ev MODGNOME_RUN_DEPENDS
and a link to /usr/bin/true is created under
.Pa ${WRKDIR}/bin/desktop-file-validate .
If
.Ev MODGNOME_TOOLS
is set to docbook,
.Pa textproc/docbook-xsl
is appended to
.Ev MODGNOME_BUILD_DEPENDS .
This option is used when the generation of the man pages included in the
source tarball requires docbook XML/SGML/XSL definitions and stylesheets.
If
.Ev MODGNOME_TOOLS
is set to gtk-update-icon-cache, a dependency on
.Pa x11/gtk+3,-guic
is appended to
.Ev MODGNOME_RUN_DEPENDS .
If
.Ev MODGNOME_TOOLS
is set to shared-mime-info, a dependency on
.Pa misc/shared-mime-info
is appended to
.Ev MODGNOME_RUN_DEPENDS
and a link to /usr/bin/true is created under
.Pa ${WRKDIR}/bin/update-mime-database .
If
.Ev MODGNOME_TOOLS
is set to yelp,
.Pa textproc/itstool
and
.Pa x11/gnome/doc-utils
are appended to
.Ev MODGNOME_BUILD_DEPENDS .
Furthermore,
.Pa x11/gnome/yelp
is appended to
.Ev MODGNOME_RUN_DEPENDS
if
.Ev MODGNOME_TOOLS
also contains "desktop-file-utils"
This option is to be used when any files are installed into
.Pa share/gnome/help/
or page files are installed into
.Pa share/help/ .
.Ev MODGNOME_BUILD_DEPENDS
and
.Ev MODGNOME_RUN_DEPENDS
are appended to the
corresponding
.Ev BUILD_DEPENDS
and
.Ev RUN_DEPENDS .
.Pp
Some tools require the following goo in the PLIST:

.Bd -literal -offset indent
@exec %D/bin/update-desktop-database
@unexec-delete %D/bin/update-desktop-database
