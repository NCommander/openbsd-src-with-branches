.Sh NAME
.Nm passwd.conf
.Nd format of the password configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm /etc/passwd.conf
file describes the configuration of the password cipher used
to encrypt local or YP passwords. The
.Nm passwd.conf
consists of stanzas. 
.Pp
There are default, user and group specific stanzas. If no user 
or group
stanza to a specific option is available the default stanza
is used.
.Pp
To differentiate between user and group stanzas, groups are prefixed 
with a single dot.
.Pp
Some of the fields  and  their possible values that can appear in
this file are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width localcipher -offset indent
.It localcipher
The cipher to use for local passwords. Possible values are: 'old', 'newsalt,<rounds>', 'md5' or 'blowfish,<rounds>'.
For 
.Nm newsalt
the value of rounds is a 24-bit integer with a minmum of 7250 rounds.
For
.Nm blowfish
the value can be between 4 and 31. It specifies the base 2 logarithm of
the number of rounds.
.It ypcipher
The cipher to use for YP passwords. The possible values are the same as
for localcipher.
.El
.Pp
To retrieve information from this file use
.Xr pw_getconf 3 .
.Pp
.Sh EXAMPLE
To use blowfish as local cipher and some more rounds for root and wheel
members. The old unix crypt is used as YP cipher:
.Bd -literal
 default:
      localcipher = blowfish,4
      ypcipher = old

 root:
      localcipher = blowfish,7

 .wheel:
      localcipher = blowfish,5
