.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm python-module
.Nd lang/python port module
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents the behavior of setting
.Li MODULE=lang/python
in the
.Xr ports 7
tree.
.Pp
Sets
.Ev MODPY_VERSION ,
.Ev MODPY_BIN ,
.Ev MODPY_INCDIR ,
.Ev MODPY_LIBDIR ,
.Ev MODPY_SITEPKG ,
.Ev MODPY_SETUP ,
.Ev MODPY_TEST_DIR ,
.Ev MODPY_TEST_LOCALE ,
.Ev MODPY_WANTLIB ,
.Ev MODPY_LIB_DEPENDS ,
.Ev MODPY_RUN_DEPENDS ,
.Ev MODPY_TEST_DEPENDS ,
.Ev MODPY_BUILD_DEPENDS ,
and
.Ev MODPY_ADJ_FILES .
Appends to
.Ev RUN_DEPENDS
unless
.Ev MODPY_RUNDEP
is set to No.
Appends to
.Ev BUILD_DEPENDS
unless
.Ev MODPY_BUILDDEP
is set to No or
.Ev NO_BUILD
is set to Yes.
Appends to
.Ev TEST_DEPENDS
if
.Ev MODPY_PYTEST
is set to Yes
unless
.Ev MODPY_TESTDEP
is set to No.
Appends
.Ev MODPY_TEST_LOCALE
to
.Ev TEST_ENV .
Changes to the directory specified in
.Ev MODPY_TEST_DIR ,
by default WRKSRC, before running tests.
.Ev MODPY_VERSION
is the default version used by all python modules.
Ports which use the setuptools module should set
.Ev MODPY_SETUPTOOLS
to Yes.
Ports which use the pytest module should set
.Ev MODPY_PYTEST
to Yes.
Arguments can be passed to pytest during
.Cm test
with
.Ev MODPY_PYTEST_ARGS .
All ports that generate egg-info files should set
.Ev MODPY_EGG_VERSION
to the version string used by the
.Fn setup
function in the port's
.Pa setup.py .
Arguments can be passed to setup.py during
.Cm configure
with
.Ev MODPY_SETUP_ARGS .
Extra arguments to the build and install commands can be passed via
.Ev MODPY_DISTUTILS_BUILDARGS
and
.Ev MODPY_DISTUTILS_INSTALLARGS .
If any files have a python shebang line which needs to be replaced
using MODPY_BIN, list them in
.Ev MODPY_ADJ_FILES .
These are prefixed with WRKSRC and replaced automatically
at the end of
.Cm pre-configure .
Also affects
.Ev CATEGORIES ,
.Ev MAKE_ENV ,
.Ev CONFIGURE_ENV ,
and
.Ev SUBST_VARS .
May affect the
.Cm test
target.
If
.Ev MODPY_PI
is set to Yes it will set
.Ev HOMEPAGE
and
.Ev MASTER_SITES .
The subdirectory can be overridden with
.Ev MODPY_PI_DIR .
.Pp
Python 2.x places .pyc files in the same directory as the associated .py file.
Python 3.x places these in a separate __pycache__ directory and uses an
additional suffix.
In some cases, an ABI tag is also used for names of compiled extensions.
The python module defines variables to allow a single PLIST to be
used for both versions.
Generate or update the PLIST using the python3
.Ev FLAVOR ,
then edit it to prefix any lines creating
.Ev MODPY_PYCACHE
directories with
.Ev MODPY_COMMENT .
As python2 and python3 packages should permit being installed together,
it may be necessary to suffix names of common binaries or directories,
or split common files into a subpackage.
If updating the PLIST without using the python3 flavor,
take care not to remove ${MODPY_PYCACHE}, ${MODPY_PYC_MAGIC_TAG}, or
${MODPY_ABI_TAG} variables from the PLIST.
