.Sh NAME
.Nm login.conf
.Nd login class capability database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /etc/login.conf
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file describes the various attributes of login classes.
A login class determines session resource limits and environment setup.
It is used by various programs in the system to set up a user's login
environment and to enforce local policy and restrictions.
At a future date, the login class will also determine what styles of
authentication are available to a user.
.Pp
A special record,
.Dq default ,
in
.Pa /etc/login.conf
is used for any user without a valid login class in
.Pa /etc/master.passwd .
.Sh CAPABILITIES
Refer to
.Xr getcap 3
for a description of the file layout.
All entries in the
.Nm
file are either boolean or use a
.Ql =
to separate the capability from the value.
The types are described after the capability table.

.Pp
The resource limit entries
.No ( Ns Va cputime , filesize , datasize , stacksize , coredumpsize ,
.Va memoryuse , memorylocked , maxproc ,
and
.Va openfiles )
actually specify both the maximum and current limits (see
.Xr getrlimit 2 ).
The current limit is the one normally used, although the user is permitted
to increase the current limit to the maximum limit.
The maximum and current limits may be specified individually by appending a
.Va \-max
or
.Va \-cur
to the capability name (e.g.,
.Va openfiles-max
and
.Va openfiles-cur Ns No ).
.Pp
\*(oSwill never define capabilities which start with
.Li x-
or
.Li X- ,
these are reserved for external use (unless included through contributed
software).
.Pp
The argument types are defined as:
.Bl -tag -width programxx
.\"
.It file
Path name to a text file.
.\"
.It list
A comma separated list of values.
.\"
.It number
A number.
A leading
.Li 0x
implies the number is expressed in hexadecimal.
A leading
.Li 0
implies the number is expressed in octal.
Any other number is treated as decimal.
.\"
.It path
A space separated list of path names.
If a
.Li ~
is the first character in the path name, the
.Li ~
is expanded to the user's home directory.
.\"
.It program

.\"
.It size
A
.Va number
which expresses a size in bytes.
It may have a trailing
.Li b
to multiply the value by 512, a
.Li k
to multiply the value by 1 K (1024), and a
.Li m
to multiply the value by 1 M (1048576).
.\"
.It time
A time in seconds.
A time may be expressed as a series of numbers which are added together.
Each number may have a trailing character to represent time units:
.Bl -tag -width xxx
.\"
.It y
