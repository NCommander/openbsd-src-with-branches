.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm bsd.port.mk
.Nd ports tree master Makefile fragment
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <bsd.port.mk>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm 
holds all the standard routines used by the ports tree.  Some variables
and targets are for its internal use only.  The rest is documented here.
.Pp
Other BSD, and older versions of 
.Nm
included other targets and variables. Conversion methods are outlined here.
.Pp
This is an incomplete draft, most variables and targets are not yet
documented.
.Sh TARGETS
.Bl -tag -width do-configure
.El
.Sh VARIABLES
.Bl -tag -width MASTER_SITES
.It Ev ARCH
Current machine architecture (read-only).
.It BUILD_DEPENDS
List of other ports the current port needs to build correctly.
Each item has the form 
.Sq file_to_test::directory[:target] .
The double :: is designed to allow wedging a package specification in the
near future.  
.Sq target 
defaults to 
.Sq install
if it is not specified.
.Sq file_to_test 
is checked against the current path, or as an absolute
file name. The special name /nonexistent can be used to force a build
dependency (see the ghostscript port for an example).
.Sq directory 
is set relative to ${PORTSDIR}.
Build dependencies are checked at the beginning of the extract stage.
.It Ev CDROM_PACKAGES
Base location where packages suitable for a CDROM (see
PERMIT_PACKAGE_CDROM) will be placed 
(default: ${PORTSDIR}/cdrom-packages/${ARCH})
.It Ev CLEANDEPENDS
If set to 
.Sq Yes
.Sq make clean
will also clean dependencies. Note that distclean  never recurses down to
dependencies.
.It Ev DIST_SUBDIR
Optionally subdirectory of ${DISTDIR} where the current port's distfiles
and patchfiles will be located. See target fetch.
.It Ev FAKE
Automatically set to 
.Sq Yes
for most ports (and all new ports). Indicates that the port, using
.Ev FAKE_FLAGS 
magic, will properly fake installation into ${WRKINST}, to be packaged
and properly installed from the package.  Set to 
.Sq No
in very rare cases, and during port creation.
.It Ev FETCH_DEPENDS
See BUILD_DEPENDS for specification.  Fetch dependencies are checked at
the beginning of the extract stage. No current port uses FETCH_DEPENDS.
.It Ev FILESDIR
Location of other files related to the current ports. Holds at least the
checksum file, and sometimes other files (default: files.${ARCH} or files).
.It Ev FTP_PACKAGES
Base location where packages suitable for ftp (see
PERMIT_PACKAGE_FTP) will be placed 
(default: ${PORTSDIR}/ftp-packages/${ARCH})
.It Ev LIB_DEPENDS
Libraries this port depends upon. Similar to BUILD_DEPENDS, except that
.Sq file_to_test
is replaced by a 
.Sq lib_spec
of the form:
.Sq libname.[version.[subversion]] .
See BUGS AND LIMITATIONS as well.
.It Ev FULLDISTDIR
Complete path to directory where ${DISTFILES} and ${PATCHFILES} will be
located, to be used in hand-crafted extraction targets (read-only).
.It Ev IS_INTERACTIVE
Set to
.Sq Yes
if port needs human interaction to build. Usually implies NO_PACKAGE as
well.  Porters should strive to minimize IS_INTERACTIVE ports, by using
FLAVORS for multiple choice ports, and by postponing human intervention
to package installation time.
.It Ev LOCALBASE
where other ports have already been installed (default: /usr/local)
.It Ev MAKE_PROGRAM
The make program that is used for building the port. Set to ${MAKE} or
${GMAKE} depending on USE_GMAKE. Read-only.
.It Ev NEED_VERSION
Specific revision of 
.Nm 
needed by this ports tree. Usually set to the current version of 
.Nm
when port was built, and updated by port maintainers when needed.
.It Ev NO_SHARED_LIBS
Set to 
.Sq Yes
if platform does not support shared libraries.  To be tested after
including 
.Nm bsd.port.mk ,
if neither PFRAG.SHARED nor CONFIGURE_SHARED are enough.
.It Ev OPSYS
Always OpenBSD (read-only).
.It Ev OPSYS_VER
Revision number of OpenBSD (read-only).
.It Ev PACKAGES
Base location for packages built (default: ${PORTSDIR}/packages/${ARCH}).
.It Ev PATCHDIR
Location for patches applied by patch target (default: patches.${ARCH} or
patches).
.It Ev PATCH_LIST
Wildcard pattern of patches to select under ${PATCHDIR} (default: patch-*).
Note that filenames ending in .orig, or ~ are never applied.
.It Ev PORTSDIR
Root of the ports tree (default: /usr/ports).
.It Ev PKGDIR
Location for packaging information (packing list, port description, port
short description). Default: pkg.${ARCH} or pkg.
.It Ev PREFIX
Base directory for the current port installation. Usually ${LOCALBASE},
though some ports may elect a location under /var, and some multi-packages
ports may install under several locations.
.It Ev RUN_DEPENDS
Specification of ports this port needs installed to be functional.
Same format as BUILD_DEPENDS.  The corresponding packages will be built at
.Ar install
stage, and 
.Xr pkg_add 1
will take care of installing them.
.It Ev SCRIPTDIR
Location for scripts related to the current port (default: scripts.${ARCH}
or scripts).
.It Ev SYSCONFDIR
Location for ports system configuration files. Defaults to /etc, should
never be set to /usr/local/etc.
.It Ev TEMPLATES
Base location for the templates used in the readme target.
.It Ev WRKINST
Subdirectory of ${WRKDIR} where port normally installs (see 
.Ar fake 
target).
.It Ev X11BASE
Where X11 has been installed (default: /usr/X11R6).
.It Ev USE_GMAKE
Set to
.Sq Yes
if gnu make is needed for correct behavior of this port.
.El
.Sh OBSOLETE TARGETS
.Bl -tag -width do-configure
.El
.Sh OBSOLETE VARIABLES
.Bl -tag -width MASTER_SITES
.It Ev NO_CONFIGURE
If ${FILESDIR}/configure does
.It Ev NO_EXTRACT
Set EXTRACT_ONLY=  instead.
.It Ev NO_PATCH
The absence of a patches directory does the same. Use PATCH_DIR and
PATCH_LIST if patches must be changed dynamically.
.It Ev NO_WRKDIR
All ports should have a working directory, as this is necessary to store
cookies and keep state.
.It Ev NO_WRKSUBDIR
The same functionality is obtained by setting WRKDIST=${WRKDIR} .
.It Ev NOCLEANDEPENDS
Use CLEANDEPENDS instead.
.It Ev NOMANCOMPRESS
.Fx
ships with compressed man pages, and uses this variable to control
that behavior.
.It Ev PATCH_SITES
.Ev PATCH_FILES 
used to be retrieved from a separate site list. For greater flexibility,
all files are now retrieved from 
.Ev MASTER_SITES ,
.Ev MASTER_SITES0 ,...
.Ev MASTER_SITES9 ,
using a 
.Sq :0 
to
.Sq :9
extension to the file name, e.g., 
.Bd -litteral -offset indent
	PATCH_FILES=foo.diff.gz
	PATCH_SITES=ftp://ftp.zoinx.org/pub/
.Ed
becomes

.Bd -litteral -offset indent
	PATCH_FILES=foo.diff.gz:0
	MASTER_SITES0=ftp://ftp.zoinx.org/pub/
.Ed
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width files/md5
.It Pa ../Makefile.inc
Common Makefile fragment for a set of ports, included automatically.
.It Pa Makefile.${ARCH}
Arch-dependent Makefile fragment, included automatically.
.It Pa ${FILESDIR}/md5
Checksum file. Holds the output of 
.Xr md5 1 ,
.Xr sha1 1 
and
.Xr rmd160 1
for the ports ${DISTFILES} and ${PATCHFILES}.
.It Pa ${PKGDIR}/DESCR
Description for the port. Variables such as ${HOMEPAGE} will be expanded
(see SUBST_VARS). Multi-packages ports will use DESCR${SUBPACKAGE}.
.It Pa ${PKGDIR}/COMMENT
Short, one line description of the port, that is displayed by 
.Xr pkg_info 1 ,
and appears in 
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/INDEX .
Name will be adjusted for flavored and multi-packages ports.
.El
.Sh OBSOLETE FILES
.Bl -tag -width files/md5
.It Pa ${SCRIPTDIR}/{pre,do,post}-*
Identical functionality can be obtained through a {pre,do,post}-* target,
invoking the script manually if necessary.
.It Pa ${PKGDIR}/PLIST.noshared
Use PFRAG.shared or PFRAG.no-shared instead.  PLIST.noshared was too easy
to forget when updating ports.
.It Pa ${PKGDIR}/PLIST.sed
Use PLIST directly. Until revision 1.295,
.Nm
did not substitute variables in the packing list unless this special form
was used.
.It Pa /usr/share/mk/bsd.port.mk
Original location of 
.Nm .
The current file lives under ${PORTSDIR}/infrastructure/mk/bsd.port.mk,
whereas /usr/share/mk/bsd.port.mk is just a stub.
.It Pa {scripts,files,patches}.${OPSYS}
The 
.Ox
ports tree focuses on robustness, not on being portable to other operating
systems.
.It Pa /usr/local/etc
Used by
.Fx
to marshall system configuration files. All
.Ox
system configuration files are located in /etc, or in a subdirectory of
/etc.
.El
.Sh BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
.Ev LOCALBASE ,
.Ev X11BASE
and
.Ev PREFIX
are not heeded consistently. Most of the ports tree will probably fall
apart if one tries to build/use stuff elsewhere.
.Pp
.Ev LIB_DEPENDS 
is automatically both a BUILD_DEPENDS and a RUN_DEPENDS, whereas some
smarter, more intricate mechanism could be designed to minimize dependencies.
.Sh HISTORY
The ports mechanism originally came from
.Fx .
A lot of additions were taken from 
.Nx
over the years.
.Pp
When the file grew too large, Marc Espie cleaned it up to restore some of
its speed and remove a lot of bugs.
