.Dt CARGO-MODULE 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm cargo-module
.Nd devel/cargo port module
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents the behavior of setting
.Li MODULE=devel/cargo
in the
.Xr ports 7
tree.
.Pp
Automates download and compilation of dependencies of a Rust project using
.Xr cargo 1 .
During
.Cm fetch ,
static dependencies ("crates") listed in
.Ev MODCARGO_CRATES
are downloaded using
.Ev MODCARGO_DIST_SUBDIR
as
.Ev DIST_SUBDIR .
During
.Cm post-extract ,
crates defined in
.Ev MODCARGO_CRATES
are moved to the
.Ev MODCARGO_VENDOR_DIR
directory.
During
.Cm post-patch ,
crate-metadata are generated using
.Pa devel/cargo-generate-vendor .
With
.Ev CONFIGURE_STYLE
set to
.Sq cargo ,
cargo is configured to use
.Ev MODCARGO_VENDOR_DIR
instead of the standard crates-io network source.
Finally, any crates listed in
.Ev MODCARGO_CRATES_UPDATE
are updated.
.Ev MODCARGO_RUSTFLAGS
can be used to pass custom flags to all
.Xr rustc 1
invocations.
.Pp
.Pa lang/rust ,
.Pa devel/cargo
and
.Pa devel/cargo-generate-vendor
are added to
.Ev BUILD_DEPENDS .
By default
.Ev MASTER_SITES9
is used to download the crates.
.Pp
This module defines:
.Bl -tag -width MODCARGO_CRATES_UPDATE
.It MODCARGO_CARGOTOML
Path to cargo manifest.
Defaults to
.Pa ${WRKSRC}/Cargo.toml .
.It MODCARGO_CRATES
Crates that will be downloaded by the module.
.It MODCARGO_CRATES_UPDATE
List of crates to update, overriding the version listed in Cargo.lock.
.It MODCARGO_FEATURES
List of features to be used when building.
.It MODCARGO_VENDOR_DIR
Name of the local directory for vendoring crates.
Defaults to
.Pa ${WRKSRC}/modcargo-crates .
.El
.Pp
This module adds three
.Xr make 1
targets:
.Bl -tag -width modcargo-gen-crates-licenses
.It Cm modcargo-metadata
Rerun the generation of crates' metadata.
.It Cm modcargo-gen-crates
Generate the
.Ev MODCARGO_CRATES
list from Cargo.lock (a preliminary crates list is not required).
.It Cm modcargo-gen-crates-licenses
Generate the
.Ev MODCARGO_CRATES
list with license information from crates present in the
.Ev MODCARGO_VENDOR_DIR
directory.
