.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file contains lines which specify how the permissions and
ownership of various system files should be changed based on
the user's login device name.

Blank lines or lines with only a comment are ignored.

The final field is a ":"-delimited list of devices, e.g.

.Pp
The

file is used by

the files once again belonging to root.
