ownership of various system files should be changed based on
the user's login device name.

Blank lines or lines with only a comment are ignored.

.Pp
The
.Nm fbtab
file is used by
.Xr login 1
to

the specified files to the user who has performed a login.  As well,

the files once again belonging to root.
