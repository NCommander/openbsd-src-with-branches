.Dt RC 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rc
.Nd command script for auto\-reboot and daemons
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rc
.Nm rc.local
.Nm rc.securelevel
.Nm netstart
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm rc
is the command script that is invoked by
.Xr init 8
during an automatic reboot and after single user mode is exited;
it performs system housekeeping chores and starts up system daemons.
.Nm rc.local 
is the script holding commands which are pertinent only
to a specific site.
.Nm rc.securelevel
is the script which runs commands that must be run before the
security level changes.
.Nm netstart
is the script which commands and daemons pertaining to the network.
All of these are controlled in part by
.Xr rc.conf 8
which specifies which daemons and services are to be run.
.Pp
When an automatic reboot is in progress,
.Nm rc
is invoked with the argument
.Em autoboot .
The first portion of
.Nm rc
runs an
.Xr fsck 8
with option
.Fl p
to ``preen'' all the disks of minor inconsistencies resulting
from the last system shutdown and to check for serious inconsistencies
caused by hardware or software failure.
If this auto-check and repair succeeds, then the second part of
.Nm rc
is run.
.Pp
The second part of
.Nm rc ,
which is run after an auto-reboot succeeds and also if
.Nm rc
is invoked when a single user shell terminates (see
.Xr init 8 ) ,
and then mounts filesystems, starts system daemons, preserves editor files,
clears the scratch directory
.Pa /tmp ,
and saves any possible core image that might have been
generated as a result of a system crash, with
.Xr savecore 8 .
.Pp
.Nm netstart
is executed by
.Nm rc
before the system daemons are run.
.Nm netstart
defines the machine's name, configures any network interfaces,
initializes the routing table, and optionally, starts the ip filter
daemon.
.Pp
.Nm rc.local
is executed towards the end of
.Nm rc
(it is not the very last as there are a few services that must be
the started at the very end).
Normally,
.Nm rc.local
contains commands and daemons that are not part of the
stock installation.
.Pp
.Nm rc.securelevel
is executed by
.Nm rc
to start daemons that must run before the security level changes.
It then sets the security level to the values specified in
.Xr rc.conf 8 .
.Pp
Following tradition, the startup files
.Nm rc ,
.Nm rc.local ,
.Nm rc.securelevel ,
and
.Nm netstart
reside in
.Pa /etc .
