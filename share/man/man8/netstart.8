.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm netstart
.Nd command script for network startup
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /etc/netstart
.Op Ar interface ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the command script that is invoked by
.Xr rc 8
during an automatic reboot and after single user mode is exited;
it performs network initialization.
.Pp
The
.Nm
script can also be used to start newly created bridges or interfaces,
or reset existing interfaces to their default state.
The behaviour of this script is (or can be) controlled to some
extent by variables defined in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf ,
which specifies which daemons and services are to be run.
.Pp
During the system boot,
.Nm
is executed.
.Nm
performs the following operations, in the sequence given:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact -offset indent
.It
Set the machine's name.
.It
Configure the loopback interface.
.It
Configure all the physical interfaces.
.It
Configure the following non-physical interfaces:
.Xr trunk 4 ,
.Xr vlan 4 ,
.Xr pfsync 4 ,
and
.Xr carp 4 .
.It
Initialize the routing table and set up the default routes.
.It
Configure the remaining non-physical interfaces:
.Xr pppoe 4 ,
.Xr gif 4 ,
and
.Xr gre 4 .
.It
Configure all
.Xr bridge 4
interfaces.
.El
.Pp
After the system is completely initialized, it is possible to start a
newly created interface or
.Xr bridge 4 ,
or reset an existing interface to its default state, by invoking
the following, where
.Ar foo0
is the interface or bridge name:
.Pp
.D1 # sh /etc/netstart foo0
.Sh MULTICAST ROUTING
To enable
.Xr multicast 4
routing, the
.Va net.inet.ip.mforwarding
and/or
.Va net.inet6.ip6.mforwarding
.Xr sysctl 8
variables should be set to 1.
Routing to the 224.0.0.0/4 net is set up using values from
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
according to these rules:
.Bl -bullet
.It
The default.
If the multicast settings are as follows
then multicast routing will not be enabled.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
multicast_host=NO
multicast_router=NO
.Ed
.It
If the multicast settings are as follows
then multicast routing will be enabled,
but no multicast route will be set up.
It is expected that a routing daemon, such as
.Xr mrouted 8 ,
will be started as well.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
multicast_host=NO
multicast_router=YES
.Ed
.It
If the multicast settings are as follows
then multicast routing will be enabled,
using the default interface,
or the interface name specified by
.Va multicast_host .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
multicast_host=YES
multicast_router=NO
.Ed
or:
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
multicast_host=foo0	# interface name
multicast_router=NO
.Ed
.It
Other cases are configuration errors and will cause multicast routing not to be
enabled.

command first appeared in
