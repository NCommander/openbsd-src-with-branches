.Dt NETSTART 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm netstart
.Nd command scripts for network startup
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /etc/netstart
.Op interface ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm netstart
is the command script that is invoked by
.Xr rc 8
during an automatic reboot and after single user mode is exited;
it performs network initialization.
.Pp
The
.Nm netstart
script can also be used to start newly-created bridges or interfaces,
or reset existing interfaces to their default state.
The behaviour of this script is (or can be) controlled to some
extent by variables defined in
.Nm rc.conf ,
which specifies which daemons and services are to be run.
.Pp
During the system boot,
.Nm 
is executed.
.Nm netstart
will perform the following operations:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Set the machine's name.
.It
Configure the loopback interface.
.It
Configure all the physical interfaces.
.It
Initialize the routing table and setup the default routes.
.It
Configure all the
.Xr gif 4
and
.Xr gre 4
interfaces.
.It
Configure all the bridges.
.El
.Pp
After the system is completely initialized, it is possible to start a
newly-created interface or
.Xr bridge 4 ,
or reset an existing interface to its default state, by invoking
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
sh /etc/netstart foo0
.Ed
where
.Ar foo0
is the interface or bridge name.
.Sh MULTICAST ROUTING
Routing to the 224.0.0.0/4 net is setup using values from
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
according to these rules:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
If the multicast settings are as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
multicast_host=NO
multicast_router=NO
.Ed
then multicast routing will not be enabled.
.It
If the multicast settings are as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
multicast_host=NO
multicast_router=YES
.Ed
then multicast routing will be enabled, but no multicast route will be set up.
It is expected that a routing daemon, such as
.Xr mrouted 8 ,
will be started as well.
.It
If the multicast settings are as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
multicast_host=YES
multicast_router=NO
.Ed
or:
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
multicast_host=foo0	# interface name
multicast_router=NO
.Ed
then multicast routing will be enabled, using the default interface,
or the interface name specified by
.Va multicast_host .
.It
Other cases are configuration errors and will cause multicast routing not to be
enabled.
