.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm autoinstall
.Nd unattended OpenBSD installation and upgrade
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
allows unattended installation or upgrade of netbooted
.Ox
machines by automatically answering installer questions read from
a response file.
The information whether to install or upgrade and where to get the
response file from is obtained via DHCP.
The response file is downloaded from an HTTP server.
.Pp
The DHCP parameter
.Ql filename
controls the
.Nm
mode and has to contain either
.Ql auto_install
or
.Ql auto_upgrade .
On architectures where this parameter is used for netbooting, create
a symbolic link from the boot program to auto_install and/or
auto_upgrade.
The DHCP parameter
.Ql next-server
contains the IP address of the HTTP server.
Optionally, the DHCP parameter
.Ql host-name
is used to configure the hostname.
.Pp
Valid response file names are
.Ql install.conf ,
.Ql MAC-install.conf ,
.Ql upgrade.conf
and
.Ql MAC-upgrade.conf .
The MAC address of the netboot interface, in lowercase hex notation, can be
used to provide machine-specific response files, which have precedence.
The response files are fetched from the
.Ql DocumentRoot
of the HTTP server.
.Pp
The format of a response file is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
question = answer
.Ed
.Pp
.Ql question
is an installer question (up to the question mark) or a non-ambiguous
part of it, consisting of whitespace separated words.
.Ql answer
is the answer to the question.
Passwords may be in plaintext, encrypted with
.Xr encrypt 1 ,
or set to
.Ql *************
to disable password logins, only permitting alternative access methods
(for example,
.Xr ssh 1
keys).
.Pp
If
.Nm
does not find an answer in the response file, the default answer as
provided by the installer is used.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/dhcpd.confXXX" -compact
.It Pa /etc/dhcpd.conf
dhcpd(8) configuration file
.It Pa install.conf
response file for unattended installation
.It Pa upgrade.conf
response file for unattended upgrade
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
A typical install.conf file will look something like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
System hostname = server1
Password for root = $2a$14$Z4xRMg8vDpgYH...GVot3ySoj8yby
Change the default console to com0 = yes
Which speed should com0 use = 19200
Setup a user = puffy
Password for user = *************
Public ssh key for user = ssh-rsa AAAAB3...RVtZJL puffy@ai
What timezone are you in = Europe/Stockholm
Location of sets = http
Server = ftp.eu.openbsd.org
.Ed
.Pp
It can be also used for upgrades by creating a symbolic link to
upgrade.conf.
.Pp
And an example
.Xr dhcpd.conf 5
host entry:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
host foo {
  hardware ethernet 00:50:60:49:8b:84;
  fixed-address 192.168.2.180;
  filename "auto_install";
  option host-name "foo";
}
