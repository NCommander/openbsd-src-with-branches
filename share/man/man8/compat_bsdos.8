.Sh NAME
.Nm compat_bsdos
.Nd setup procedure for running BSD/OS binaries under emulation
.Sh DESCRIPTION
OpenBSD supports the execution of BSD/OS binaries; most binaries should
work, at least from the BSD/OS 2.1 era.  Some things that are not currently
supported are proprietary extensions made to the BSD/OS kernel.
.Pp
To activate the BSD/OS compatibility feature, the kernel must be compiled
with the
.Nm COMPAT_BSDOS
option enabled.
.Pp
.Nm COMPAT_BSDOS
follows the standard
.Dq emul
filesystem scheme, using
.Pa /emul/bsdos
as the prefix.  This means that all BSD/OS executables first look in
.Pa /emul/bsdos
whenever opening a file; configuration information, shared library images,
etc., for BSD/OS binaries should all be installed under the emulation
directory in order to avoid conflicts with native files.
.Pp
Although many commercial BSD/OS binaries are
.Dq pure
(in that they need no shared libraries), system binaries and those
compiled/linked with the
BSD/OS
.\" no .Xr here because we don't have junk like shlicc.
.Nm shlicc
program require the appropriate shared library images.  These may be
found in the
.Pa /shlib
directory on a BSD/OS system, and must be copied to
.Pa /emul/bsdos/shlib
in order for such binaries to work.  The user is responsible for having
the appropriate BSD/OS licenses in order to use the shared library images.
.Sh BUGS
If BSDi ever manages to port their system to more architectures or switch
to real dynamically linked libraries these instructions may have to change.
.Pp
.Nm COMPAT_BSDOS
is currently only supported on the i386.
