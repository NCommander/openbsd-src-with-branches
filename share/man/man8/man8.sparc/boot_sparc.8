.Tn sparc-specific
system bootstrapping procedures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Power fail and crash recovery
Normally, the system will reboot itself at power-up or after crashes.
An automatic consistency check of the file systems will be performed
(as described in
.Xr fsck 8 ) ,
and unless this fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.
.Pp
.Ss Cold starts
System boot blocks are installed near the start of the boot disk
using the procedure described in
.Xr installboot 8 .
The boot program attempts to load
.Pa bsd
from partition
.Dq a
of the boot device,
which must currently be an
.Dq sd
disk.
.Pp
The
.Fl s
flag to the bootloader will bring the system up in single-user mode.
The
.Fl a
flag instructs the system to prompt for the location of the root filesystem
and the primary swap partition.
Other flags are currently ignored.
.Pp
The SPARC boot ROM comes in two flavours: an
.Dq old-style
ROM is used in
sun4 machines, while a
.Dq new-style
ROM can be found on sun4c and sun4m models.
The
.Dq new-style
SPARC boot ROM is a full-featured Forth system with emacs
key bindings.
It can be put in
.Dq old-style
user-interface compatibility
mode (in which case it shows a simple
.Dq \&>
prompt), but this is essentially
useless.
However, by default the ROM runs in old-mode; to enter new-mode type
.Dq n .
The ROM then shows a Forth-style
.Dq ok
prompt.
It is recommended to have the ROM always start in its native
.Dq new-style
mode.
Utter the following
incantation in new-mode to force the ROM to always start in new-mode:
.Pp
.Em \	ok
setenv sunmon-compat? false
.Pp
The ROM will normally load the kernel from
.Dq sd(0,0,0)bsd .
To change the
default so that
.Ox
will be loaded, type the following:
.Pp
.Em \	ok
setenv boot-from sd(0,0,0)bsd
.Pp
If the
.Xr sysctl 8
variable
.Ev ddb.console
is enabled, at any time you can break back to the ROM by pressing the
.Dq L1
and
.Dq a
keys at the same time (if the console is a serial port the same is
achieved by sending a
.Dq break ) .
If you do this accidentally you can continue whatever was in progress
by typing
.Dq go .
