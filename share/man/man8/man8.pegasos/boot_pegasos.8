.Dt BOOT_PEGASOS 8 pegasos
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm boot_pegasos
.Nd Pegasos system bootstrapping procedures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss System startup
When powered on, after a panic, or if the system is rebooted via
.Xr reboot 8
or
.Xr shutdown 8 ,
the
.Tn Open Firmware
will proceed to its initialization, and will boot an operating system
if the
.Em auto-boot?\&
variable is set to
.Dq true ,
or will wait for interactive commands otherwise.
.Ss Boot process description
The Pegasos OpenFirmware will normally load a secondary bootloader program
from the device and filename as instructed by the
.Em boot-device
and
.Em boot-file
variables.
To boot
.Ox ,
.Em boot-device
should be set to
.Dq ofwboot ,
while
.Em boot-device
should point to the
.Ox
partition, usually
.Dq hd:3
to refer to the last partition of the first hard drive.
.Ss Boot process options
The
.Ox
bootloader will look for a kernel named
.Pa bsd
by default.
A different kernel name, as well as kernel options, can be specified as
parameters to
.Pa ofwboot ,
when booting manually with the
.Em boot
command, such as in:
.Pp
\	boot hd:3 ofwboot obsd -s
.Pp
The following options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width "-XXX" -offset indent -compact
.Pp
.It Fl a
Prompt for the root filesystem and swap devices after the devices have
been configured.
.It Fl c
Enter the
.Dq User Kernel Config
mode upon startup
.Pq see Xr boot_config 8 .
.It Fl d
Enter the debugger,
.Xr ddb 4 ,
as soon as the kernel console has been initialized.
.It Fl s
Boot the system single-user.
The system will be booted multi-user unless this option is specified.
.El
.Ss Abnormal system termination
In case of system crashes, the kernel will usually enter the kernel
debugger,
.Xr ddb 4 ,
unless it is not present in the kernel, or it is disabled via the
.Em ddb.panic
sysctl.
Upon leaving ddb, or if ddb was not entered, the kernel will halt the system
if it was still in device configuration phase, or attempt a dump to the
configured dump device, if possible.
The crash dump will then be recovered by
.Xr savecore 8
during the next multi-user boot cycle.
It is also possible to force other behaviours from ddb.
.Ss Accessing OpenFirmware
If the
.Em auto-boot?\&
variable is set to
.Dq true ,
the boot process can be aborted by pressing the escape key during the
first few seconds of the firmware initialization.
