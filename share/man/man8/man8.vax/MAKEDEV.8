.Sh NAME
MAKEDEV \- create system and device special files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm MAKEDEV
.Ar name
.Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The shell script
.Nm MAKEDEV ,
found in the
.Pa /dev
directory, is used to create the common special
files.
See
.Xr special 8
for a more complete discussion of special files.
.Pp
.Nm MAKEDEV
takes any number of device names as arguments, where the names are
the common abbreviation for the device.
There are three special device names,
.Ar all ,
.Ar std ,
and
.Ar local .
.Ar All
creates device files for all devices on the VAX. If units are expected for
a device,
.Nm MAKEDEV
supplies the standard numbers. The
.Ar std
argument creates the standard devices for the VAX.  Finally, the
.Ar local
argument is for devices specific to the local site, and executes the
shell file
.Pa MAKEDEV.local .
.Pp
The VAX supports the following devices.
Where a device name is followed by a hash sign (``#''), the hash sign
must be replaced by a unit number.
