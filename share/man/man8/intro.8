.Sh NAME
.Nm intro
.Nd introduction to system maintenance and operation commands
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The manual pages in section 8 contain information related to
system operation and maintenance.
They describe commands concerning file systems,
such as
.Xr edquota 8 ,
.Xr fsck 8 ,
.Xr mount 8 ,
and
.Xr newfs 8 .
They also cover commands concerning system backup/recovery, such as
.Xr dump 8
and
.Xr restore 8 .
.Pp
There are pages which document the running of the system, such as
.Xr afterboot 8 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,
.Xr security 8 ,
and the configuration files located in
.Pa /etc .
Procedures concerning system failure are documented in
.Xr crash 8 .
.Pp
Section 8 pages also describe network services and daemons.
The rest of this page discusses some of the main daemons
available on the
.Ox
system,
and how to enable/disable them.
.Pp
System daemons are controlled by the script
.Xr rc 8 ,
which is in turn configured by
.Xr rc.conf 8 .
For example the HTTP daemon
.Xr httpd 8
is controlled by the following line from
.Xr rc.conf 8 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Dl httpd_flags=NO
.Ed
.Pp
Thus it is not started by default.
To enable or disable daemon processes,
administrators should edit the file
.Xr rc.conf.local 8 ,
which overrides
.Xr rc.conf 8 .
So to enable
.Xr httpd 8 ,
the following line might be added to
.Pa /etc/rc.conf.local :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
httpd_flags=""
.Ed
or
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
httpd_flags="-DSSL"
.Ed
.Pp
As can be seen above,
this method is also used to specify additional options.
.Pp
Below is a list of some of the daemons available.
For further information, see
.Xr rc 8
and the individual pages for the utilities.
.Ss Apache web server (HTTP)
The apache web server,
.Xr httpd 8 .
On
.Ox ,
it will
.Xr chroot 2
to the
.Dq ServerRoot
path.
Detailed information is available in
.Pa /usr/share/doc/html/httpd/ .
.Pp
Relevant
.Xr rc.conf 8
variables:
.Va httpd_flags .
.Ss Automounter daemon (amd)
If using the
.Xr amd 8
package,
go into the
.Pa /etc/amd
directory and set it up by
renaming
.Pa master.sample
to
.Pa master
and editing it and creating other maps as needed.
Alternatively, you can get your maps with YP.
.Pp
Relevant
.Xr rc.conf 8
variables:
.Va amd ,
.Va amd_dir ,
and
.Va amd_master .
.Ss BIND name server (DNS)
If you are using the BIND name server, check the
.Pa /etc/resolv.conf
file.
It may look something like:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
domain nts.umn.edu
nameserver 128.101.101.101
nameserver 134.84.84.84
search nts.umn.edu. umn.edu.
lookup file bind
.Ed
.Pp
If using a caching name server, add the line "nameserver 127.0.0.1" first.
.Pp
Relevant
.Xr rc.conf 8
variables:
.Va named_flags .
.Ss Clock synchronisation
In order to make sure the system clock is correct,
it may be synchronised with a number of external sources.
The utilities available are:
.Xr ntpd 8 ,
.Xr rdate 8 ,
and
.Xr timed 8 .
.Pp
Relevant
.Xr rc.conf 8
variables:
.Va ntpd_flags ,
.Va rdate_flags ,
and
.Va timed_flags .
.Ss Concatenated disks (ccd)
If you are using
.Xr ccd 4
concatenated disks, edit
.Pa /etc/ccd.conf .
Use the
.Ic ccdconfig -U
command to unload and the
.Ic ccdconfig -C
command to create tables internal to the kernel for the concatenated disks.
You then
.Xr mount 8 ,
.Xr umount 8 ,
and edit
.Pa /etc/fstab
as needed.
.Ss BOOTP/DHCP server
If this is a
BOOTP or DHCP
server, edit
.Pa /etc/dhcpd.conf
as needed.
See also
.Xr diskless 8 .
.Pp
Relevant
.Xr rc.conf 8
variables:
.Va bootparamd_flags ,
.Va dhcpd_flags ,
and
.Va dhcrelay_flags .
.Ss HP remote boot server
Edit
.Pa /etc/rbootd.conf
if needed for remote booting.
If you do not have HP computers doing remote booting, do not enable this.
See also
.Xr diskless 8 .
.Pp
Relevant
.Xr rc.conf 8
variables:
.Va rbootd_flags .
.Ss Kerberos
If you are going to use
.Xr kerberos 8
for authentication, and you already have a
Kerberos
master, change directory to
.Pa /etc/kerberosV
and configure.
Remember to get a
.Pa srvtab
from the master so that the remote commands work.
.Pp
Relevant
.Xr rc.conf 8
variables:
.Va krb5_master_kdc
and
.Va krb5_slave_kdc .
.Ss NFS server
If this is an NFS server,
edit
.Pa /etc/exports .
.Pp
Relevant
.Xr rc.conf 8
variables:
.Va nfs_server
and
.Va nfsd_flags .
.Ss Relay Daemon
A relay daemon,
.Xr relayd 8 ,
able to run as a
load-balancer, application layer gateway, or transparent proxy.
.Pp
Relevant
.Xr rc.conf 8
variables:
.Va relayd_flags .
.Ss Routing Daemons
Various daemons for managing routing tables are available:
.Xr bgpd 8 ,
.Xr ospfd 8 ,
and
.Xr ripd 8 .
.Pp
Relevant
.Xr rc.conf 8
variables:
.Va bgpd_flags ,
.Va ospfd_flags ,
and
.Va ripd_flags .
.Ss RPC-based network services
Several services depend on the RPC portmapper,
.Xr portmap 8 ,
being running for proper operation.
This includes YP and NFS exports, among other services.
.Pp
Relevant
.Xr rc.conf 8
variables:
.Va portmap .
.Ss YP setup
Check the YP domain name with the
.Xr domainname 1
command.
If necessary, correct it by editing the
.Pa /etc/defaultdomain
file (see
.Xr defaultdomain 5 ) .
The
.Pa /etc/netstart
script reads this file on boot to determine and set the domain name.
You may also set the running system's domain name with the
.Xr domainname 1
command.
To start YP client services, simply run
.Ic ypbind ,
then perform the remaining
YP activation as described in
.Xr passwd 5
and
.Xr group 5 .
.Pp
In particular, to enable YP passwd support, you'll need to add the following
line to
.Pa /etc/master.passwd :
.Pp
.Dl +:*::::::::
.Pp
You do this by using
.Xr vipw 8 .
.Pp
There are many more YP man pages available to help you.
You can find more information by starting with
.Xr yp 8 .
