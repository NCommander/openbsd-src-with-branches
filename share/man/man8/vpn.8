.Dt VPN 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm vpn
.Nd configuring the system for virtual private networks
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A virtual private network is used to connect two or more subnets via the
internet. For each subnet there is a security gateway which is connected
via a cryptographically secured tunnel to the security gateway of the other
subnet. In
.Ox
.Xr ipsec 4
is used to provide the necessary cryptographical services. This document
describes the configuration process for setting up a 
.Nm VPN .
.Pp
Both subnets need to configure
.Xr ipsec 4
routes with the 
.Xr ipsecadm 1 
tool:
.Pp
On the security gateway of subnet A:
.Bd -literal
ipsecadm flow -dst gatewB -spi 1 -addr netA netAmask netB netBmask -local
.Ed
.Pp
and on the security gateway of subnet B:
.Bd -literal
ipsecadm flow -dst gatewA -spi 1 -addr netB netBmask netA netAmask -local
.Ed
.Pp
Additionally both security gateways need to start the
.Xr photurisd 8
key management daemon with the
.Fl v
flag and have to make sure that it is configured properly on both sides to 
provide encryption and authentication.
.Pp
Now
.Xr ipf 1
needs to be configured that all packets from the outside are blocked.
Only packets from the security gateways either on the
.Pa enc0
interface or 
.Tn UDP
packets with source and remote ports of 468
should be allowed in.
.Pp 
The ipf rules for a tunnel which only uses ESP on security gateway A 
might look like this:
.Bd -literal
# ed0 is the only interface going to the outside.
block in log on ed0 from any to any
block out log on ed0 from any to any
block in log on enc0 from any to any

# Passing in encrypted traffic from security gateways
pass in proto sipp-esp from gatewB to gatewA
pass out proto sipp-esp from gatewA to gatewB

# Passing in traffic from the designated subnets.
pass in on enc0 from netB/netBmask to netA/netAmask

# Passing in Photuris traffic from the security gateways
pass in on ed0 proto udp from gatewB/32 port = 468 to gatewA/32 port = 468
pass out on ed0 proto udp from gatewA/32 port = 468 to gatewB/32 port = 468
.Ed
.Pp
If there are no more ipf rules the quick clause can be added to the last
three rules.
