the common abbreviation for the device.
There are three special device names,
.Ar all ,

and
.Ar local .
If
given,
.Ar all
creates device files for all devices on the mvme68k.
If units are expected for a device,
.Nm MAKEDEV
will supply the standard numbers.
The
.Ar std
argument creates only the standard devices for the mvme68k.
Finally
.Ar local
is for devices specific to the local site, and executes the shell file
.Pa MAKEDEV.local .
