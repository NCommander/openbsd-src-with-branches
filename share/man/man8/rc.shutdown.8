.Sh NAME
.Nm /etc/rc.shutdown
.Nd command script run at system shutdown
.Sh DESCRIPTION
When the system is administratively shut down using either the
.Xr reboot 8
or
.Xr halt 8
command, either of these programs checks for the existence of a
.Pa /etc/rc.shutdown
script to run before halting the system. It will also be executed by
.Xr init 8
if a keyboard-requested halt is issued (for architectures that support this).
.Pp
Currently, the
.Nm
script does nothing but save part of the entropy pool for reuse on reboot, but
extra commands may be added by the system administrator.
