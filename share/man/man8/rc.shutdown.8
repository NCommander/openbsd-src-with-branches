.Dt RC.SHUTDOWN 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm /etc/rc.shutdown
.Nd command script run at system shutdown
.Sh DESCRIPTION
When the system is administratively shut down using either the
.Xr reboot 8
or
.Xr halt 8
command, either of these programs checks for the existence of a
.Pa /etc/rc.shutdown
script to run before halting the system.
It will also be executed by
.Xr init 8
if a keyboard-requested halt is issued (for architectures that support this).
.Pp
The
.Nm
script, like
.Xr rc.local 8 ,
is entirely for commands added by the system administrator.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr halt 8 ,
.Xr init 8 ,
.Xr rc 8 ,
.Xr reboot 8
