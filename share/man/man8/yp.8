.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm YP
subsystem allows network management of passwd and group file
entries through the functions
.Xr getpwent 3
and
.Xr getgrent 3 .
.Nm YP
also provides hooks for other client programs, such as
.Xr amd 8
and
.Xr bootparamd 8 ,
that can use
.Nm YP
maps.
.Pp
The
.Nm YP 
subsystem is started automatically in
.Pa /etc/rc
if the directory
.Pa /var/yp
exists.
.Sh BUGS
Only
.Nm YP
client functionality exists, there is no ypserv (yet).
.Pp
If
.Xr ypbind
cannot find a server, the system behaves the same way as Sun's code:
it hangs.

.Sh HISTORY
This free
.Nm YP
subsystem was written from scratch by Theo de Raadt to be compatible
to Sun's implementation.
