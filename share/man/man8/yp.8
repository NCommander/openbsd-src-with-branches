.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm YP
subsystem allows network management of passwd, group, and
hosts file entries through the functions
.Xr getpwent 3 ,
.Xr getgrent 3
and
.Xr gethostbyname 3
(as well as number of other databases and functions).
.Nm YP
also provides hooks for numerous other client programs
such as
.Xr amd 8
and
.Xr bootparamd 8
to access distributed and shareable versions
of their maps through
.Nm YP .
.Pp
The
.Nm YP
client subsystem is started automatically in
.Pa /etc/rc
if the directory
.Pa /var/yp/binding
exists.
The client subsystem can be turned on and off by creating or
deleting that directory.
.Xr ypbind 8
will create that directory if run by hand.
.Pp
The
.Nm YP
server subsystem is started automatically in
.Pa /etc/rc
if the directory
.Pa /var/yp/DOMAINNAME
exists.
This directory is automatically created by
.Xr ypinit 8
(which initializes the machine as a
.Nm YP
server.)
.Pp
If
.Nm ypbind
cannot find a server, the system behaves the same way as Sun's code
does: it hangs.

.Sh HISTORY
This free
.Nm YP
subsystem is thought to be compatible with Sun's implementation.
.Pp
The ypbind, library components, and userland programs were implemented
by Theo de Raadt <deraadt@theos.com>.
The server component was implemented by Mats O Jansson <moj@stacken.kth.se>.
