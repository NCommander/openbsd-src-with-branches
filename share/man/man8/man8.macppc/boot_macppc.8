.Tn macppc-specific
system bootstrapping procedures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Power fail and crash recovery
Normally, the system will reboot itself at power-up or after crashes.
An automatic consistency check of the file systems will be performed
(as described in
.Xr fsck 8 ) ,
and unless this fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.
.Ss Cold starts
System boot blocks are installed either in a HFS partition or in a
MSDOS partition on the disk. If MBR partitioning is chosen for
the disk, the boot block will be installed automatically, for
HFS shared disks, the
.Dq ofwboot
program must be installed manually.
The ofwboot program can be loaded from any openfirmware recognized 
disk or network device.
.Pp
The
.Fl s
flag to the bootloader will bring the system up in single-user mode.
The
.Fl a
flag instructs the system to prompt for the location of the root filesystem
and the primary swap partition.
The
.Fl c
flag instructs the system to enter the
.Dq User Kernel Config
mode upon startup (see
.Xr boot_config 8 ).
Other flags are currently ignored.
.Pp
The Apple OpenFirmware will normally load the kernel from the device and
filename as instructed by the
.Dq boot-device
and
.Dq boot-file
variables.
If the
.Dq boot-file
variable is empty, the
.Ox
bootloader will look for a kernel named
.Dq bsd ,
unless a different filename has been specified in the boot command.
To reset this variable to its default, empty, value, type the following:
.Pp
.Em \	ok
set-default boot-device
.Ss Accessing the PROM
The prom can only be accessed during system reset, or at power-up.
To enter OpenFirmware, press and hold 
.Dq Cntrl
.Dq Cmd
.Dq o
.Dq f
as the machine resets until it enters the openfirmware debugger.
