.Dt BOOT_HPPA64 8 hppa64
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm boot_hppa64
.Nd hppa64 system bootstrapping procedures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss System starts
When powered on, after a panic, or if the system is rebooted via
.Xr reboot 8
or
.Xr shutdown 8 ,
the hppa firmware
.Pq Dq PDC
will proceed to its initialization, and will boot an operating system
if autoboot is enabled.
.\"
.Ss Boot process description
System boot blocks are provided as a
.Dq LIF
.Pq Logical Interchange Format
archive, either on a disk, tape or CD-ROM device,
or via the network, using the
.Em bootp
protocol.
A small
.Xr mkboot 8
utility
is provided for combining primary boot and a number
of images (OS kernels or standalone binaries)
into one
.Dq LIF
volume suitable for booting.
.Ss PDC concepts
If autoboot is enabled, the PDC will attempt to boot from the specified
.Dq boot path
value.
If no
.Dq boot path
has been specified, the PDC will then scan for bootable devices and
boot from the first found, after a few seconds allowing the user to
interrupt the boot process.
If autoboot is disabled, the PDC will enter interactive mode, after an
optional device scan.
In all cases, it is possible to enter interactive mode by holding the
escape key during the selftests, or when prompted to do so to abort
the current operation, unless the PDC has been configured in
.Dq secure mode .
.\"
.Ss ISL interaction
.Dq ISL
stands for
.Dq Initial System Loader
and is the
.Xr boot 8
program in
.Ox .
On all versions of the PDC the
.Dq boot
command (see below) will be followed by the question:
.Dq Interact with IPL (Y, N, or Cancel)?>
where a positive answer will invoke an interactive prompt in the
.Xr boot 8
program later and negative will thus suppress it.
A cancellation will abort the boot process.
.Pp
With the default behaviour being a non-interactive boot process.
.\"
.Ss PDC operation
There is only one interactive mode, with a
.Em BOOT_ADMIN>
prompt, which provides both boot settings and commands.
The complete list of commands depends on the machine and PDC version.
The following list only mentions commands impacting the boot process.
.Bl -tag -width auto\ search -offset indent
.It Ic auto boot
Displays or changes the autoboot setting.
If
.Ic auto boot
is set to
.Dq on ,
the PDC will always attempt to boot.
The booted device chosen will depend on the
.Ic auto search
setting.
.It Ic auto search
Displays or changes the device scan setting.
If
.Ic auto search
is set to
.Dq on ,
the PDC will attempt to boot the first bootable device found in
this order:
.Bl -enum -offset indent -compact
.It
Boot device
.Em path
setting.
.It
.Tn SCSI
devices connected to the built-in
.Tn SCSI
controller,
the highest ID numbers being preferred.
.It
Network
.Em bootp
server (see also
.Xr dhcpd 8 ) .
.It
Other
.Tn SCSI
devices connected to secondary controllers,
the highest ID numbers being preferred.
.El
If
.Ic auto search
is set to
.Dq off
and the primary boot path points to a bootable device,
no device scan will occur.
.Pp
Note that setting
.Ic auto search
to
.Dq on
will force autoboot, regardless of the
.Ic auto boot
value.
.It Ic boot
Boots off the specified device.
The
.Dq primary
and
.Dq alternate
path settings may be booted with
.Ic boot Ar pri
and
.Ic boot Ar alt
respectively.
.It Ic path
Displays or changes the boot and console devices.
The boot device is defined as the
.Dq primary
path, and another setting may be stored as the
.Dq alternate
path for rescue purposes.
For example, to define the primary boot path to the
.Tn SCSI
disk with ID 5 connected to the built-in controller, one would enter
.Ic path pri Ar scsi.5 .
.Pp
When invoked without parameters,
.Ic path
will list the various path settings.
.El
.\"
.Ss Boot process options
The
.Ox
hppa boot loader program is extensively described in a separate document,
.Xr boot 8 .
.Ss Abnormal system termination
If the system crashes, it will enter the kernel debugger,
.Xr ddb 4 ,
if it is configured in the kernel.
If the crash occurred during
initialization and the debugger is not present or is exited, the
kernel will halt the system.
If the crash occurred during normal operation and the debugger
is not present or is exited, the system will attempt a dump to the
configured dump device (which will be automatically recovered with
.Xr savecore 8
during the next multi-user boot cycle), and after the dump is complete
(successful or not) the kernel will attempt a reboot.
