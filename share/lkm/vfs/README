1.0	Overview

	This is the README file for the sample loaded file system.


2.0	Preparation

	To use this module, you must have a kernel the does *NOT*
	have an existing "kernfs" file system in it.  To determine
	if your system has the "kernfs" file system in it, check
	the build file for your kernel (usually this file is named
	"/sys/i386/conf/GENERICISA") for the following:

		options		KERNFS

	By default, NetBSD has this file system compiled as part
	of the kernel; if you wish to use this example with NetBSD
	you will have to remove this "options" line and rebuild
	your kernel.


3.0	Directions

	To test the module, do the following:

		cd module
		make load

	A load message (the copyright) will be printed on the console.

	You must then add the following line to the "/etc/fstab" file:

		kernfs /kern kernfs rw 1 1

	At the root prompt, type the following:

		mkdir /kern

	Ignore the following error if it occurs:

		mkdir: /kern: File exists

	Again at the root prompt, type the following command:

		mount /kern
		cd /kern
		cat version

	This will verify that the module is working correctly.


4.0	Recovering resources

	The file system consumes 8 pages of memory when loaded; it
	can be freed up by unloading it.  To unload it, type the
	following from the directory this file is in:

		cd module
		make unload

	The file system will be unloaded by name.
