.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
communicates with the Advanced Power Management daemon,
.Xr apmd 8 ,
making requests of it for current power status or to place the system
into a suspend or stand-by state.
With no flags,
.Nm
displays the current power management state in verbose form.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl z
Put the system into suspend (deep sleep) mode.
.It Fl S
Put the system into stand-by (light sleep) mode.
.It Fl l
Display the estimated battery lifetime (in percent).
.It Fl m
Display the estimated battery lifetime (in minutes).
.It Fl b
Display the battery status.
0 means high, 1 means low, 2 means
critical, 3 means charging, 4 means absent, and 255 means unknown.
.It Fl a
Display the external charger (A/C status).
0 means disconnected, 1
means connected, 2 means backup power source, and 255 means unknown.
.It Fl v
Request more verbose description of the displayed states.
.It Fl f Ar sockname
Set the name of the socket via which to contact
.Xr apmd 8
to
.Pa sockname .
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm zzz
variant on this command is an alternative for suspending the system.
With no arguments,
.Nm zzz
places the system into suspend mode.
The command line flags serve the same purpose as for the
.Nm
variant of this command.
.Pp
This command does not wait for positive confirmation that the requested
mode has been entered; to do so would mean the command does not return
until the system resumes from its sleep state.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/apmdev -compact
.It Pa /var/run/apmdev
default Unix domain socket for communicating with
.Xr apm 8
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl f
flag may be used to specify an alternate socket name.
The protection modes on this socket govern which users may access the
APM functions.
