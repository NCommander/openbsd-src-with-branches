@section AFS

@itemize @bullet

@item Directories - UnixModeBits are ignored when the vnode is a directory.

@item Errnos are sent over the network. Like Solaris ENOTEMPTY(93) doesn't
 even map to an error on sunos4 where ENOTEMPTY is 66.

@item Mountpoints have the mode-bits 0644, if they don't they are symlinks 
(and have the mode-bits 0755).

@section Operating systems

@itemize @bullet

@item On Irix 6.5 you have to build the dirents depending on what ABI
 of the binary you are currently running.

@item . and .. need to be first in directories, this is needed since some
programs (like make) "knows" that the two first entries are . and .. and
thus can be skiped.

@item Reclen (in struct dirent) shouldn't be too large. When its
larger then the buffer used in opendir/readdir/closedir, you lose.
