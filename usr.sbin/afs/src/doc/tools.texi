@c XXX History of RX

Rx is run over UDP.

One of rxgen or ydr is used to generate stub-files, ydr is better since
it generates prototypes, too.

The current implemetation of rx it not that beautiful.

@c XXX History of LWP

LWP is a preepmtive thread package. It does it's context-switching by
creating a private stack for each thread. The heart of the package is
select(2).

The core of the package is @file{process.S}. Its currenty built with a
bourne-shell file. @file{Process.s} is preprocessed with @code{cpp} and
then given to (g)as. The magic how to build this file a portable way is
not fun.

The stack is checked for overruns in context-switches, but that is often
too late. It might be an idea to add a @cite{red zone} at the top of the
stack to be able to detect overruns.

For architectures not supported by LWP, it can be exchanged with the
pthreads pakage.
