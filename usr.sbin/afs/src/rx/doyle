In here are the two TAR files (rxbase.tar.gz, rxkad.tar.gz) that
Transarc gave me with permission to freely redistribute.. This code
was given to me by Mike Kazar and it was OK'd for release by Al Spector.

From what I understand, Rx was developed at CMU as part of a DARPA
funded research project jointly funded by IBM.  Rx was picked up by
the AFS group and then used.. So, by all rights, the Rx stack is in
the public domain because the DARPA funding requirement placed it
there... You can read the copyright in the header for the full
legalese.
