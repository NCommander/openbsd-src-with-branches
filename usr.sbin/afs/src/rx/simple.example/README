The files in this directory can be made (use make or build) into a simple system
to demonstrate a simple client and server which use the Rx RPC protocol, together with stubs generated by rxgen.

Run the server, sample_server, with no arguments, and the client, sample_client, with a single argument, the hostname where the server is running.  The client simply asks the server to add and subtract 10 different pairs of numbers, the results of which are printed out.
