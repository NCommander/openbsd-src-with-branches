# * Configuration stuff
#
# Arla uses GNU autoconf for configuration.  If you want to modify
# configure.in (or acconfig.h) you'll need autoconf 2.13 and automake
# 1.4 or later.  To re-create the configuration files, run these
# commands:

aclocal -I cf
autoheader
autoconf

# aclocal creates a file `aclocal.m4' from all the tests in the `cf'
# directory.  autoheader will create `include/config.h.in' and autoconf
# the `configure' script.
