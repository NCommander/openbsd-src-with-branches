    Release 0.36:
       Check Solaris
          SMP
	  xfs_map/xfs_getpage (check why patch doesn't work)
       Linux
          webserver (symlink loose contents)

    Release 0.35:
       MacOS X
          run-tests
          ran (find fd/vnode leek)
       Check with E people is bugs are fixed (rename of volume, ...)

   TODO-list, in no particular order.

Please mail arla-drinkers@stacken.kth.se if you want to work on
any of these things so we don't do double work.

- fix weirdness with fake mount points
  installattr (token w/o data) (ls -l ; ls foo ; ls bar)

arlad: add regular pinging of file servers

fs flushall:
-volume ?
is this really good ?

xfs/linux: 
check that we DTRT wrt Documentation/filesystem/Locking.txt

xfs/*: teach xfs to read AFS directories for readdir

xfs/linux: check if we can hook into vm_operations/address_space to
figure out when cache pages are dirty and need to flushed.

*/Makefile.in: allow creation of shared libraries

*/Makefile.in: homogenize

arlad/xfs: return from open before fetching the whole file

arlad/xfs: cache in blocks (iff ?) file too large to fit in cache ?

arlad/xfs: implement advisory locking

arlad: more improvements on writing in disconnected mode

arlad: fallback to disconnected mode if networking is not working (possibly per cell)

arlad: more consistency checks before recovering state

arlad: remove unused stuff from FCacheEntry

xfs/aix: figure out where the PAG should be stored

xfs/irix: fix syscall and implement setgroups wrapper

xfs/irix: port to Irix 6.5

xfs/solaris: verify multithreadness, merge xnode and vnode mutex locks

xfs/sunos: implement setgroups wrapper

xfs: support building as part of the kernel

OPTIMIZATIONS

This is a list of posible optimizations that could be done to different parts
of arla.

 - Delay reads and writes to cache and AFS-servers. Make the more operations
   in one batch. (possible with rx?) Especially directories don't have to be
   synced for every operation.

 - send more messages to/from arlad in one sweep. (lookup on whole path in one
   message, getattr+getdata, etc..)

MILKO

Filbunke, the nnp-class-server generation:
- callbacks
- logging
- fsck/salvage, stability, more tests
- SPEED, real i*op
- volser (?)
- pts,vldb
- security
