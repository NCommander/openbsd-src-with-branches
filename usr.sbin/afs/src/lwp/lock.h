/* The following macros allow multi statement macros to be defined safely, i.e.
   - the multi statement macro can be the object of an if statement;
   - the call to the multi statement macro may be legally followed by a semi-colon.
   BEGINMAC and ENDMAC have been tested with both the portable C compiler and
   Hi-C.  Both compilers were from the Palo Alto 4.2BSD software releases, and
   both optimized out the constant loop code.  For an example of the use
   of BEGINMAC and ENDMAC, see the definition for ReleaseWriteLock, below.
   An alternative to this, using "if(1)" for BEGINMAC is not used because it
   may generate worse code with pcc, and may generate warning messages with hi-C.
