.Sh NAME
.Nm AliasDB
.Nd add alias for an afs cell in dynroot
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm
add aliases for afs cellnames in dynroot, useful to add readwrite mountpoints
in dynroot.
.Pp
Each line in the file contains at least two elements with an optional
third element.
The first element is the cell name to make the alias for. The second
element is the alias.
The optional third element is describing properties of the
mountpoint.
.Pp
By default, an alias is a readonly mountpoint, which means that
.Nm afsd
will use readonly replicas of volumes, if they exist.
If an alias set to readwrite,
.Nm afsd
will disregard the readonly replicas and use the readwrite volumes only.
This will seriously limit performance, but maybe necessary to install
software packages etc.
.Pp
Each line that starts with a
.Sq #
is a comment
.Pp
