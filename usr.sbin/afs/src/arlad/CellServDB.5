.Sh NAME
.Nm CellServDB
.Nd AFS cells and database servers
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm
lists AFS cells known to the local AFS cache manager.
Each entry describes the name of an AFS cell and specifies the
servers for that cell.
.Pp
Here is an example of the format of an entry in the file:
.Bd -literal
>cellname               # Freetext comment describing the cell
ip-address              #first.server.for.cell
ip-address              #second.server.for.cell
ip-address              #third.server.for.cell
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
is read when 
.Nm arlad
is started, normally when the system boots.
.Pp
The text after the # is
.Em not
a comment, it the hostname of the
db-server, and it's used to lookup the address.
The address is only used when the hostname is not found in DNS.
.Pp
Entires in the file are searched and expanded by many programs.
.Pp
In most cases it is better to distribute the information in
.Nm
with the AFSDB DNS resource records. This avoids having out of date
information in
.Nm Ns .
.Pp
When using AFSDB DNS resource records, entries entries should still
be listed, but without any hosts. This is needed for dynroot to work.
