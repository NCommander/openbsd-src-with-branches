.Ed

.Nm
umich.edu engin.umich.edu
.Sh EXIT STATUS
If any errors occur during the unlog process, the exit status of
.Nm
is 1, otherwise it is 0.
.Sh NOTES
.Nm
works by first stashing the tokens you want to \fBkeep\fP in a safe place,
then removing \fBall\fP your tokens, and then restoring the tokens that
you didn't want to get rid of. For this reason, if you use
.Nm
to remove only \fBsome\fP tokens, there will be a brief period while this
program runs during which time your current PAG will have \fBno\fP tokens.
(a so called "authentication outage") This may be problematic if a program
is running simultaneously which requires constant authenticated access to
AFS.

.Xr kauth 1 ,
.Xr klog 1 ,
.Xr tokens 1
.Sh BUGS
Arla should implement a specicial AFS \fBpioctl\fP to allow removing only
one token at a time, to prevent the aforementioned problem.
