.Dt UNLOG 1
.Os "The Arla Project"
.Sh NAME
.Nm unlog
.Nd
A program to destroy some or all of your AFS tokens
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl cell Ar cells...
.Op Ar cells...
.Op Fl help
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The following flags are supported:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Fl cell
List of cells to remove tokens from. You do not need to specify this flag;
you can execute the command simply as:
.Pp
.Nm
cellname cellname ...
.It Fl help
Prints out a help message.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Remove all tokens for cell umich.edu
.Pp
.Nm
umich.edu
.Pp
Remove all tokens for umich.edu engin.umich.edu
.Pp
.Nm
umich.edu engin.umich.edu
.Sh EXIT STATUS
If any errors occur during the unlog process, the exit status of
.Nm
is 1, otherwise it is 0.
.Sh NOTES
.Nm
works by first stashing the tokens you want to keep in a safe place,
then removing all your tokens, and then restoring the tokens that
you didn't want to get rid of.
For this reason, if you use
.Nm
to remove only some tokens, there will be a brief period while this
program runs during which time your current PAG will have no tokens,
leading to a so called "authentication outage".
This may be problematic if a program is running simultaneously which 
requires constant authenticated access to AFS.

.Xr kauth 1 ,
.Xr klog 1 ,
.Xr tokens 1
.Sh BUGS
Arla should implement a specicial AFS pioctl to allow removing only
one token at a time, to prevent the aforementioned problem.
