CURRENT STATUS:
===============

It seems to me that you can't get equivalent of changepw/kerberos thru
the kerberos server running in the KA-server.

Now I haven't found any documentation how you really get tokens from
the ka-server. If someone helps me with that, ending the program is
trivial (ahm, a least it should be).
