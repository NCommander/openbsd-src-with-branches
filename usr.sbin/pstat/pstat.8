.Sh NAME
.Nm pstat
.Nd display system data structures
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pstat
.Op Fl Tfknstv
.Op Fl M Ar core
.Op Fl N Ar system
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Pstat
displays open file entry, swap space utilization,
terminal state, and vnode data structures.
If
.Ar corefile
is given, the information is sought there, otherwise
in
.Pa /dev/kmem .
The required namelist is taken from
.Pa /netbsd
unless 
.Ar system
is specified.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl T
Prints the number of used and free slots in the several system tables
and is useful for checking to see how large system tables have become
if the system is under heavy load.
.It Fl f
Print the open file table with these headings:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It LOC
The core location of this table entry.
.It TYPE
The type of object the file table entry points to.
.It FLG
Miscellaneous state variables encoded thus:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It R
open for reading
.It W
open for writing
.It A
open for appending
.It S
shared lock present
.It X
exclusive lock present
.It I
signal pgrp when data ready
.El
.It CNT
Number of processes that know this open file.
.It MSG
Number of messages outstanding for this file.
.It DATA
The location of the vnode table entry or socket structure for this file.
.It OFFSET
The file offset (see
.Xr lseek 2 ) .
.El
.It Fl k
Use 1K-byte blocks.
.It Fl n
Print devices by major/minor number rather than by name.
.It Fl s
Print information about swap space usage on all the 
swap areas compiled into the kernel.
The first column is the device name of the partition.  The next column is
the total space available in the partition.  The 
.Ar Used
column indicates the total blocks used so far;  the 
.Ar Available
column indicates how much space is remaining on each partition.
The
.Ar Capacity
reports the percentage of space used.
.Pp
If more than one partition is configured into the system, totals for all
of the statistics will be reported in the final line of the report.
.It Fl t
Print table for terminals
with these headings:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It RAW
Number of characters in raw input queue.
.It CAN
Number of characters in canonicalized input queue.
.It OUT
Number of characters in putput queue.
.It MODE
See
.Xr tty 4 .
.It ADDR
Physical device address.
.It DEL
Number of delimiters (newlines) in canonicalized input queue.
.It COL
Calculated column position of terminal.
.It STATE
Miscellaneous state variables encoded thus:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It T
delay timeout in progress
.It W
waiting for open to complete
.It O
open
.It F
outq has been flushed during DMA
.It C
carrier is on
.It B
busy doing output
.It A
process is awaiting output
.It X
open for exclusive use
.It S
output stopped
.It H
hangup on close
.El
.It PGRP
Process group for which this is controlling terminal.
.It DISC
Line discipline; blank is old tty
OTTYDISC
or
.Ql new tty
for
NTTYDISC
or
.Ql net
for
NETLDISC
(see
.Xr bk 4 ) .
.El
.It Fl v
Print the active vnodes.  Each group of vnodes corresponding
to a particular filesystem is preceded by a two line header.  The
first line consists of the following:
.Pp
.Df I
.No *** MOUNT Em fstype from 
on
.Em on fsflags
.De
.Pp
where
.Em fstype
is one of
.Em ufs , nfs , mfs , or pc ;
.Em from
is the filesystem is mounted from;
.Em on
is the directory
the filesystem is mounted on; and
.Em fsflags
is a list
of optional flags applied to the mount (see
.Xr mount 8 ) .
.The second line is a header for the individual fields ,
the first part of which are fixed, and the second part are filesystem
type specific.  The headers common to all vnodes are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It ADDR
Location of this vnode.
.It TYP
File type.
.It VFLAG
.Pp
A list of letters representing vnode flags:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It R
\- VROOT
.It T
\- VTEXT
.It L
\- VXLOCK
.It W
\- VXWANT
.It E
\- VEXLOCK
.It S
\- VSHLOCK
.It T
\- VLWAIT
.It A
\- VALIASED
.It B
\- VBWAIT
.El
.Pp
.It USE
The number of references to this vnode.
.It HOLD
The number of I/O buffers held by this vnode.
.It FILEID
The vnode fileid.
In the case of
.Em ufs
this is the inode number.
.It IFLAG
Miscellaneous filesystem specific state variables encoded thus:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It "For ufs:"
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It L
locked
.It U
update time
.Pq Xr fs 5
must be corrected
.It A
access time must be corrected
.It W
wanted by another process (L flag is on)
.It C
changed time must be corrected
.It S
shared lock applied
.It E
exclusive lock applied
.It Z
someone waiting for a lock
.It M
contains modifications
.It R
has a rename in progress
.El
.It "For nfs:"
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It W
waiting for I/O buffer flush to complete
.It P
I/O buffers being flushed
.It M
locally modified data exists
.It E
an earlier write failed
.It X
non-cacheable lease (nqnfs)
.It O
write lease (nqnfs)
.It G
lease was evicted (nqnfs)
.El
.El
.It SIZ/RDEV

major and minor device of special file.
.El
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
.Bl -tag -width BLOCKSIZE
.It Ev BLOCKSIZE
If the environmental variable
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
is set, and the
.Fl k
option is not specified, the block counts will be displayed in units of that
size block.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/kmemxxx -compact
.It Pa /netbsd

.It Pa /dev/kmem
default source of tables

.Sh BUGS
Swap statistics are reported for all swap partitions compiled into the kernel,
regardless of whether those partitions are being used.
