Two versions of the dbmmanage script are included with this release.
One is the old faithful version, which should continue to work if you've
been using it; the other is a newer cut, which can be easily modified to
support the newer extended crypt routines which are present on some
systems (including 4.4BSD derivatives); this newer version is, for the
nonce, experimental...
