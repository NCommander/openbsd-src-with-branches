 * The exported function:
 *
 * 	 ap_sha1_base64(const char *clear, int len, char *out);
 *
 * provides a means to SHA1 crypt/encode a plaintext password in
 * a way which makes password files compatible with those commonly
 * used in netscape web and ldap installations. It was put together
 * by Clinton Wong <clintdw@netcom.com>, who also notes that:
 *
 * Note: SHA1 support is useful for migration purposes, but is less
 *     secure than Apache's password format, since Apache's (MD5)
 *     password format uses a random eight character salt to generate
 *     one of many possible hashes for the same password.  Netscape
 *     uses plain SHA1 without a salt, so the same password
 *     will always generate the same hash, making it easier
 *     to break since the search space is smaller.
 *
 * See also the documentation in support/SHA1 as to hints on how to
 * migrate an existing netscape installation and other supplied utitlites.
 *
 * This software also makes use of the following component:
 *
 * NIST Secure Hash Algorithm
 *  	heavily modified by Uwe Hollerbach uh@alumni.caltech edu
 *	from Peter C. Gutmann's implementation as found in
 *	Applied Cryptography by Bruce Schneier
 *	This code is hereby placed in the public domain
