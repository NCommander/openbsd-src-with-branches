 * ap_os_is_filename_valid is given a filename, and returns 0 if the filename

 * of the tests below. Otherwise returns 1.
 *
 * The tests are:
 *
 * 1) total path length greater than MAX_PATH
 * 
 * 2) the file path must contain a volume specifier and no / or \
 *     can appear before the volume specifier.
 *
 * 3) anything using the octets 0-31 or characters " < > | :
 *    (these are reserved for Windows use in filenames. In addition
 *     each file system has its own additional characters that are
 *     invalid. See KB article Q100108 for more details).
 *
 * 4) anything ending in "." (no matter how many)
 *    (filename doc, doc. and doc... all refer to the same file)
 *
 * 5) any segment in which the basename (before first period) matches
 *    one of the DOS device names
 *    (the list comes from KB article Q100108 although some people
 *     reports that additional names such as "COM5" are also special
 *     devices).
 *
 * If the path fails ANY of these tests, the result must be to deny access.
