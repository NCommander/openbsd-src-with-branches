=head1 DESCRIPTION

This library implements a generic hook interface for Apache which can be used
to loosely couple code through arbitrary hooks. There are two use cases for
this mechanism:

=over 3

=item B<1. Extension and Overrides>

Inside a specific code section you want to perform a specific function call
for extension reasons.  But you want to allow one or more modules to implement
this function by registering hooks. Those hooks are registered on a stack and
can be even configured to have a I<decline> return value. As long as there are
functions which return the decline value the next function on the stack is
tried. When the first function doesn't return the decline value the hook call
stops. 

The original intent of this use case is to provide a flexible extension
mechanism where modules can override functionality.

=item B<2. Intercommunication>

Inside a specific code you have a function you want to export. But you first
want to allow other code to override this function.  And second you want to
export this function without real object file symbol references. Instead you
want to register the function and let the users call this function by name. 

The original intent of this use case is to allow inter-module communication
without direct symbol references, which are a big I<no-no> for the I<Dynamic
Shared Object> (DSO) situation.

=back

And the following design goals existed:

=over 3

=item B<1. Minimum code changes>

The hook calls should look very similar to the corresponding direct function
call to allow one to easily translate it. And the total amount of changes for
the hook registration, hook configuration and hook usage should be as small as
possible to minimize the total code changes. Additionally a shorthand API
function (ap_hook_use) should be provided which lets one trivially add a hook
by just changing the code at a single location.

=item B<2. The hook call has to be maximum flexible>

In order to avoid nasty hacks, maximum flexiblity for the hook calls is
needed, i.e. any function signature (the set of types for the return value and
the arguments) should be supported.  And it should be possible to
register always a context (ctx) variable with a function which is passed to
the corresponding function when the hook call is performed.

=back

The implementation of this library directly followed these two design goals.

=head1 USAGE

Using this hook API is a four-step process:

=over 3

=item B<1. Initialization>

Initialize or destroy the hook mechanism inside your application program:

 ap_hook_init();
    :
 ap_hook_kill();

=item B<2. Configuration>

Configure a particular hook by specifing its name, signature and return type
semantic:

 ap_hook_configure("lookup", AP_HOOK_SIG2(ptr,ptr,ctx), AP_HOOK_DECLINE(NULL));
 ap_hook_configure("setup", AP_HOOK_SIG2(int,ptr,char), AP_HOOK_DECLTMP(FALSE));
 ap_hook_configure("read", AP_HOOK_SIG2(void,ptr), AP_HOOK_TOPMOST);
 ap_hook_configure("logit", AP_HOOK_SIG2(void,ptr), AP_HOOK_ALL);

This configures four hooks: 

A hook named C<lookup> with the signature C<void *lookup(void *, void *)>
(where the second argument is C<NULL> or the private context pointer of the
hook function which can be optionally provided at the registration step
later) and a return code semantic which says: Proceed as long as the
registered lookup functions return C<NULL> or no more registered functions
exists. A call for this hook has to provide 2 argument only (a pointer to the
return variable and the first argument), because the context is
implicitly provided by the hook mechanism. Sample idea: I<The first function
who was successful in looking up a variable provides the value>.

A hook named C<setup> with the signature C<int setup(void *, char)" and a
return code semantic equal to the one of the C<lookup> hook. But the decline
return value is implemented by a temporay variable of the hook mechanism and
only used for the decline decision. So a call to this hook has to provide 2
arguments only (the first and second argument, but no address to a return
value). Sample idea: I<Any function can handle the setup and when one
function handled it stops the processing by indicating this with the return
value>.

A hook named C<read> with the signature C<void read(void *)> and a return code
semantic which says: Only the top most function on the registered function
stack is tried (and independet of a possible return value in non-void
context). A call to this hook has to provide exactly 1 argument (the
single argument to the hook function). Sample idea: I<We want to
use a read function and allow others to override it, but independent how much
registered functions exists, only top most (= last registered) function
overrides and is used>.

A hook named C<logit> with the signature C<void logit(void *)> and a return
code semantic which says: All registered functions on the hook functioin stack
are tried. Sample idea: I<We pass a FILE pointer to the logging functions and
any function can log whatever it wants>.

=item B<3. Registration>

Register the actual functions which should be used by the hook:

 ap_hook_register("lookup", mylookup, mycontext);
 ap_hook_register("setup", mysetup);
 ap_hook_register("read", myread);
 ap_hook_register("logit", mylogit);

This registers the function C<mylookup()> under the C<lookup> hook with the
private context given by the variable C<mycontext>. And it registers the
function C<mysetup()> under the C<setup> hook without any context. Same for
C<myread> and C<mylogit>.

=item B<4. Usage>

Finally use the hooks, i.e. instead of using direct function calls like
        
 rc = mylookup(a1, a2);
 rc = mysetup(a1, a2);
 myread(a1);
 mylogit(a1);

you now use:

 ap_hook_call("lookup", &rc, a1, a2);
 ap_hook_call("setup", &rc, a1, a2);
 ap_hook_call("read", a1);
 ap_hook_call("logit", a1);

which are internally translated to:

 rc = mylookup(a1, a2, mycontext);
 rc = mysetup(a1, a2);
 myread(a1);
 mylogit(a1);

Notice two things here: First the context (C<mycontext>) for the C<mylookup()>
function is automatically added by the hook mechanism. And it is a different
(and not fixed) context for each registered function, of course.  Second,
return values always have to be pushed into variables and a pointer to them
has to be given as the second argument to C<ap_hook_call> (except for
functions which have a void return type, of course).

BTW, the return value of C<ap_hook_call()> is always C<TRUE> or C<FALSE>.
C<TRUE> when at least one function call was successful (always the case for
C<AP_HOOK_TOPMOST> and C<AP_HOOK_ALL>). C<FALSE> when all functions
returned the decline value or no functions are registered at all.

=head1 RESTRICTIONS

To make the hook implementation efficient and to not bloat up the code too
much a few restrictions have to make:

=over 3

=item 1.

Only function calls with up to 4 arguments are implemented. When more are
needed you can either extend the hook implementation by using more bits for
the signature configuration or you can do a workaround when the function is
your own one: Put the remaining (N-4-1) arguments into a structure and pass
only a pointer (one argument) as the forth argument.

=item 2.

Only the following ANSI C variable types are supported:

 - For the return value: 
   void (= none), char, int, float, double, ptr (= void *)
 - For the arguments:
   ctx  (= context), char, int, float, double, ptr (= void *)

This means in theory that 6^5 (=7776) signature combinations are possible. But
because we don't need all of them inside Apache and it would bloat up the code
too dramatically we implement only a subset of those combinations. The
implemented signatures can be specified inside C<ap_hook.c> and the
corresponding code can be automatically generated by running ``C<perl
ap_hook.c>'' (yeah, no joke ;-).  So when you need a hook with a different
still not implemented signature you either have to again use a workaround as
above (i.e. use a structure) or just add the signature to the C<ap_hook.c>
file.

=head1 EXAMPLE

We want to call `C<ssize_t read(int, void *, size_t)>' through hooks in order
to allow modules to override this call.  So, somewhere we have a replacement
function for C<read()> defined (same signature, of course):

 ssize_t my_read(int, void *, size_t);

We now configure a C<read> hook. Here the C<AP_HOOK_SIGx()> macro defines the
signature of the C<read()>-like callback functions and has to match the
prototype of C<read()>. But we have to replace typedefs with the physical
underlaying ANSI C types. And C<AP_HOOK_DECLINE()> sets the return value of
the read()-like functions which forces the next hook to be called (here -1).
And we register the original C<read()> function as the default hook.

 ap_hook_configure("read", 
                   AP_HOOK_SIG4(int,int,ptr,int), 
                   AP_HOOK_DECLINE(-1));
 ap_hook_register("read", read);

Now a module wants to override the C<read()> call and registers the
C<my_read()> function:

 ap_hook_register("read", my_read);

The function logically gets pushed onto a stack, so the execution order is the
reverse registering order, i.e. I<last registered - first called>. Now we can
replace the standard C<read()> call

 bytes = read(fd, buf, bufsize);
 if (bytes == -1)
    ...error...

with the hook based call:

  rc = ap_hook_call("read", &bytes, fd, buf, bufsize);
  if (rc == FALSE)
     ...error...

Now internally the following is done: The call `C<bytes = my_read(fd, buf,
bufsize)>' is done. When it returns not -1 (the decline value) nothing
more is done. But when C<my_read()> returns -1 the next function is tried:
`C<bytes = read(fd, buf, bufsize)>'. When this one also returns -1 you get
`rc == FALSE'. When it finally returns not -1 you get `rc == TRUE'.
