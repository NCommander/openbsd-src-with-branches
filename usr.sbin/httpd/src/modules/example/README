README for Apache 1.2 Example Module
[April, 1997]

The files in the src/modules/example directory under the Apache
distribution directory tree are provided as an example to those that
wish to write modules that use the Apache API.

The main file is mod_example.c, which illustrates all the different
callback mechanisms and call syntaces.  By no means does an add-on
module need to include routines for all of the callbacks - quite the
contrary!

The example module is an actual working module.  If you link it into
your server, enable the "example-handler" handler for a location, and then
browse to that location, you will see a display of some of the tracing
the example module did as the various callbacks were made.

To include the example module in your server, follow the steps below:

    1. Uncomment the "Module example_module" line near the bottom of
       the src/Configuration file.  If there isn't one, add it; it
       should look like this:

       Module example_module        modules/example/mod_example.o

    2. Run the src/Configure script ("cd src; ./Configure").  This will
       build the Makefile for the server itself, and update the
       src/modules/Makefile for any additional modules you have
       requested from beneath that subdirectory.

    3. Make the server (run "make" in the src directory).

To add another module of your own:

    A. mkdir src/modules/mymodule
    B. cp src/modules/example/* src/modules/mymodule
    C. Modify the files in the new directory
    D. Follow steps [1] through [3] above, with appropriate changes.

To activate the example module, include a block similar to the
following in your srm.conf file:

    <Location /example-info>
	SetHandler example-handler
    </Location>

As an alternative, you can put the following into a .htaccess file and
then request the file "test.example" from that location:

    AddHandler example-handler .example

After reloading/restarting your server, you should be able to browse
to this location and see the brief display mentioned earlier.
