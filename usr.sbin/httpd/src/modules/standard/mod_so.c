/* 
 * This module is used to load Apache modules at runtime. This means that the
 * server functionality can be extended without recompiling and even without
 * taking the server down at all. Only a HUP or USR1 signal needs to be send
 * to the server to reload the dynamically loaded modules.
 *
 * To use, you'll first need to build your module as a shared library, then
 * update your configuration (httpd.conf) to get the Apache core to load the
 * module at start-up.
 *
 * The easiest way to build a module as a shared library is to use the
 * `SharedModule' command in the Configuration file, instead of `AddModule'.
 * You should also change the file extension from `.o' to `.so'. So, for
 * example, to build the status module as a shared library edit Configuration
 * and change
 *   AddModule    modules/standard/mod_status.o
 * to
 *   SharedModule modules/standard/mod_status.so
 *
 * Run Configure and make. Now Apache's httpd binary will _not_ include
 * mod_status. Instead a shared object called mod_status.so will be build, in
 * the modules/standard directory. You can build most of the modules as shared
 * libraries like this.
 *
 * To use the shared module, move the .so file(s) into an appropriate
 * directory. You might like to create a directory called "modules" under you
 * server root for this (e.g. /usr/local/httpd/modules). 
 *
 * Then edit your conf/httpd.conf file, and add LoadModule lines. For
 * example
 *   LoadModule  status_module   modules/mod_status.so
 *
 * The first argument is the module's structure name (look at the end of the
 * module source to find this). The second option is the path to the module
 * file, relative to the server root.  Put these directives right at the top
 * of your httpd.conf file.
 *
 * Now you can start Apache. A message will be logged at "debug" level to your
 * error_log to confirm that the module(s) are loaded (use "LogLevel debug"
 * directive to get these log messages).
 *
 * If you edit the LoadModule directives while the server is live you can get
 * Apache to re-load the modules by sending it a HUP or USR1 signal as normal.
 * You can use this to dynamically change the capability of your server
 * without bringing it down.
 *
 * Because currently there is only limited built-in support in the Configure
 * script for creating the shared library files (`.so'), please consult your
 * vendors cc(1), ld(1) and dlopen(3) manpages to find out the appropriate
 * compiler and linker flags and insert them manually into the Configuration
 * file under CFLAGS_SHLIB, LDFLAGS_SHLIB and LDFLAGS_SHLIB_EXPORT.
 *
 * If you still have problems figuring out the flags both try the paper
 *     http://developer.netscape.com/library/documentation/enterprise
 *                                          /unix/svrplug.htm#1013807
 * or install a Perl 5 interpreter on your platform and then run the command
 *
 *     $ perl -V:usedl -V:ccdlflags -V:cccdlflags -V:lddlflags
 *
 * This gives you what type of dynamic loading Perl 5 uses on your platform
 * and which compiler and linker flags Perl 5 uses to create the shared object
 * files.
 *
 * Another location where you can find useful hints is the `ltconfig' script
 * of the GNU libtool 1.2 package. Search for your platform name inside the
 * various "case" constructs.
