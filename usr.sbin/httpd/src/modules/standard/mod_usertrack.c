/* User Tracking Module (Was mod_cookies.c)
 *
 * This Apache module is designed to track users paths through a site.
 * It uses the client-side state ("Cookie") protocol developed by Netscape.
 * It is known to work on Netscape browsers, Microsoft Internet
 * Explorer and others currently being developed.
 *
 * Each time a page is requested we look to see if the browser is sending
 * us a Cookie: header that we previously generated.
 *
 * If we don't find one then the user hasn't been to this site since
 * starting their browser or their browser doesn't support cookies.  So
 * we generate a unique Cookie for the transaction and send it back to
 * the browser (via a "Set-Cookie" header)
 * Future requests from the same browser should keep the same Cookie line.
 *
 * By matching up all the requests with the same cookie you can
 * work out exactly what path a user took through your site.  To log
 * the cookie use the " %{Cookie}n " directive in a custom access log;
 *
 * Example 1 : If you currently use the standard Log file format (CLF)
 * and use the command "TransferLog somefilename", add the line
 *       LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b %{Cookie}n"
 * to your config file.
 *
 * Example 2 : If you used to use the old "CookieLog" directive, you
 * can emulate it by adding the following command to your config file
 *       CustomLog filename "%{Cookie}n \"%r\" %t"
 *
 * Notes:
 * 1.  This code now logs the initial transaction (the one that created
 *     the cookie to start with).
 * 2.  This module has been designed to not interfere with other Cookies
 *     your site may be using; just avoid sending out cookies with
 *     the name "Apache=" or things will get confused.
 * 3.  If you want you can modify the Set-Cookie line so that the Cookie
 *     never expires.  You would then get the same Cookie each time the
 *     user revisits your site.
