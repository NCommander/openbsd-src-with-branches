/*  
 * This handles Netscape CONNECT method secure proxy requests.
 * A connection is opened to the specified host and data is
 * passed through between the WWW site and the browser.
 *
 * This code is based on the INTERNET-DRAFT document
 * "Tunneling SSL Through a WWW Proxy" currently at
 * http://www.mcom.com/newsref/std/tunneling_ssl.html.
 *
 * If proxyhost and proxyport are set, we send a CONNECT to 
 * the specified proxy..  
 *
 * FIXME: this is bad, because it does its own socket I/O
 *        instead of using the I/O in buff.c.  However,
 *        the I/O in buff.c blocks on reads, and because
 *        this function doesn't know how much data will
 *        be sent either way (or when) it can't use blocking
 *        I/O.  This may be very implementation-specific
 *        (to Linux).  Any suggestions?
 * FIXME: this doesn't log the number of bytes sent, but
 *        that may be okay, since the data is supposed to
 *        be transparent. In fact, this doesn't log at all
 *        yet. 8^)
 * FIXME: doesn't check any headers initally sent from the
 *        client.
 * FIXME: should allow authentication, but hopefully the
 *        generic proxy authentication is good enough.
 * FIXME: no check for r->assbackwards, whatever that is.
