/*
 * mod_userdir... implement the UserDir command.  Broken away from the
 * Alias stuff for a couple of good and not-so-good reasons:
 *
 * 1) It shows a real minimal working example of how to do something like
 *    this.
 * 2) I know people who are actually interested in changing this *particular*
 *    aspect of server functionality without changing the rest of it.  That's
 *    what this whole modular arrangement is supposed to be good at...
 *
 * Modified by Alexei Kosut to support the following constructs
 * (server running at www.foo.com, request for /~bar/one/two.html)
 *
 * UserDir public_html      -> ~bar/public_html/one/two.html
 * UserDir /usr/web         -> /usr/web/bar/one/two.html
 * UserDir /home/ * /www     -> /home/bar/www/one/two.html
 *  NOTE: theses ^ ^ space only added allow it to work in a comment, ignore
 * UserDir http://x/users   -> (302) http://x/users/bar/one/two.html
 * UserDir http://x/ * /y     -> (302) http://x/bar/y/one/two.html
 *  NOTE: here also ^ ^
 *
 * In addition, you can use multiple entries, to specify alternate
 * user directories (a la Directory Index). For example:
 *
 * UserDir public_html /usr/web http://www.xyz.com/users
 *
