       rroottaatteellooggss is a simple program for use in conjunction with
       Apache's  piped  logfile  feature  which  can be used like
       this:

          TransferLog  "|   rotatelogs   /path/to/logs/access_log
       86400"

       This creates the files /path/to/logs/access_log.nnnn where
       nnnn is the system time at which the log nominally  starts
       (this time will always be a multiple of the rotation time,
       so you can synchronize cron scripts with it).  At the  end
       of  each  rotation time (here after 24 hours) a new log is
       started.

       _l_o_g_f_i_l_e
              The path plus basename of the logfile.  If  llooggffiillee
              includes  any %% characters, it is treated as a for-
              mat string for _s_t_r_f_t_i_m_e_(_3_).  Otherwise, the  suffix
              .nnnn  is  automatically  added  and is the time at
              which the logfile was created.

       _r_o_t_a_t_i_o_n_t_i_m_e
              The rotation time in seconds.

       _o_f_f_s_e_t The number of minutes offset from UTC.  If omitted,
              zero  is  assumed and UTC is used.  For example, to
              use local time in the zone UTC -5 hours, specify  a
              value of _-_3_0_0 for this argument.
