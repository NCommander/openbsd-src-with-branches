.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ab
is a tool for benchmarking the performance of your Apache HyperText Transfer
Protocol (HTTP) server.  It does this by giving you an indication of how
many requests per second your Apache installation can serve.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 12
.B \-k 
Enable the HTTP KeepAlive feature; that is, perform multiple requests
within one HTTP session. Default is no KeepAlive.
.TP 12
.B \-i
Use an HTTP 'HEAD' instead of the GET method. Cannot be mixed with POST.
.TP 12
.BI \-n " requests"
The number of requests to perform for the benchmarking session.  The
default is to perform just one single request, which will not give
representative benchmarking results.
.TP 12
.BI \-t " timelimit"
The number of seconds to spend benchmarking. Using this option automatically
set the number of requests for the benchmarking session to 50000.
Use this to benchmark the server for a fixed period of time.  By
default, there is no timelimit. 
.TP 12
.BI \-c " concurrency"
The number of simultaneous requests to perform. The default is to
perform one HTTP request at at time, that is, no concurrency.

.TP 12
.BI \-p " POST file"
A file containing data that the program will send to the Apache server in
any HTTP POST requests.

.TP 12
.BI \-A " Authorization username:password"
Supply Basic Authentication credentials to the server. The username
and password are separated by a single ':', and sent as uuencoded data.
The string is sent regardless of whether the server needs it; that is,
has sent a 401 Authentication needed.

.TP 12
.BI \-p " Proxy-Authorization username:password"
Supply Basic Authentication credentials to a proxy en-route. The username
and password are separated by a single ':', and sent as uuencoded data.
The string is sent regardless of whether the proxy needs it; that is,
has sent a 407 Proxy authentication needed.

.TP 12
.BI \-C " Cookie name=value"
Add a 'Cookie:' line to the request. The argument is typically
a 'name=value' pair. This option may be repeated.

.TP 12
.BI \-p " Header string"
Append extra headers to the request. The argument is typically in the form
of a valid header line, usually a colon separated field value pair, for
example, 'Accept-Encoding: zip/zop;8bit'.

.TP 12
.BI \-T " content-type"
The content-type header to use for POST data.

.TP 12
.B \-v 
Sets the verbosity level.  Level 4 and above prints information on headers,
level 3 and above prints response codes (for example, 404, 200), and level 2
and above prints warnings and informational messages.

.TP 12
.BI \-w
Print out results in HTML tables.  The default table is two columns wide,
with a white background.
.TP 12
.BI \-x " attributes"
The string to use as attributes for <table>.  Attributes are inserted
<table 
.B here
>
.TP 12
.BI \-y " attributes"
The string to use as attributes for <tr>.
.TP 12
.BI \-z " attributes"
The string to use as attributes for <td>.
.TP 12
.B \-V
Display the version number and exit.
.TP 12
.B \-h 
Display usage information.
.PD
.SH BUGS
There are various statically declared buffers of fixed length. Combined
with inefficient parsing of the command line arguments, the response headers
from the server, and other external inputs, these buffers might overflow.
.P
.B Ab
does not implement HTTP/1.x fully; instead, it only accepts
some 'expected' forms of responses.
.P
The rather heavy use of 
.BR strstr(3)
by the program may skew performance results, since it uses significant
CPU resources.  Make sure that performance limits are not hit by
.B ab
before your server's limit is reached.
