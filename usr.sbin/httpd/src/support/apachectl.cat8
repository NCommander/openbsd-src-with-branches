       aappaacchheeccttll  is a front end to the Apache HyperText Transfer
       Protocol (HTTP) server.  It is designed to help the admin-
       istrator  control the functioning of the Apache hhttttppdd dae-
       mon.

       NNOOTTEE:: If your Apache installation uses non-standard paths,
       you  will  need  to  edit  the aappaacchheeccttll script to set the
       appropriate paths to your PID file and your hhttttppdd  binary.
       See the comments in the script for details.

       The  aappaacchheeccttll  script  returns a 0 exit value on success,
       and >0 if an error occurs.  For  more  details,  view  the
       comments in the script.

       Full    documentation   for   Apache   is   available   at

       The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d can be  any  one  or  more  of  the  following
       options:

       ssttaarrtt       Start the Apache daemon.  Gives an error if it
                   is already running.

       ssttoopp        Stops the Apache daemon.

       rreessttaarrtt     Restarts the Apache daemon  by  sending  it  a
                   SIGHUP.   If  the daemon is not running, it is
                   started.  This  command  automatically  checks
                   the  configuration files via ccoonnffiiggtteesstt before
                   initiating the restart  to  make  sure  Apache
                   doesn't die.

       ffuullllssttaattuuss  Displays a full status report from mmoodd__ssttaattuuss..
                   For this to work, you need to have  mod_status
                   enabled   on  your  server  and  a  text-based
                   browser such as _l_y_n_x available on your system.
                   The  URL  used to access the status report can
                   be set by editing the  SSTTAATTUUSSUURRLL  variable  in
                   the script.

       ssttaattuuss      Displays  a  brief  status report.  Similar to
                   the fullstatus option, except that the list of
                   requests currently being served is omitted.

       ggrraacceeffuull    Gracefully restarts the Apache daemon by send-
                   ing it  a  SIGUSR1.   If  the  daemon  is  not

                   running,  it  is started.  This differs from a
                   normal restart in that currently open  connec-
                   tions  are not aborted.  A side effect is that
                   old log files will not be closed  immediately.
                   This  means  that  if  used  in a log rotation
                   script, a substantial delay may  be  necessary
                   to  ensure  that  the old log files are closed
                   before processing them.  This command automat-
                   ically checks the configuration files via ccoonn--
                   ffiiggtteesstt before initiating the restart to  make
                   sure Apache doesn't die.

       ccoonnffiiggtteesstt  Run  a  configuration  file  syntax  test.  It
                   parses  the  configuration  files  and  either
                   reports  SSyynnttaaxx  OOkk  or  detailed  information
                   about the particular syntax error.
