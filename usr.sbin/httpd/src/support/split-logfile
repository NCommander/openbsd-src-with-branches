# This script will take a combined Web server access
# log file and break its contents into separate files.
# It assumes that the first field of each line is the
# virtual host identity (put there by "%v"), and that
# the logfiles should be named that+".log" in the current
# directory.
#
# The combined log file is read from stdin. Records read
# will be appended to any existing log files.
