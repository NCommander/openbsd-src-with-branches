       llooggrreessoollvvee  is  a  post-processing  program to resolve IP-
       adresses in Apache's access logfiles.  To minimize  impact
       on  your  nameserver, logresolve has its very own internal
       hash-table cache. This means that each IP number will only
       be looked up the first time it is found in the log file.

       --cc          This  causes  llooggrreessoollvvee  to  apply  some  DNS
                   checks: after finding the hostname from the IP
                   address,  it looks up the IP addresses for the
                   hostname and checks that one of these  matches
                   the original address.
