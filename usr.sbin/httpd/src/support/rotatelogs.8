.SH NAME
rotatelogs \- rotate Apache logs without having to kill the server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rotatelogs
.I logfile
.I rotationtime
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rotatelogs
is a simple program for use in conjunction with Apache's piped logfile
feature which can be used like this:

.fi
   TransferLog "|rotatelogs /path/to/logs/access_log 86400"
.mf

This creates the files /path/to/logs/access_log.nnnn where nnnn is the system
time at which the log nominally starts (this time will always be a multiple of
the rotation time, so you can synchronize cron scripts with it).  At the end
of each rotation time (here after 24 hours) a new log is started.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\fIlogfile\fP
The path plus basename of the logfile. The suffix .nnnn is automatically
added.
.IP \fB\fIrotationtime\fP
The rotation time in seconds.
