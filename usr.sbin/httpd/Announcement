Apache 1.3.3 Released
=====================

The Apache Group is pleased to announce the release of version
1.3.3 of the Apache HTTP server.

This new Apache version is a bugfix release, primarily to fix a
serious problem with server error reporting introduced in 1.3.2.
This affected the functionality of most custom ErrorDocuments and
of some modules that depend on special error output (e.g., mod_speling).
A side-effect bug that resulted in incorrect error reporting of
nonexistent .htaccess files has also been fixed.

Additional changes in this release consist of new supported platforms,
Win32 and Unix portability fixes, ErrorDocument environment enhancements,
improved protocol behavior to match the HTTP/1.1 revised specification,
and assorted other features or fixes.  Users should review the CHANGES file
and decide on their upgrade plans.  We consider Apache 1.3.3 to be the
most stable version of Apache available and we strongly recommend that
users of older versions, especially of the 1.1.x and 1.2.x family, upgrade
as soon as possible.

Apache 1.3.3 is available for download from

    http://www.apache.org/dist/

Please see the CHANGES_1.3 file in the same directory for a full
list of changes.  The distribution is also available via any of
the mirrors listed at

In general, Apache 1.3 offers several substantial improvements
over version 1.2, including better performance, reliability and a
wider range of supported platforms, including Windows 95 and NT
(which both fall under the "Win32" label).

Apache is the most popular web server in the known universe; over
half of the servers on the Internet are running Apache or one of
its variants.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR WIN32 USERS: Over the years, many users have
come to trust Apache as a secure and stable server.  It must
be realized that the current Win32 code has not yet reached these
levels and should still be considered to be of beta quality.  Any
Win32 stability or security problems do not impact, in any way,
Apache on other platforms.  With the continued donation of time
and resources by individuals and companies, we hope that the Win32
version of Apache will grow stronger through the 1.3.x release cycle.
