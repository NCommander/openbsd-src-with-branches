   The Apache Software Foundation and The Apache Server Project are
   pleased to announce the release of version 1.3.23 of the Apache HTTP
   server. This Announcement notes the significant changes in 1.3.23.

   This version of Apache is principally a security fix release which
   closes some problems where a directory listing could be obtained
   instead of the default index page. A summary of the bug fixes and major
   new features is given at the end of this document.

   We consider Apache 1.3.23 to be the best version of Apache available
   and we strongly recommend that users of older versions, especially of
   the 1.1.x and 1.2.x family, upgrade as soon as possible. No further
   releases will be made in the 1.2.x family.

   Apache 1.3.23 is available for download from
   
       http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/

   Please see the CHANGES_1.3 file in the same directory for a full list
   of changes.

   Binary distributions are available from

       http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/

   The source and binary distributions are also available via any of the
   mirrors listed at

       http://www.apache.org/mirrors/

   As of Apache 1.3.17, Win32 binary distributions are now based on the
   Microsoft Installer (.MSI) technology. This change occurred in order to
   resolve the many problems WinME and Win2K users experienced with the
   older InstallShield-based installer.exe file.  While development
   continues to make this new installation method more robust, questions
   should be directed at the news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows
   newsgroup.

   As of Apache 1.3.12 binary distributions contain all standard Apache
   modules as shared objects (if supported by the platform) and include
   full source code.  Installation is easily done by executing the
   included install script.  See the README.bindist and INSTALL.bindist
   files for a complete explanation.  Please note that the binary
   distributions are only provided for your convenience and current
   distributions for specific platforms are not always available.

   For an overview of new features introduced after 1.2 please see
   
   http://httpd.apache.org/docs/new_features_1_3.html

   In general, Apache 1.3 offers several substantial improvements over
   version 1.2, including better performance, reliability and a wider
   range of supported platforms, including Windows NT and 2000 (which
   fall under the "Win32" label), OS2, Netware, and TPE threaded
   platforms.

   Apache is the most popular web server in the known universe; over half
   of the servers on the Internet are running Apache or one of its
   variants.

   IMPORTANT NOTE FOR WIN32 USERS: Over the years, many users have come
   to trust Apache as a secure and stable server. It must be realized
   that the current Win32 code has not yet reached the levels of the Unix
   version, but is of acceptable quality. Win32 stability or security
   problems do not reflect on the Unix version.

                     Apache 1.3.23 Major changes

  Security vulnerabilities

     * None addressed.

  New features

   The main new features in 1.3.23 (compared to 1.3.22) are:

     * HTTP/1.1 support for mod_proxy.
     * Other mod_proxy improvements.
     * The new 'FileETag' directive to allow one to build the
       format of the ETag via runtime directives.
     * Addition of a 'filter callback' function to enable modules to
       intercept the output byte stream for dynamic page caching.

   New features that relate to specific platforms:

     * Use "httpready" accept filter rather than "dataready"
       on post 4.1.1-RELEASE versions of FreeBSD.

  Bugs fixed

   The following bugs were found in Apache 1.3.22 and have been fixed in
   Apache 1.3.23:

     * Fix incorrect "Content-Length" header in the 416 response.
     * Revert mod_negotation's handling of path_info and query_args
       to the 1.3.20 behavior (PRs: 8628, 8582, 8538).
     * Prevent an Apache module from being loaded or added twice due
       to duplicate LoadModule or AddModule directives.

   The following bugs relate to specific platforms:

     * Fixed the access forbidden problem when requesting an empty directory
       on Netware.
     * Do not kill the child process when accept() returns ENOBUFS on
       HPUX 11.*
     * A default locking mechanism has been defined for Unixware 7.0 and later.
