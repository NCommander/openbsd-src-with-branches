Apache 1.3.4 Released
=====================

The Apache Group is pleased to announce the release of version
1.3.4 of the Apache HTTP server.

This new Apache version incorporates over 90 significant improvements
to the server, including avoidance of some denial-of-service attacks,
support for 3rd-party WebDAV modules, a complete overhaul of content
negotiation, optional column sorting for fancy indexes, the ability to
set a DefaultLanguage, and many fixes to improve consistency, portability,
and squish bugs.  A complete listing is provided in the src/CHANGES file.

Of special note are the many changes to the Apache configuration process.
The default path layout generated by the "configure" script has been
changed to be more consistent with the traditional Apache layout, and
several new command-line options have been added to make compilation
easier.  Please see the README.configure and INSTALL files for complete
information.  In addition, we have moved all of the server configuration
directives to a single file (httpd.conf-dist), updated mime.types, and
improved the examples for first-time installers.  Finally, a few of the
rarely-used command-line options for httpd have been changed to be more
consistent with the help options of other programs.

We consider Apache 1.3.4 to be the best version of Apache available and
we strongly recommend that users of older versions, especially of the
1.1.x and 1.2.x family, upgrade as soon as possible.  No further releases
will be made in the 1.2.x family.

Apache 1.3.4 is available for download from

    http://www.apache.org/dist/

Please see the CHANGES_1.3 file in the same directory for a full
list of changes.  The distribution is also available via any of
the mirrors listed at

In general, Apache 1.3 offers several substantial improvements
over version 1.2, including better performance, reliability and a
wider range of supported platforms, including Windows 95 and NT
(which both fall under the "Win32" label).

Apache is the most popular web server in the known universe; over
half of the servers on the Internet are running Apache or one of
its variants.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR WIN32 USERS: Over the years, many users have
come to trust Apache as a secure and stable server.  It must
be realized that the current Win32 code has not yet reached these
levels and should still be considered to be of beta quality.  Any
Win32 stability or security problems do not impact, in any way,
Apache on other platforms.  With the continued donation of time
and resources by individuals and companies, we hope that the Win32
version of Apache will grow stronger through the 1.3.x release cycle.
