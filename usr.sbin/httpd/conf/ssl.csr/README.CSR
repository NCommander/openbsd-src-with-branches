 This is the ssl.csr/ directory of Apache/mod_ssl
 where PEM-encoded X.509 Certificate Signing Requests for SSL are stored.

 Per default the following file is provided:

 o server.csr:
   This is the server certificate signing request for Apache/mod_ssl
   corresponding to the ../ssl.crt/server.crt file.  Per default this is a
   dummy file, but may be overwritten by the `make certificate' target under
   built-time.  Then it contains the CSR which you can send to a public
   Certification Authority (CA) for requesting a real signed certificate
   (which then can replace the ../ssl.crt/server.crt file).

 You can also use this directory for temporarily storing CSRs from within your
 (CGI-) scripts when you want to perform client authentication with your own
 CA instance.

 You can view the ingredients of a particular CSR file in plain text
 by running the command:

   $ openssl req -noout -text -in <name>.csr
