 This is the ssl.key/ directory of Apache/mod_ssl
 where PEM-encoded RSA Private Keys for SSL are stored.

 Per default the following files are provided:

 o server.key:
   This is the server private key for Apache/mod_ssl, configured with the
   SSLCertificateKeyFile directive. Per default this is a dummy file, but may
   be overwritten by the `make certificate' target under built-time.

 o snakeoil.key:
   This is the private key of the _DEMONSTRATION ONLY_ `Snake Oil' Server.  It
   corresponds to the dummy server certificate ../ssl.crt/snakeoil.crt.  NEVER
   USE THIS PRIVATE KEY YOURSELF FOR REAL LIFE! INSTEAD USE A REAL SERVER KEY!

 o snakeoil-ca.key:
   This is the private key of the _DEMONSTRATION ONLY_ `Snake Oil' Certificate
   Authority. It is used to sign the ../ssl.crt/server.crt on `make
   certificate' because self-signed server certificates are not accepted by
   all browsers. NEVER USE THIS PRIVATE KEY YOURSELF FOR REAL LIFE! INSTEAD
   EITHER USE A PUBLICALLY KNOWN CA OR CREATE YOUR OWN CA!

 You can view the ingredients of a particular private key file in plain text
 by running the command (a pass phrase may be queried):

   $ openssl rsa -noout -text -in <name>.key
