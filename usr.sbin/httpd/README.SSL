  OVERVIEW

  Description
  ___________

  This Apache module provides strong cryptography for the Apache 1.3 webserver
  via the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS
  v1) protocols by the help of the SSL/TLS implementation library SSLeay from
  Eric A. Young and Tim J. Hudson. 
 
  The mod_ssl package was created in April 1998 by Ralf S. Engelschall and was
  originally derived from software developed by Ben Laurie for use in the
  Apache-SSL HTTP server project.  Additionally it uses a tool developed by
  Larry Wall and David MacKenzie for use in the GNU project of the FSF.

  Features
  ________

  The mod_ssl package provides the following features:

   o  Open-Source software (BSD-style license)
   o  Useable for both commercial and non-commercial use
   o  Available for both Unix and Win32 platforms
   o  128-bit strong cryptography world-wide
   o  Support for SSLv2, SSLv3 and TLSv1 protocols
   o  Clean reviewable ANSI C source code 
   o  Clean Apache module architecture
   o  Integrates seamlessly into Apache through an Extended API (EAPI)
   o  Full Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) support
   o  Support for the SSLeay+RSAref US-situation
   o  Advanced pass-phrase handling for private keys
   o  X.509 certificate based authentication for both client and server
   o  Support for per-URL renegotiation of SSL handshake parameters
   o  Support for explicit seeding of the PRNG from external sources
   o  Additional boolean-expression based access control facility
   o  Backward compatibility to other Apache SSL solutions
   o  Inter-process SSL session cache
   o  Powerful dedicated SSL engine logging facility
   o  Simple and robust application to Apache source trees
   o  Fully integrated into the Apache 1.3 configuration mechanism
   o  Additional integration into the Apache Autoconf-style Interface (APACI)
   o  Assistance in X.509 v3 certificate generation

  Restrictions
  ____________

  Additionally you have to accept the following restriction:
  
  Please REMEMBER that export/import and/or use of cryptography software or
  even just providing cryptography hooks is illegal in some parts of the
  world.  When you re-distribute this package or even email
  patches/suggestions to the authors or other people PLEASE PAY CLOSE
  ATTENTION TO ANY APPLICABLE EXPORT/IMPORT LAWS. The author of mod_ssl is not
  liable for any violations you make here. So be carefully yourself.

  Security Concerns
  _________________

  You should be very sensible when using cryptography software, because just
  running an SSL server _DOES NOT_ mean your system is then secure!  This is
  for a number of reasons. The following questions illustrate some of the
  problems.

   o  SSL itself may not be secure. People think it is, do you?
   o  Does this code implement SSL correctly?
   o  Have the authors of the various components put in back doors?
   o  Does the code take appropriate measures to keep private keys private? 
      To what extent is your cooperation in this process required?
   o  Is your system physically secure?
   o  Is your system appropriately secured from intrusion over the network?
   o  Whom do you trust? Do you understand the trust relationship involved 
      in SSL certificates? Do your system administrators?
   o  Are your keys, and keys you trust, generated careful enough to
      avoid reverse engineering of the private keys?
   o  How do you obtain certificates, keys, and the like, securely?
   o  Can you trust your users to safeguard their private keys?
   o  Can you trust your browser to safeguard its generated private key?
  
  If you can't answer these questions to your personal satisfaction, then you
  usually have a problem. Even if you can, you may still _NOT_ be secure.
  Don't blame the authors if it all goes horribly wrong. Use it at your own
  risk!

  Installation
  ____________

  For installing mod_ssl under Unix please read the document INSTALL,
  for installing under Win32 read the document INSTALL.Win32.

  Compatibility
  _____________

  This module was developed and tested with Communicator 4.05, Lynx and cURL
  under FreeBSD 2.2.6 as the clients only. But it should work with other
  Navigator/Communicator variants, too. Even Internet Explorer users should be
  able to use this software.

  Credits
  _______

  Special thanks to The Apache Group and the NCSA for Apache, to Eric A. Young
  and Tim J. Hudson for SSLeay and to Ben Laurie for the original Apache-SSL
  on which mod_ssl is based. Without the effort of these people mod_ssl would
  not be possible.
