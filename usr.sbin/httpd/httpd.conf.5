.Sh NAME
.Nm httpd.conf
.Nd HTTP daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file for the HTTP daemon,
.Xr httpd 8 .
.Sh SECTIONS
.Nm
is divided into four main sections:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sy Macros
User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sy Global Configuration
Global settings for
.Xr httpd 8 .
.It Sy Servers
Listening HTTP web servers.
.It Sy Types
Media types and extensions.
.El
.Pp
Within the sections,
a host
.Ar address
can be specified by IPv4 address, IPv6 address, interface name,
interface group, or DNS hostname.
If the address is an interface name,
.Xr httpd 8
will look up the first IPv4 address and any other IPv4 and IPv6
addresses of the specified network interface.
If
.Sq *
is given as an address,
it will be used as an alias for
.Ar 0.0.0.0
to listen on all IPv4 addresses.
Likewise,
.Sq ::
can be used to listen on all IPv6 addresses.
A
.Ar port
can be specified by number or name.
The port name to number mappings are found in the file
.Pa /etc/services ;
see
.Xr services 5
for details.
.Pp
The current line can be extended over multiple lines using a backslash
.Pq Sq \e .
Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark
.Pq Sq # ,
and extend to the end of the current line.
Care should be taken when commenting out multi-line text:
the comment is effective until the end of the entire block.
.Pp
Argument names not beginning with a letter, digit, or underscore
must be quoted.
.Pp
Additional configuration files can be included with the
.Ic include
keyword, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
include "/etc/httpd.conf.local"
.Ed
.Sh MACROS
Macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, digit, or underscore,
and may contain any of those characters.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example,
.Ic directory ,
.Ic log ,
or
.Ic root ) .
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ext_ip="10.0.0.1"
server "default" {
	listen on $ext_ip port 80
}
.Ed
.Sh GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
Here are the settings that can be set globally:
.Bl -tag -width Ds

directory.
If not specified, it defaults to
.Pa /var/www ,
the home directory of the www user.
.It Ic logdir Ar directory
Specifies the full path of the directory in which log files will be written.
If not specified, it defaults to
.Pa /logs
within the
.Xr chroot 2
directory.
.It Ic prefork Ar number
Run the specified number of server processes.
This increases the performance and prevents delays when connecting
to a server.
.Xr httpd 8
runs 3 server processes by default.
.El
.Sh SERVERS
The configured web servers.
.Pp
Each
.Ic server
must have a
.Ar name
and include one or more lines of the following syntax:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic alias Ar name
Specify an additional alias
.Ar name
for this server.
.It Oo Ic no Oc Ic authenticate Oo Ar realm Oc Ic with Pa htpasswd
Authenticate a remote user for
.Ar realm
by checking the credentials against the user authentication file
.Pa htpasswd .
The file name is relative to the
.Ic chroot
and must be readable by the www user.
Use the
.Ic no authenticate
directive to disable authentication in a location.
.It Ic connection Ar option
Set the specified options and limits for HTTP connections.
Valid options are:

Set the maximum body size in bytes that the client can send to the server.
The default value is 1048576 bytes (1M).
.It Ic max requests Ar number
Set the maximum number of requests per persistent HTTP connection.
Persistent connections are negotiated using the Keep-Alive header in
HTTP/1.0 and enabled by default in HTTP/1.1.
The default maximum number of requests per connection is 100.
.It Ic timeout Ar seconds
Specify the inactivity timeout in seconds for accepted sessions.
The default timeout is 600 seconds (10 minutes).
The maximum is 2147483647 seconds (68 years).
.El
.It Ic directory Ar option
Set the specified options when serving or accessing directories.
Valid options are:

.Xr chroot 2
root directory of
.Xr httpd 8

.It Ic listen on Ar address Oo Ic tls Oc Ic port Ar number
Set the listen address and port.
This statement can be specified multiple times.
.It Ic location Ar path Brq ...
Specify server configuration rules for a specific location.
The
.Ar path
argument will be matched against the request path with shell globbing rules.
A location section may include most of the server configuration rules
except
.Ic connection ,
.Ic listen on ,
.Ic location
and
.Ic tcp .
.It Oo Ic no Oc Ic log Op Ar option
Set the specified logging options.
Logging is enabled by default using the standard

Valid options are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds

and
.Cm combined
write a log entry after each request similar to the standard Apache
and nginx access log formats.
The style
.Cm connection
writes a summarized log entry after each connection,
that can have multiple requests,
similar to the format that is used by
.Xr relayd 8 .
If not specified, the default is
.Cm common .
.It Oo Ic no Oc Ic syslog
Enable or disable logging to
.Xr syslog 3
instead of the log files.
.El

root directory of
.Nm httpd .
If not specified, it defaults to
.Pa /htdocs .
.It Ic strip Ar number
Strip
.Ar number
path components from the beginning of the request path before looking
up the stripped-down path at the document root.

.Va kern.somaxconn
.Xr sysctl 8
variable.
.It Ic ip minttl Ar number

with a TTL lower than the specified value.
This can be used to implement the
Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM)
according to RFC 5082.
.It Ic ip ttl Ar number
Change the default time-to-live value in the IP headers.
.It Oo Ic no Oc Ic nodelay
Enable the TCP NODELAY option for this connection.
This is recommended to avoid delays in the data stream.
.It Oo Ic no Oc Ic sack
Use selective acknowledgements for this connection.
.It Ic socket buffer Ar number
Set the socket-level buffer size for input and output for this
connection.
This will affect the TCP window size.
.El

The
.Ar file
should contain a PEM encoded certificate.
.It Ic ciphers Ar string
Specify the TLS cipher string.
If not specified, the default value
.Qq HIGH:!aNULL
will be used (strong crypto cipher suites without anonymous DH).
See the CIPHERS section of
.Xr openssl 1
for information about SSL/TLS cipher suites and preference lists.
.It Ic key Ar file
Specify the private key to use for this server.
The
.Ar file
should contain a PEM encoded private key and reside outside of the
.Xr chroot 2
root directory of
.Nm httpd .
.El
.El
.Sh TYPES
Configure the supported media types.
.Xr httpd 8
will set the
.Ar Content-Type
of the response header based on the file extension listed in the
.Ic types
section.
If not specified,
.Xr httpd 8
will use built-in media types for
.Ar text/css ,
.Ar text/html ,
.Ar text/plain ,
.Ar image/gif ,
.Ar image/png ,
.Ar image/jpeg ,
and
.Ar application/javascript .
.Pp
The
.Ic types
section must include one or more lines of the following syntax:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar type/subtype Ar name Op Ar name ...
Set the media
.Ar type
and
.Ar subtype
to the specified extension
.Ar name .
One or more names can be specified per line.
Each line may end with an optional semicolon.
.It Ic include Ar file
Include types definitions from an external file, for example
.Pa /usr/share/misc/mime.types .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example will start one server that is pre-forked two
times and is listening on all local IP addresses.
It additionally defines some media types overriding the defaults.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
prefork 2

server "default" {
	listen on * port 80
}

types {
	text/css			css
	text/html			htm html
	text/txt			txt
	image/gif			gif
	image/jpeg			jpg jpeg
	image/png			png
	application/javascript		js
	application/xml			xml
}
.Ed
.Pp
The server can also be configured to only listen on the primary IP
address of the network interface that is a member of the
.Qq egress
group.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
server "default" {
	listen on egress port 80
}
.Ed
.Pp
Multiple servers can be configured to support hosting of different domains.
If the same address is repeated multiple times in the
.Ic listen on
statement,
the server will be matched based on the requested host name.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
server "www.example.com" {
	alias "example.com"
	listen on * port 80
	listen on * tls port 443
	root "/htdocs/www.example.com"
}

server "www.a.example.com" {
	listen on 203.0.113.1 port 80
	root "/htdocs/www.a.example.com"
}

server "www.b.example.com" {
	listen on 203.0.113.1 port 80
	root "/htdocs/www.b.example.com"
}

server "intranet.example.com" {
	listen on 10.0.0.1 port 80
	root "/htdocs/intranet.example.com"
}
.Ed
.Pp
The syntax of the types section is also compatible with the format used by nginx,
so it is possible to include its
.Pa mime.types
file directly:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
include "/etc/nginx/mime.types"
