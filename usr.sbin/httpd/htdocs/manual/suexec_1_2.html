This section describes the configuration and installation of
the suEXEC feature with the "<CODE>src/Configure</CODE>" script.

(If you use Apache 1.3 you may want to use the Apache
AutoConf-style interface (APACI) which is described in the

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<STRONG>COMPILING THE SUEXEC WRAPPER</STRONG><BR>
You now need to compile the suEXEC wrapper.  At the shell command prompt,
after compiling Apache, 
type:&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG><CODE>make suexec[ENTER]</CODE></STRONG>.
This should create the <STRONG><EM>suexec</EM></STRONG> wrapper executable.
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<STRONG>COMPILING APACHE FOR USE WITH SUEXEC</STRONG><BR>
By default, Apache is compiled to look for the suEXEC wrapper in the following
location.
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<EM>From src/include/httpd.h</EM>
<PRE>
     /* The path to the suExec wrapper, can be overridden in Configuration */
     #ifndef SUEXEC_BIN
     #define SUEXEC_BIN  HTTPD_ROOT "/sbin/suexec"
     #endif
</PRE>
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
If your installation requires location of the wrapper program in a different
directory, either add
<CODE>-DSUEXEC_BIN=\"<EM>&lt;/your/path/to/suexec&gt;</EM>\"</CODE>
to your CFLAGS (or edit src/include/httpd.h) and recompile your Apache server.
See <A HREF="install.html">Compiling and Installing Apache</A>
(and the <SAMP>INSTALL</SAMP> file in the source distribution)
for more info on this process.
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<STRONG>COPYING THE SUEXEC BINARY TO ITS PROPER LOCATION</STRONG><BR>
Copy the <STRONG><EM>suexec</EM></STRONG> executable created in the
exercise above to the defined location for <STRONG>SUEXEC_BIN</STRONG>.
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<STRONG><CODE>cp suexec /usr/local/apache/sbin/suexec [ENTER]</CODE></STRONG>
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
In order for the wrapper to set the user ID, it must be installed as owner
<STRONG><EM>root</EM></STRONG> and must have the setuserid execution bit
set for file modes.  If you are not running a <STRONG><EM>root</EM></STRONG>
user shell, do so now and execute the following commands.
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<STRONG><CODE>chown root /usr/local/apache/sbin/suexec [ENTER]</CODE></STRONG>
<BR>
<STRONG><CODE>chmod 4711 /usr/local/apache/sbin/suexec [ENTER]</CODE></STRONG>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="enable">Enabling &amp; Disabling suEXEC</A></H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
After properly installing the <STRONG>suexec</STRONG> wrapper
executable, you must kill and restart the Apache server.  A simple
<STRONG><CODE>kill -1 `cat httpd.pid`</CODE></STRONG> will not be enough.
Upon startup of the web-server, if Apache finds a properly configured
<STRONG>suexec</STRONG> wrapper, it will print the following message to
the console (Apache 1.2):
<PRE>
    Configuring Apache for use with suexec wrapper.
</PRE>
If you use Apache 1.3 the following message is printed to the
error log:
<PRE>
    [notice] suEXEC mechanism enabled (wrapper: <EM>/path/to/suexec</EM>)
</PRE>
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
If you don't see this message at server startup, the server is most
likely not finding the wrapper program where it expects it, or the
executable is not installed <STRONG><EM>setuid root</EM></STRONG>. Check
your installation and try again.
