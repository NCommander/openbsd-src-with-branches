<H3><A NAME="what">What is suEXEC?</A></H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
The <STRONG>suEXEC</STRONG> feature -- introduced in Apache 1.2 -- provides
Apache users the ability to run <STRONG>CGI</STRONG> and <STRONG>SSI</STRONG>
programs under user IDs different from the user ID of the calling web-server.
Normally, when a CGI or SSI program executes, it runs as the same user who is
running the web server.
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Used properly, this feature can reduce considerably the security risks involved
with allowing users to develop and run private CGI or SSI programs.  However,
if suEXEC is improperly configured, it can cause any number of problems and
possibly create new holes in your computer's security.  If you aren't familiar
with managing setuid root programs and the security issues they present, we
highly recommend that you not consider using suEXEC.
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">

<H3><A NAME="before">Before we begin.</A></H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Before jumping head-first into this document, you should be aware of the
assumptions made on the part of the Apache Group and this document.
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
First, it is assumed that you are using a UNIX derivate operating system that
is capable of <STRONG>setuid</STRONG> and <STRONG>setgid</STRONG> operations.
All command examples are given in this regard.  Other platforms, if they are
capable of supporting suEXEC, may differ in their configuration.
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Second, it is assumed you are familiar with some basic concepts of your
computer's security and its administration.  This involves an understanding
of <STRONG>setuid/setgid</STRONG> operations and the various effects they
may have on your system and its level of security.
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Third, it is assumed that you are using an <STRONG>unmodified</STRONG>
version of suEXEC code.  All code for suEXEC has been carefully scrutinized and
tested by the developers as well as numerous beta testers.  Every precaution
has been taken to ensure a simple yet solidly safe base of code.  Altering this
code can cause unexpected problems and new security risks.  It is
<STRONG>highly</STRONG> recommended you not alter the suEXEC code unless you
are well versed in the particulars of security programming and are willing to
share your work with the Apache Group for consideration.
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Fourth, and last, it has been the decision of the Apache Group to
<STRONG>NOT</STRONG> make suEXEC part of the default installation of Apache.
To this end, suEXEC configuration requires of the administrator careful
attention to details.  After due consideration has been given to the various
settings for suEXEC, the administrator may install suEXEC through normal
installation methods. The values for these settings need to be carefully
determined and specified by the administrator to properly maintain system
security during the use of suEXEC functionality.  It is through this detailed
process that the Apache Group hopes to limit suEXEC installation only to those
who are careful and determined enough to use it.
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Still with us?  Yes?  Good.  Let's move on!
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">
<STRONG><A HREF="suexec.html">BACK TO CONTENTS</A></STRONG>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="model">suEXEC Security Model</A></H3>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Before we begin configuring and installing suEXEC, we will first discuss
the security model you are about to implement.  By doing so, you may
better understand what exactly is going on inside suEXEC and what precautions
are taken to ensure your system's security.
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<STRONG>suEXEC</STRONG> is based on a setuid "wrapper" program that is
called by the main Apache web server.  This wrapper is called when an HTTP
request is made for a CGI or SSI program that the administrator has designated
to run as a userid other than that of the main server.  When such a request
is made, Apache provides the suEXEC wrapper with the program's name and the
user and group IDs under which the program is to execute.
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
The wrapper then employs the following process to determine success or
failure -- if any one of these conditions fail, the program logs the failure
and exits with an error, otherwise it will continue:
<OL>
 <LI><STRONG>Was the wrapper called with the proper number of
  arguments?</STRONG>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   The wrapper will only execute if it is given the proper number of arguments.
   The proper argument format is known to the Apache web server.  If the
   wrapper
   is not receiving the proper number of arguments, it is either being hacked,
   or
   there is something wrong with the suEXEC portion of your Apache binary.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
 </LI>
 <LI><STRONG>Is the user executing this wrapper a valid user of this
  system?</STRONG>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   This is to ensure that the user executing the wrapper is truly a user of the
   system.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
 </LI>
 <LI><STRONG>Is this valid user allowed to run the wrapper?</STRONG>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   Is this user the user allowed to run this wrapper?  Only one user (the
   Apache user) is allowed to execute this program.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
 </LI>
 <LI><STRONG>Does the target program have an unsafe hierarchical
  reference?</STRONG>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   Does the target program contain a leading '/' or have a '..' backreference? 
   These are not allowed; the target program must reside within the Apache

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   Does the target group exist?
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
 </LI>
 <LI><STRONG>Is the target user <EM>NOT</EM> superuser?</STRONG>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   Presently, suEXEC does not allow 'root' to execute CGI/SSI programs.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
 </LI>
 <LI><STRONG>Is the target userid <EM>ABOVE</EM> the minimum ID
  number?</STRONG>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   The minimum user ID number is specified during configuration.  This allows
   you
   to set the lowest possible userid that will be allowed to execute CGI/SSI
   programs.  This is useful to block out "system" accounts.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
 </LI>
 <LI><STRONG>Is the target group <EM>NOT</EM> the superuser group?</STRONG>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   Presently, suEXEC does not allow the 'root' group to execute CGI/SSI
   programs.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
 </LI>
 <LI><STRONG>Is the target groupid <EM>ABOVE</EM> the minimum ID
  number?</STRONG>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   The minimum group ID number is specified during configuration.  This allows
   you
   to set the lowest possible groupid that will be allowed to execute CGI/SSI
   programs.  This is useful to block out "system" groups.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
 </LI>
 <LI><STRONG>Can the wrapper successfully become the target user and
  group?</STRONG>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   Here is where the program becomes the target user and group via setuid and
   setgid
   calls.  The group access list is also initialized with all of the groups
   of which
   the user is a member.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
 </LI>
 <LI><STRONG>Does the directory in which the program resides exist?</STRONG>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   If it doesn't exist, it can't very well contain files.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
 </LI>
 <LI><STRONG>Is the directory within the Apache webspace?</STRONG>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   If the request is for a regular portion of the server, is the requested
   directory
   within the server's document root?  If the request is for a UserDir, is
   the requested
   directory within the user's document root?
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
 </LI>
 <LI><STRONG>Is the directory <EM>NOT</EM> writable by anyone else?</STRONG>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   We don't want to open up the directory to others; only the owner user
   may be able
   to alter this directories contents.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
 </LI>
 <LI><STRONG>Does the target program exist?</STRONG>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   If it doesn't exists, it can't very well be executed.
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
 </LI>
 <LI><STRONG>Is the target program <EM>NOT</EM> writable by anyone

   We do not want to execute programs that will then change our UID/GID again.

  user/group?</STRONG>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   Is the user the owner of the file?
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
 </LI>
 <LI><STRONG>Can we successfully clean the process environment to
  ensure safe operations?</STRONG>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   suEXEC cleans the process' environment by establishing a safe
   execution PATH (defined
   during configuration), as well as only passing through those
   variables whose names
   are listed in the safe environment list (also created during
   configuration).

This is the standard operation of the the suEXEC wrapper's security model.
It is somewhat stringent and can impose new limitations and guidelines for
CGI/SSI design, but it was developed carefully step-by-step with security
in mind.

<STRONG>COMPILING THE SUEXEC WRAPPER</STRONG><BR>
You now need to compile the suEXEC wrapper.  At the shell command prompt,
after compiling Apache, 
type:&nbsp;&nbsp;<STRONG><CODE>make suexec[ENTER]</CODE></STRONG>.
This should create the <STRONG><EM>suexec</EM></STRONG> wrapper executable.
</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<STRONG>COMPILING APACHE FOR USE WITH SUEXEC</STRONG><BR>
By default, Apache is compiled to look for the suEXEC wrapper in the following
location.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<EM>From src/include/httpd.h</EM>
<PRE>
     /* The path to the suExec wrapper, can be overridden in Configuration */
     #ifndef SUEXEC_BIN
     #define SUEXEC_BIN  HTTPD_ROOT "/sbin/suexec"

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
If your installation requires location of the wrapper program in a different
directory, either add
<CODE>-DSUEXEC_BIN=\"<EM>&lt;/your/path/to/suexec&gt;</EM>\"</CODE>
to your CFLAGS (or edit src/include/httpd.h) and recompile your Apache server.
See <A HREF="install.html">Compiling and Installing Apache</A>
(and the <SAMP>INSTALL</SAMP> file in the source distribution)
for more info on this process.

In order for the wrapper to set the user ID, it must me installed as owner

After properly installing the <STRONG>suexec</STRONG> wrapper
executable, you must kill and restart the Apache server.  A simple
<STRONG><CODE>kill -1 `cat httpd.pid`</CODE></STRONG> will not be enough.
Upon startup of the web-server, if Apache finds a properly configured
<STRONG>suexec</STRONG> wrapper, it will print the following message to
the console:

your installation and try again.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
One way to use <STRONG>suEXEC</STRONG> is through the
<A HREF="mod/core.html#user"><STRONG>User</STRONG></A> and
<A HREF="mod/core.html#group"><STRONG>Group</STRONG></A> directives in
<A HREF="mod/core.html#virtualhost"><STRONG>VirtualHost</STRONG></A>
definitions. By setting these directives to values different from the
main server user ID, all requests for CGI resources will be executed as
the <STRONG>User</STRONG> and <STRONG>Group</STRONG> defined for that
<STRONG>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</STRONG>. If only one or
neither of these directives are specified for a
<STRONG>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</STRONG> then the main
server userid is assumed.<P>

<STRONG>suEXEC</STRONG> can also be used to to execute CGI programs as
the user to which the request is being directed. This is accomplished by
using the <STRONG>~</STRONG> character prefixing the user ID for whom
execution is desired.
The only requirement needed for this feature to work is for CGI
execution to be enabled for the user and that the script must meet the

        <LI>Hierarchy limitations
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
        For security and efficiency reasons, all suexec requests must
        remain within either a top-level document root for virtual
        host requests, or one top-level personal document root for
        userdir requests.  For example, if you have four VirtualHosts
        configured, you would need to structure all of your VHosts'
        document roots off of one main Apache document hierarchy to
        take advantage of suEXEC for VirtualHosts. (Example forthcoming.)
