    <p>This document explains how to install, configure and run
    Apache 1.3 under Microsoft Windows. Most of this document
    assumes that you are installing Windows from a binary
    distribution. If you want to compile Apache yourself (possibly
    to help with development, or to track down bugs), see <a
    href="win_compiling.html">Compiling Apache for Microsoft
    Windows</a>.</p>

    <p>If you find any bugs, please document them on our <a

    <p><strong>Warning: Apache on NT has not yet been optimized for
    performance.</strong> Apache still performs best, and is most
    reliable on Unix platforms. Over time NT performance has
    improved, and great progress is being made in the upcoming
    version 2.0 of Apache for the Windows platforms. Folks doing
    comparative reviews of webserver performance are still asked to
    compare against Apache on a Unix platform such as Solaris,
    FreeBSD, or Linux.</p>

    <h2><a id="req" name="req">Requirements</a></h2>

    <p>Apache 1.3 is designed to run on Windows NT 4.0 and Windows
    2000. The binary installer will only work with the x86 family
    of processors, such as Intel's. Apache may also run on Windows
    95 and 98, but these have not been tested. In all cases TCP/IP
    networking must be installed.</p>

    <p>If running on NT 4.0, installing Service Pack 3 or 6 is
    recommended, as Service Pack 4 created known issues with
    TCP/IP and WinSock integrity that were resolved in Service
    Pack 5 and later.</p>

    <p><strong>Note: "Winsock2" is required for Apache 1.3.7 and
    later.</strong></p>

    <p>If running on Windows 95, the "Winsock2" upgrade must be
    installed before Apache will run. "Winsock2" for Windows 95 is
    available <a
    href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/contents/WUAdminTools/S_WUNetworkingTools/W95Sockets2/Default.asp">
    here</a> or via <a
    href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/">here</a>.
    Be warned that the Dialup Networking 1.2 (MS DUN) updates
    include a Winsock2 that is entirely insufficient, and the
    Winsock2 update must be reinstalled after installing Windows 95
    dialup networking.  Windows 98, NT (Service Pack 3 or later) and
    2000 users need to take no special action, those versions provide
    Winsock2 as distributed.</p>

    <h2><a id="down" name="down">Downloading Apache for
    Windows</a></h2>

    <p>Information on the latest version of Apache can be found on
    the Apache web server at <a
    href="http://httpd.apache.org/">http://httpd.apache.org/</a>.
    This will list the current release, any more recent alpha or
    beta-test releases, together with details of mirror web and
    anonymous FTP sites.</p>

    <p>You should download the binary build of Apache for Windows
    named as <code>apache_1_3_#-win32-src.msi</code> if you are
    interested in the source code, or simply
    <code>apache_1_3_#-win32-no_src.msi</code> if you don't plan to
    do anything with the source code and appreciate a faster
    download. Each of these files contains the complete Apache
    runtime. You must have the Microsoft Installer version 1.10
    installed on your PC before you can install the Apache runtime
    distributions. Windows 2000 and Windows ME are both delivered
    with the Microsoft Installer support, others will need to
    download it. Instructions on locating the Microsoft Installer,
    as well as the binary distributions of Apache, are found at 
    <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/"
      >http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/</a></p>

    <p>The source code is available in the <code>-src.msi</code>
    distribution, or from the
    <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/"
      >http://httpd.apache.org/dist/httpd/</a>
    distribution directory as a <code>.zip</code> file. If you plan
    on compiling Apache yourself, there is no need to install
    either <code>.msi</code> package. The <code>.zip</code> file
    contains only source code, with MS-DOS line endings (that is
    cr/lf line endings, instead of the single lf used for Unix
    files distributed in .tar.gz or .tar.Z archives.)</p>

    <p>While the source is also available as a <samp>.tar.gz</samp>
    <samp>.tar.Z</samp> archive, these contain unix lf line endings
    that cause grief for Windows users. To use those archives, you
    must convert at least the <samp>.mak</samp> and
    <samp>.dsp</samp> files to have DOS line endings before MSVC
    can understand them. Please stick with the <samp>.zip</samp>
    file to spare yourself the headache.</p>

    <p>Note: prior to 1.3.17 Apache was distributed as an
    InstallShield 2.0 <samp>.exe</samp> file. With an increasing
    number of users unable to run the InstallShield package [on
    Windows ME or Windows 2000] the binaries were repackaged into
    the readily available Microsoft Installer <samp>.msi</samp>
    format.</p>

    <h2><a id="inst" name="inst">Installing Apache for
    Windows</a></h2>

    <p>Run the Apache <samp>.msi</samp> file you downloaded above.
    This will prompt you for:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>whether or not you want to run Apache for all users
      (installing Apache as a Service), or if you want it installed
      to run in a console window when you choose the Start Apache
      shortcut.</li>

      <li>your Server name, Domain name and administrative email
      account.</li>

      <li>the directory to install Apache into (the default is
      <code>C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache</code> although
      you can change this to any other directory you wish)</li>

      <li>the installation type. The "Complete" option installs
      everything, including the source code if you downloaded the
      <samp>-src.msi</samp> package. Choose the "Custom" install if
      you choose not to install the documentation, or the source
      code from that package.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>During the installation, Apache will configure the files in
    the <samp>conf</samp> directory for your chosen installation
    directory. However if any of the files in this directory
    already exist they will <strong>not</strong> be overwritten.
    Instead the new copy of the corresponding file will be left
    with the extension <samp>.default.conf</samp>. So, for example,
    if <samp>conf\httpd.conf</samp> already exists it will not be
    altered, but the version which would have been installed will
    be left in <samp>conf\httpd.default.conf</samp>. After the
    installation has finished you should manually check to see what
    in new in the <samp>.default.conf</samp> file, and if necessary
    update your existing configuration files.</p>

    <p>Also, if you already have a file called
    <samp>htdocs\index.html</samp> then it will not be overwritten
    (no <samp>index.html.default</samp> file will be installed
    either). This should mean it is safe to install Apache over an
    existing installation (but you will have to stop the existing
    server running before doing the installation, then start the
    new one after the installation is finished).</p>

    <p>After installing Apache, you should edit the configuration
    files in the <samp>conf</samp> directory as required. These
    files will be configured during the install ready for Apache to
    be run from the directory where it was installed, with the
    documents served from the subdirectory <samp>htdocs</samp>.
    There are lots of other options which should be set before you
    start really using Apache. However to get started quickly the
    files should work as installed.</p>

    <p>If you eventually uninstall Apache, your configuration and log 
    files will not be removed. You will need to delete the installation
    directory tree ("C:\Program Files\Apache Group" by default)
    yourself if you do not care to keep your configuration and
    other web files. Since the httpd.conf file is your
    accumulated effort in using Apache, you need to take the effort
    to remove it. The same happens for all other files you may have
    created, as well as any log files Apache created.</p>

    <h2><a id="run" name="run">Running Apache for Windows</a></h2>

    <p>There are two ways you can run Apache:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>As a <a href="win_service.html">"service"</a>. This is
      the best option if you want Apache to automatically start
      when your machine boots, and to keep Apache running when you
      log-off.</li>

      <li>From a <a href="#cmdline">console window</a>. Closing
      this console window will terminate the Apache server.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Complete the steps below before you attempt to start
    Apache as a Windows "<a
    href="win_service.html">service</a>"!</strong></p>

    <p>To run Apache from a console window, select the "Start
    Apache as console app" option from the Start menu (in Apache
    1.3.4 and earlier, this option was called "Apache Server").
    This will open a console window and start Apache running inside
    it. The window will remain active until you stop Apache. To
    stop Apache running, either press select the "Shutdown Apache
    console app" icon option from the Start menu (this is not
    available in Apache 1.3.4 or earlier), or see <a
    href="#signal">Controlling Apache in a Console Window</a> for
    commands to control Apache in a console window.</p>

    <p>In Apache 1.3.13 and above it is now quite safe to press
    Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break to stop the Apache in the console window.
    And on Windows NT/2000 with version 1.3.13, Apache will stop if
    you select 'Close' from the system menu (clicking the icon on
    the top-left corner of the console window) or click the close
    (X) button on the top-right corner. The Close menu item and
    close (X) button also work on Windows 95/98 as of Apache
    version 1.3.15. But do <em>not</em> try any of these approaches
    on earlier versions of the Apache server, since Apache would
    not clean up.</p>

    <h2><a id="test" name="test">Testing Apache for
    Windows</a></h2>

    <p>If you have trouble starting Apache please use the following
    steps to isolate the problem. This applies if you started
    Apache using the "Start Apache as a console app" shortcut from
    the Start menu and the Apache console window closes immediately
    (or unexpectedly) or if you have trouble starting Apache as a
    service.</p>

    <p>Run the "Command Prompt" from the Start Menu - Programs
    list. Change to the folder to which you installed Apache, type
    the command apache, and read the error message. Then review the
    error.log file for configuration mistakes. If you accepted the
    defaults when you installed Apache, the commands would be:</p>
<pre>
  c:
  cd "\program files\apache group\apache"
  apache
  <em>Wait for Apache to exit, or press</em> Ctrl+C
  more &lt;logs\error.log
</pre>

    <p>After looking at the error.log you will probably have a good
    chance of working out what went wrong and be able to fix the
    problem and try again. If you are unable to work it out then
    please follow the <a href="#help">guidelines for assistance</a>
    at the top of this document or in the <a
    href="misc/FAQ.html#what2do">FAQ</a>. Many users discover that
    the nature of the httpd.conf file is easier to manage and audit
    than page after page of configuration dialog boxes.</p>

    <p>After starting Apache running (either in a console window or
    as a service) if will be listening to port 80 (unless you
    changed the <samp>Port</samp>, <samp>Listen</samp> or
    <samp>BindAddress</samp> directives in the configuration
    files). To connect to the server and access the default page,
    launch a browser and enter this URL:</p>
<pre>
  http://localhost/
</pre>

    <p>This should respond with a welcome page, and a link to the
    Apache manual. If nothing happens or you get an error, look in
    the <samp>error.log</samp> file in the <samp>logs</samp>
    directory. If your host isn't connected to the net, you may
    have to use this URL:</p>
<pre>
  http://127.0.0.1/
</pre>

    <p>Once your basic installation is working, you should
    configure it properly by editing the files in the
    <samp>conf</samp> directory.</p>

    <p>Because Apache <em>CANNOT</em> share the same port with
    another TCP/IP application, you may need to stop or uninstall
    certain services first. These include (but are not limited to)
    other web servers, and firewall products such as BlackIce. If
    you can only start Apache with these services disabled,
    reconfigure either Apache or the other product so that they do
    not listen on the same TCP/IP ports. You may find the Windows
    "netstat -an" command useful in finding out what ports are in
    use.</p>

    <h2><a id="use" name="use">Configuring Apache for
    Windows</a></h2>

    <p>Apache is configured by files in the <samp>conf</samp>
    directory. These are the same as files used to configure the
    Unix version, but there are a few different directives for
    Apache on Windows. See the <a href="./">Apache
    documentation</a> for all the available directives.</p>

    <p>Begin configuring the Apache server by reviewing
    <code>httpd.conf</code> and its directives. Although the files
    <code>access.conf</code> and <code>srm.conf</code> both exist,
    these are old files which are no longer used by most
    administrators, and you will find no directives there.</p>

    <p><code>httpd.conf</code> contains a great deal of
    documentation itself, followed by the default configuration
    directives recommended when starting with the Apache server.
    Begin by reading these comments to understand the configuration
    file, and make small changes, starting Apache in a console
    window with each change. If you make a mistake, it will be
    easier to back up to configuration that last worked. You will
    have a better idea of which change caused the server to
    fail.</p>

    <p>The main differences in Apache for Windows are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Because Apache for Windows is multithreaded, it does not
        use a separate process for each request, as Apache does
        with Unix. Instead there are usually only two Apache
        processes running: a parent process, and a child which
        handles the requests. Within the child each request is
        handled by a separate thread. So, "process"-management
        directives are different: 

        <ul>
          <li><a
          href="mod/core.html#maxrequestsperchild">MaxRequestsPerChild</a>
          - Like the Unix directive, this controls how many
          requests a process will serve before exiting. However,
          unlike Unix, a process serves all the requests at once,
          not just one, so if this is set, it is recommended that a
          very high number is used. The recommended default,
          <code>MaxRequestsPerChild 0</code>, does not cause the
          process to ever exit.</li>

          <li><a
          href="mod/core.html#threadsperchild">ThreadsPerChild</a>
          - This directive is new, and tells the server how many
          threads it should use. This is the maximum number of
          connections the server can handle at once; be sure and
          set this number high enough for your site if you get a
          lot of hits. The recommended default is
          <code>ThreadsPerChild 50</code>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>The directives that accept filenames as arguments now
      must use Windows filenames instead of Unix ones. However,
      because Apache uses Unix-style names internally, you must use
      forward slashes, not backslashes. Drive letters can be used;
      if omitted, the drive with the Apache executable will be
      assumed.</li>

      <li>
        Apache for Windows has the ability to load modules at
        runtime, without recompiling the server. If Apache is
        compiled normally, it will install a number of optional
        modules in the <code>modules</code> directory. To activate
        these, or other modules, the new <a
        href="mod/mod_so.html#loadmodule">LoadModule</a> directive
        must be used. For example, to activate the status module, use
        the following (in addition to the status-activating
        directives in <code>httpd.conf</code> - see <a
        href="mod/mod_status.html">the mod_status docs</a> for more
        details.): 
<pre>
    LoadModule status_module modules/mod_status.so
</pre>

        <p>Information on <a
        href="mod/mod_so.html#creating">creating loadable
        modules</a> is also available. Note that some 3rd party
        modules may be distributed in the old style names,
        ApacheModuleFoo.dll. Always set the LoadModule command as
        directed by the 3rd party module's own documentation.</p>
      </li>

      <li>Apache for Windows version 1.3 series is implemented in
      synchronous calls. This poses an enormous problem for CGI
      authors, who won't see unbuffered results sent immediately to
      the browser. This is not the behavior described for CGI in
      Apache, but it is a side-effect of the Windows port. Apache
      2.0 is making progress to implement the expected asynchronous
      behavior, and we hope to discover that the NT/2000
      implementation allows CGI's to behave as documented.</li>

      <li>
        <p>Apache can also load ISAPI Extensions (<em>i.e.</em>,
        Internet Server Applications), such as those used by
        Microsoft's IIS, and other Windows servers. <a
        href="mod/mod_isapi.html">More information is
        available.</a> Note that Apache <em>CANNOT</em> load ISAPI
        Filters.</p>
      </li>

      <li>When running CGI scripts, the method Apache uses to find
      the interpreter for the script is configurable using the <a
      href="mod/core.html#scriptinterpretersource">ScriptInterpreterSource</a>
      directive.</li>

      <li>Since it is often difficult to manage files with names
      like <code>.htaccess</code> under windows, you may find it
      useful to change the name of this configuration file using
      the <a href="mod/core.html#accessfilename">AccessFilename</a>
      directive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a id="cmdline" name="cmdline">Running Apache in a Console
    Window</a></h2>

    <p>The Start menu icons and the NT Service manager can provide
    a simple interface for administering Apache. But in some cases
    it is easier to work from the command line.</p>

    <p>When working with Apache it is important to know how it will
    find the configuration files. You can specify a configuration
    file on the command line in two ways:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>-f specifies a path to a particular configuration
      file:</li>
    </ul>
<pre>
    apache -f "c:\my server\conf\my.conf"
</pre>
<pre>
    apache -f test\test.conf
</pre>

    <ul>
      <li>-n specifies the configuration file of an installed
      Apache service (Apache 1.3.7 and later):</li>
    </ul>
<pre>
    apache -n "service name"
</pre>

    <p>In these cases, the proper ServerRoot should be set in the
    configuration file.</p>

    <p>If you don't specify a configuration file name with -f or
    -n, Apache will use the file name compiled into the server,
    usually "conf/httpd.conf". Invoking Apache with the -V switch
    will display this value labeled as SERVER_CONFIG_FILE. Apache
    will then determine its ServerRoot by trying the following, in
    this order:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A ServerRoot directive via a -C switch.</li>

      <li>The -d switch on the command line.</li>

      <li>The current working directory</li>

      <li>A registry entry, created if you did a binary
      install.</li>

      <li>The server root compiled into the server.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The server root compiled into the server is usually
    "/apache". invoking apache with the -V switch will display this
    value labeled as HTTPD_ROOT.</p>

    <p>When invoked from the start menu, Apache is usually passed
    no arguments, so using the registry entry is the preferred
    technique for console Apache.</p>

    <p>During a binary installation, a registry key will have been
    installed, for example:</p>
<pre>
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Apache Group\Apache\1.3.13\ServerRoot
</pre>

    <p>This key is compiled into the server and can enable you to
    test new versions without affecting the current version. Of
    course you must take care not to install the new version on top
    of the old version in the file system.</p>

    <p>If you did not do a binary install then Apache will in some
    scenarios complain about the missing registry key. This warning
    can be ignored if it otherwise was able to find its
    configuration files.</p>

    <p>The value of this key is the "ServerRoot" directory,
    containing the <samp>conf</samp> directory. When Apache starts
    it will read the <samp>httpd.conf</samp> file from this
    directory. If this file contains a <samp>ServerRoot</samp>
    directive which is different from the directory obtained from
    the registry key above, Apache will forget the registry key and
    use the directory from the configuration file. If you copy the
    Apache directory or configuration files to a new location it is
    vital that you update the <samp>ServerRoot</samp> directory in
    the <samp>httpd.conf</samp> file to the new location.</p>

    <p>To run Apache from the command line as a console
    application, use the following command:</p>
<pre>
    apache 
</pre>

    <p>Apache will execute, and will remain running until it is
    stopped by pressing control-C.</p>

    <h2><a id="signal" name="signal">Controlling Apache in a
    Console Window</a></h2>

    <p>You can tell a running Apache to stop by opening another
    console window and running:</p>
<pre>
    apache -k shutdown
</pre>

    <p><strong>Note: This option is only available with Apache
    1.3.3 and later.</strong></p>

    <p>For earlier versions, you must use Control-C in the Apache
    console window to shut down the server.</p>

    <p>From version 1.3.3 through 1.3.12, this should be used
    instead of pressing Control-C in a running Apache console
    window, because it allowed Apache to end any current
    transactions and cleanup gracefully.</p>

    <p>As of version 1.3.13 pressing Control-C in the running
    window will cleanup Apache quite gracefully, and you may use -k
    stop as an alias for -k shutdown. Earlier versions do not
    understand -k stop.</p>

    <p>You can also tell Apache to restart. This makes it re-read
    the configuration files. Any transactions in progress are
    allowed to complete without interruption. To restart Apache,
    run:</p>
<pre>
    apache -k restart
</pre>

    <p><strong>Note: This option is only available with Apache
    1.3.3 and later. For earlier versions, you need to use
    Control-C in the Apache console window to shut down the server,
    and then restart the server with the Apache
    command.</strong></p>

    <p>Another <em>very useful</em> feature is the configuration
    files test option. To test the Apache configuration files,
    run:</p>
<pre>
    apache -t
</pre>

    <p>This is especially useful following alterations to the
    configuration files while Apache is still running. You can make
    the changes, confirm that the syntax is good by issuing the
    "apache -t" command, then restart Apache with "apache -k
    restart". Apache will re-read the configuration files, allowing
    any transactions in progress to complete without interruption.
    Any new request will then be served using the new
    configuration.</p>

    <p>Note: for people familiar with the Unix version of Apache,
    these commands provide a Windows equivalent to <code>kill -TERM
    <em>pid</em></code> and <code>kill -USR1 <em>pid</em></code>.
    The command line option used, <code>-k</code>, was chosen as a
    reminder of the "kill" command used on Unix.</p>
