    <h1 align="CENTER">An In-Depth Discussion of VirtualHost
    Matching</h1>

    <p>This is a very rough document that was probably out of date
    the moment it was written. It attempts to explain exactly what
    the code does when deciding what virtual host to serve a hit
    from. It's provided on the assumption that something is better
    than nothing. The server version under discussion is Apache
    1.2.</p>

    <p>If you just want to "make it work" without understanding
    how, there's a <a href="#whatworks">What Works</a> section at
    the bottom.</p>

    <h3>Config File Parsing</h3>

    <p>There is a main_server which consists of all the definitions
    appearing outside of <code>VirtualHost</code> sections. There
    are virtual servers, called <em>vhosts</em>, which are defined
    by <a
    href="../mod/core.html#virtualhost"><samp>VirtualHost</samp></a>
    sections.</p>

    <p>The directives <a
    href="../mod/core.html#port"><samp>Port</samp></a>, <a
    href="../mod/core.html#servername"><samp>ServerName</samp></a>,
    <a
    href="../mod/core.html#serverpath"><samp>ServerPath</samp></a>,
    and <a
    href="../mod/core.html#serveralias"><samp>ServerAlias</samp></a>
    can appear anywhere within the definition of a server. However,
    each appearance overrides the previous appearance (within that
    server).</p>

    <p>The default value of the <code>Port</code> field for
    main_server is 80. The main_server has no default
    <code>ServerName</code>, <code>ServerPath</code>, or
    <code>ServerAlias</code>.</p>

    <p>In the absence of any <a
    href="../mod/core.html#listen"><samp>Listen</samp></a>
    directives, the (final if there are multiple) <code>Port</code>
    directive in the main_server indicates which port httpd will
    listen on.</p>

    <p>The <code>Port</code> and <code>ServerName</code> directives
    for any server main or virtual are used when generating URLs
    such as during redirects.</p>

    <p>Each address appearing in the <code>VirtualHost</code>
    directive can have an optional port. If the port is unspecified
    it defaults to the value of the main_server's most recent
    <code>Port</code> statement. The special port <samp>*</samp>
    indicates a wildcard that matches any port. Collectively the
    entire set of addresses (including multiple <samp>A</samp>
    record results from DNS lookups) are called the vhost's
    <em>address set</em>.</p>

    <p>The magic <code>_default_</code> address has significance
    during the matching algorithm. It essentially matches any
    unspecified address.</p>

    <p>After parsing the <code>VirtualHost</code> directive, the
    vhost server is given a default <code>Port</code> equal to the
    port assigned to the first name in its <code>VirtualHost</code>
    directive. The complete list of names in the
    <code>VirtualHost</code> directive are treated just like a
    <code>ServerAlias</code> (but are not overridden by any
    <code>ServerAlias</code> statement). Note that subsequent
    <code>Port</code> statements for this vhost will not affect the
    ports assigned in the address set.</p>

    <p>All vhosts are stored in a list which is in the reverse
    order that they appeared in the config file. For example, if
    the config file is:</p>

    <blockquote>
<pre>
    &lt;VirtualHost A&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

    &lt;VirtualHost B&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

    &lt;VirtualHost C&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    Then the list will be ordered: main_server, C, B, A. Keep this
    in mind. 

    <p>After parsing has completed, the list of servers is scanned,
    and various merges and default values are set. In
    particular:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>If a vhost has no <a
      href="../mod/core.html#serveradmin"><code>ServerAdmin</code></a>,
      <a
      href="../mod/core.html#resourceconfig"><code>ResourceConfig</code></a>,
      <a
      href="../mod/core.html#accessconfig"><code>AccessConfig</code></a>,
      <a href="../mod/core.html#timeout"><code>Timeout</code></a>,
      <a
      href="../mod/core.html#keepalivetimeout"><code>KeepAliveTimeout</code></a>,
      <a
      href="../mod/core.html#keepalive"><code>KeepAlive</code></a>,
      <a
      href="../mod/core.html#maxkeepaliverequests"><code>MaxKeepAliveRequests</code></a>,
      or <a
      href="../mod/core.html#sendbuffersize"><code>SendBufferSize</code></a>
      directive then the respective value is inherited from the
      main_server. (That is, inherited from whatever the final
      setting of that value is in the main_server.)</li>

      <li>The "lookup defaults" that define the default directory
      permissions for a vhost are merged with those of the main
      server. This includes any per-directory configuration
      information for any module.</li>

      <li>The per-server configs for each module from the
      main_server are merged into the vhost server.</li>
    </ol>
    Essentially, the main_server is treated as "defaults" or a
    "base" on which to build each vhost. But the positioning of
    these main_server definitions in the config file is largely
    irrelevant -- the entire config of the main_server has been
    parsed when this final merging occurs. So even if a main_server
    definition appears after a vhost definition it might affect the
    vhost definition. 

    <p>If the main_server has no <code>ServerName</code> at this
    point, then the hostname of the machine that httpd is running
    on is used instead. We will call the <em>main_server address
    set</em> those IP addresses returned by a DNS lookup on the
    <code>ServerName</code> of the main_server.</p>

    <p>Now a pass is made through the vhosts to fill in any missing
    <code>ServerName</code> fields and to classify the vhost as
    either an <em>IP-based</em> vhost or a <em>name-based</em>
    vhost. A vhost is considered a name-based vhost if any of its
    address set overlaps the main_server (the port associated with
    each address must match the main_server's <code>Port</code>).
    Otherwise it is considered an IP-based vhost.</p>

    <p>For any undefined <code>ServerName</code> fields, a
    name-based vhost defaults to the address given first in the
    <code>VirtualHost</code> statement defining the vhost. Any
    vhost that includes the magic <samp>_default_</samp> wildcard
    is given the same <code>ServerName</code> as the main_server.
    Otherwise the vhost (which is necessarily an IP-based vhost) is
    given a <code>ServerName</code> based on the result of a
    reverse DNS lookup on the first address given in the
    <code>VirtualHost</code> statement.</p>

    <h3>Vhost Matching</h3>

    <p><strong>Apache 1.3 differs from what is documented here, and
    documentation still has to be written.</strong></p>

    <p>The server determines which vhost to use for a request as
    follows:</p>

    <p><code>find_virtual_server</code>: When the connection is
    first made by the client, the local IP address (the IP address
    to which the client connected) is looked up in the server list.
    A vhost is matched if it is an IP-based vhost, the IP address
    matches and the port matches (taking into account
    wildcards).</p>

    <p>If no vhosts are matched then the last occurrence, if it
    appears, of a <samp>_default_</samp> address (which if you
    recall the ordering of the server list mentioned above means
    that this would be the first occurrence of
    <samp>_default_</samp> in the config file) is matched.</p>

    <p>In any event, if nothing above has matched, then the
    main_server is matched.</p>

    <p>The vhost resulting from the above search is stored with
    data about the connection. We'll call this the <em>connection
    vhost</em>. The connection vhost is constant over all requests
    in a particular TCP/IP session -- that is, over all requests in
    a KeepAlive/persistent session.</p>

    <p>For each request made on the connection the following
    sequence of events further determines the actual vhost that
    will be used to serve the request.</p>

    <p><code>check_fulluri</code>: If the requestURI is an
    absoluteURI, that is it includes <code>http://hostname/</code>,
    then an attempt is made to determine if the hostname's address
    (and optional port) match that of the connection vhost. If it
    does then the hostname portion of the URI is saved as the
    <em>request_hostname</em>. If it does not match, then the URI
    remains untouched. <strong>Note</strong>: to achieve this
    address comparison, the hostname supplied goes through a DNS
    lookup unless it matches the <code>ServerName</code> or the
    local IP address of the client's socket.</p>

    <p><code>parse_uri</code>: If the URI begins with a protocol
    (<em>i.e.</em>, <code>http:</code>, <code>ftp:</code>) then the
    request is considered a proxy request. Note that even though we
    may have stripped an <code>http://hostname/</code> in the
    previous step, this could still be a proxy request.</p>

    <p><code>read_request</code>: If the request does not have a
    hostname from the earlier step, then any <code>Host:</code>
    header sent by the client is used as the request hostname.</p>

    <p><code>check_hostalias</code>: If the request now has a
    hostname, then an attempt is made to match for this hostname.
    The first step of this match is to compare any port, if one was
    given in the request, against the <code>Port</code> field of
    the connection vhost. If there's a mismatch then the vhost used
    for the request is the connection vhost. (This is a bug, see
    observations.)</p>

    <p>If the port matches, then httpd scans the list of vhosts
    starting with the next server <strong>after</strong> the
    connection vhost. This scan does not stop if there are any
    matches, it goes through all possible vhosts, and in the end
    uses the last match it found. The comparisons performed are as
    follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Compare the request hostname:port with the vhost
      <code>ServerName</code> and <code>Port</code>.</li>

      <li>Compare the request hostname against any and all
      addresses given in the <code>VirtualHost</code> directive for
      this vhost.</li>

      <li>Compare the request hostname against the
      <code>ServerAlias</code> given for the vhost.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><code>check_serverpath</code>: If the request has no
    hostname (back up a few paragraphs) then a scan similar to the
    one in <code>check_hostalias</code> is performed to match any
    <code>ServerPath</code> directives given in the vhosts. Note
    that the <strong>last match</strong> is used regardless (again
    consider the ordering of the virtual hosts).</p>

    <h3>Observations</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>It is difficult to define an IP-based vhost for the
      machine's "main IP address". You essentially have to create a
      bogus <code>ServerName</code> for the main_server that does
      not match the machine's IPs.</li>

      <li>
        During the scans in both <code>check_hostalias</code> and
        <code>check_serverpath</code> no check is made that the
        vhost being scanned is actually a name-based vhost. This
        means, for example, that it's possible to match an IP-based
        vhost through another address. But because the scan starts
        in the vhost list at the first vhost that matched the local
        IP address of the connection, not all IP-based vhosts can
        be matched. 

        <p>Consider the config file above with three vhosts A, B,
        C. Suppose that B is a named-based vhost, and A and C are
        IP-based vhosts. If a request comes in on B or C's address
        containing a header "<samp>Host: A</samp>" then it will be
        served from A's config. If a request comes in on A's
        address then it will always be served from A's config
        regardless of any Host: header.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Unless you have a <samp>_default_</samp> vhost, it doesn't
        matter if you mix name-based vhosts in amongst IP-based
        vhosts. During the <code>find_virtual_server</code> phase
        above no named-based vhost will be matched, so the
        main_server will remain the connection vhost. Then scans
        will cover all vhosts in the vhost list. 

        <p>If you do have a <samp>_default_</samp> vhost, then you
        cannot place named-based vhosts after it in the config.
        This is because on any connection to the main server IPs
        the connection vhost will always be the
        <samp>_default_</samp> vhost since none of the name-based
        are considered during <code>find_virtual_server</code>.</p>
      </li>

      <li>You should never specify DNS names in
      <code>VirtualHost</code> directives because it will force
      your server to rely on DNS to boot. Furthermore it poses a
      security threat if you do not control the DNS for all the
      domains listed. <a href="dns-caveats.html">There's more
      information available on this and the next two
      topics</a>.</li>

      <li><code>ServerName</code> should always be set for each
      vhost. Otherwise A DNS lookup is required for each
      vhost.</li>

      <li>A DNS lookup is always required for the main_server's
      <code>ServerName</code> (or to generate that if it isn't
      specified in the config).</li>

      <li>If a <code>ServerPath</code> directive exists which is a
      prefix of another <code>ServerPath</code> directive that
      appears later in the configuration file, then the former will
      always be matched and the latter will never be matched. (That
      is assuming that no Host header was available to disambiguate
      the two.)</li>

      <li>If a vhost that would otherwise be a name-vhost includes
      a <code>Port</code> statement that doesn't match the
      main_server <code>Port</code> then it will be considered an
      IP-based vhost. Then <code>find_virtual_server</code> will
      match it (because the ports associated with each address in
      the address set default to the port of the main_server) as
      the connection vhost. Then <code>check_hostalias</code> will
      refuse to check any other name-based vhost because of the
      port mismatch. The result is that the vhost will steal all
      hits going to the main_server address.</li>

      <li>If two IP-based vhosts have an address in common, the
      vhost appearing later in the file is always matched. Such a
      thing might happen inadvertently. If the config has
      name-based vhosts and for some reason the main_server
      <code>ServerName</code> resolves to the wrong address then
      all the name-based vhosts will be parsed as ip-based vhosts.
      Then the last of them will steal all the hits.</li>

      <li>The last name-based vhost in the config is always matched
      for any hit which doesn't match one of the other name-based
      vhosts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a id="whatworks" name="whatworks">What Works</a></h3>

    <p>In addition to the tips on the <a
    href="dns-caveats.html#tips">DNS Issues</a> page, here are some
    further tips:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Place all main_server definitions before any VirtualHost
      definitions. (This is to aid the readability of the
      configuration -- the post-config merging process makes it
      non-obvious that definitions mixed in around virtualhosts
      might affect all virtualhosts.)</li>

      <li>Arrange your VirtualHosts such that all name-based
      virtual hosts come first, followed by IP-based virtual hosts,
      followed by any <samp>_default_</samp> virtual host</li>

      <li>Avoid <code>ServerPaths</code> which are prefixes of
      other <code>ServerPaths</code>. If you cannot avoid this then
      you have to ensure that the longer (more specific) prefix
      vhost appears earlier in the configuration file than the
      shorter (less specific) prefix (<em>i.e.</em>, "ServerPath
      /abc" should appear after "ServerPath /abcdef").</li>

      <li>Do not use <em>port-based</em> vhosts in the same server
      as name-based vhosts. A loose definition for port-based is a
      vhost which is determined by the port on the server
      (<em>i.e.</em>, one server with ports 8000, 8080, and 80 -
      all of which have different configurations).</li>
    </ul>
