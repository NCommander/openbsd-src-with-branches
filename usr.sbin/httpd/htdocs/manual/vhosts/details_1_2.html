<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">An In-Depth Discussion of VirtualHost Matching</H1>

<P>This is a very rough document that was probably out of date the moment
it was written.  It attempts to explain exactly what the code does when
deciding what virtual host to serve a hit from.  It's provided on the
assumption that something is better than nothing.  The server version
under discussion is Apache 1.2.

<P>If you just want to &quot;make it work&quot; without understanding
how, there's a <A HREF="#whatworks">What Works</A> section at the bottom.

<H3>Config File Parsing</H3>

<P>There is a main_server which consists of all the definitions appearing
outside of <CODE>VirtualHost</CODE> sections.  There are virtual servers,
called <EM>vhosts</EM>, which are defined by
<A
 HREF="../mod/core.html#virtualhost"
><SAMP>VirtualHost</SAMP></A>
sections.

<P>The directives
<A
 HREF="../mod/core.html#port"
><SAMP>Port</SAMP></A>,
<A
 HREF="../mod/core.html#servername"
><SAMP>ServerName</SAMP></A>,
<A
 HREF="../mod/core.html#serverpath"
><SAMP>ServerPath</SAMP></A>,
and
<A
 HREF="../mod/core.html#serveralias"
><SAMP>ServerAlias</SAMP></A>
can appear anywhere within the definition of
a server.  However, each appearance overrides the previous appearance
(within that server).

<P>The default value of the <CODE>Port</CODE> field for main_server
is 80.  The main_server has no default <CODE>ServerName</CODE>,
<CODE>ServerPath</CODE>, or <CODE>ServerAlias</CODE>.

<P>In the absence of any
<A
 HREF="../mod/core.html#listen"
><SAMP>Listen</SAMP></A>
directives, the (final if there
are multiple) <CODE>Port</CODE> directive in the main_server indicates
which port httpd will listen on.

<P> The <CODE>Port</CODE> and <CODE>ServerName</CODE> directives for
any server main or virtual are used when generating URLs such as during
redirects.

<P> Each address appearing in the <CODE>VirtualHost</CODE> directive
can have an optional port.  If the port is unspecified it defaults to
the value of the main_server's most recent <CODE>Port</CODE> statement.
The special port <SAMP>*</SAMP> indicates a wildcard that matches any port.
Collectively the entire set of addresses (including multiple
<SAMP>A</SAMP> record
results from DNS lookups) are called the vhost's <EM>address set</EM>.

<P> The magic <CODE>_default_</CODE> address has significance during
the matching algorithm.  It essentially matches any unspecified address.

<P> After parsing the <CODE>VirtualHost</CODE> directive, the vhost server
is given a default <CODE>Port</CODE> equal to the port assigned to the
first name in its <CODE>VirtualHost</CODE> directive.  The complete
list of names in the <CODE>VirtualHost</CODE> directive are treated
just like a <CODE>ServerAlias</CODE> (but are not overridden by any
<CODE>ServerAlias</CODE> statement).  Note that subsequent <CODE>Port</CODE>
statements for this vhost will not affect the ports assigned in the
address set.

<P>
All vhosts are stored in a list which is in the reverse order that
they appeared in the config file.  For example, if the config file is:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
    &lt;VirtualHost A&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

    &lt;VirtualHost B&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

    &lt;VirtualHost C&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Then the list will be ordered: main_server, C, B, A.  Keep this in mind.

<P>
After parsing has completed, the list of servers is scanned, and various
merges and default values are set.  In particular:

<OL>
<LI>If a vhost has no
    <A
     HREF="../mod/core.html#serveradmin"
    ><CODE>ServerAdmin</CODE></A>,
    <A
     HREF="../mod/core.html#resourceconfig"
    ><CODE>ResourceConfig</CODE></A>,
    <A
     HREF="../mod/core.html#accessconfig"
    ><CODE>AccessConfig</CODE></A>,
    <A
     HREF="../mod/core.html#timeout"
    ><CODE>Timeout</CODE></A>,
    <A
     HREF="../mod/core.html#keepalivetimeout"
    ><CODE>KeepAliveTimeout</CODE></A>,
    <A
     HREF="../mod/core.html#keepalive"
    ><CODE>KeepAlive</CODE></A>,
    <A
     HREF="../mod/core.html#maxkeepaliverequests"
    ><CODE>MaxKeepAliveRequests</CODE></A>,
    or
    <A
     HREF="../mod/core.html#sendbuffersize"
    ><CODE>SendBufferSize</CODE></A>
    directive then the respective value is
    inherited from the main_server.  (That is, inherited from whatever
    the final setting of that value is in the main_server.)

<LI>The &quot;lookup defaults&quot; that define the default directory
    permissions
    for a vhost are merged with those of the main server.  This includes
    any per-directory configuration information for any module.

<LI>The per-server configs for each module from the main_server are
    merged into the vhost server.
</OL>

Essentially, the main_server is treated as &quot;defaults&quot; or a
&quot;base&quot; on
which to build each vhost.  But the positioning of these main_server
definitions in the config file is largely irrelevant -- the entire
config of the main_server has been parsed when this final merging occurs.
So even if a main_server definition appears after a vhost definition
it might affect the vhost definition.

<P> If the main_server has no <CODE>ServerName</CODE> at this point,
then the hostname of the machine that httpd is running on is used
instead.  We will call the <EM>main_server address set</EM> those IP
addresses returned by a DNS lookup on the <CODE>ServerName</CODE> of
the main_server.

<P> Now a pass is made through the vhosts to fill in any missing
<CODE>ServerName</CODE> fields and to classify the vhost as either
an <EM>IP-based</EM> vhost or a <EM>name-based</EM> vhost.  A vhost is
considered a name-based vhost if any of its address set overlaps the
main_server (the port associated with each address must match the
main_server's <CODE>Port</CODE>).  Otherwise it is considered an IP-based
vhost.

<P> For any undefined <CODE>ServerName</CODE> fields, a name-based vhost
defaults to the address given first in the <CODE>VirtualHost</CODE>
statement defining the vhost.  Any vhost that includes the magic
<SAMP>_default_</SAMP> wildcard is given the same <CODE>ServerName</CODE> as
the main_server.  Otherwise the vhost (which is necessarily an IP-based
vhost) is given a <CODE>ServerName</CODE> based on the result of a reverse
DNS lookup on the first address given in the <CODE>VirtualHost</CODE>
statement.

<P>

<H3>Vhost Matching</H3>


<P><STRONG>Apache 1.3 differs from what is documented
here, and documentation still has to be written.</STRONG>

<P>
The server determines which vhost to use for a request as follows:

<P> <CODE>find_virtual_server</CODE>: When the connection is first made
by the client, the local IP address (the IP address to which the client
connected) is looked up in the server list.  A vhost is matched if it
is an IP-based vhost, the IP address matches and the port matches
(taking into account wildcards).

<P> If no vhosts are matched then the last occurrence, if it appears,
of a <SAMP>_default_</SAMP> address (which if you recall the ordering of the
server list mentioned above means that this would be the first occurrence
of <SAMP>_default_</SAMP> in the config file) is matched.

<P> In any event, if nothing above has matched, then the main_server is
matched.

<P> The vhost resulting from the above search is stored with data
about the connection.  We'll call this the <EM>connection vhost</EM>.
The connection vhost is constant over all requests in a particular TCP/IP
session -- that is, over all requests in a KeepAlive/persistent session.

<P> For each request made on the connection the following sequence of
events further determines the actual vhost that will be used to serve
the request.

<P> <CODE>check_fulluri</CODE>: If the requestURI is an absoluteURI, that
is it includes <CODE>http://hostname/</CODE>, then an attempt is made to
determine if the hostname's address (and optional port) match that of
the connection vhost.  If it does then the hostname portion of the URI
is saved as the <EM>request_hostname</EM>.  If it does not match, then the
URI remains untouched.  <STRONG>Note</STRONG>: to achieve this address
comparison,
the hostname supplied goes through a DNS lookup unless it matches the
<CODE>ServerName</CODE> or the local IP address of the client's socket.

<P> <CODE>parse_uri</CODE>: If the URI begins with a protocol
(<EM>i.e.</EM>, <CODE>http:</CODE>, <CODE>ftp:</CODE>) then the request is
considered a proxy request.  Note that even though we may have stripped
an <CODE>http://hostname/</CODE> in the previous step, this could still
be a proxy request.

<P> <CODE>read_request</CODE>: If the request does not have a hostname
from the earlier step, then any <CODE>Host:</CODE> header sent by the
client is used as the request hostname.

<P> <CODE>check_hostalias</CODE>: If the request now has a hostname,
then an attempt is made to match for this hostname.  The first step
of this match is to compare any port, if one was given in the request,
against the <CODE>Port</CODE> field of the connection vhost.  If there's
a mismatch then the vhost used for the request is the connection vhost.
(This is a bug, see observations.)

<P>
If the port matches, then httpd scans the list of vhosts starting with
the next server <STRONG>after</STRONG> the connection vhost.  This scan does not
stop if there are any matches, it goes through all possible vhosts,
and in the end uses the last match it found.  The comparisons performed
are as follows:

<UL>
<LI>Compare the request hostname:port with the vhost
    <CODE>ServerName</CODE> and <CODE>Port</CODE>.

<LI>Compare the request hostname against any and all addresses given in
    the <CODE>VirtualHost</CODE> directive for this vhost.

<LI>Compare the request hostname against the <CODE>ServerAlias</CODE>
    given for the vhost.
</UL>

<P>
<CODE>check_serverpath</CODE>: If the request has no hostname
(back up a few paragraphs) then a scan similar to the one
in <CODE>check_hostalias</CODE> is performed to match any
<CODE>ServerPath</CODE> directives given in the vhosts.  Note that the
<STRONG>last match</STRONG> is used regardless (again consider the ordering of
the virtual hosts).

<H3>Observations</H3>

<UL>

<LI>It is difficult to define an IP-based vhost for the machine's
    &quot;main IP address&quot;.  You essentially have to create a bogus
    <CODE>ServerName</CODE> for the main_server that does not match the
    machine's IPs.
    <P>

<LI>During the scans in both <CODE>check_hostalias</CODE> and
    <CODE>check_serverpath</CODE> no check is made that the vhost being
    scanned is actually a name-based vhost.  This means, for example, that
    it's possible to match an IP-based vhost through another address.  But
    because the scan starts in the vhost list at the first vhost that
    matched the local IP address of the connection, not all IP-based vhosts
    can be matched.
    <P>
    Consider the config file above with three vhosts A, B, C.  Suppose
    that B is a named-based vhost, and A and C are IP-based vhosts.  If
    a request comes in on B or C's address containing a header
    &quot;<SAMP>Host: A</SAMP>&quot; then
    it will be served from A's config.  If a request comes in on A's
    address then it will always be served from A's config regardless of
    any Host: header.
    </P>

<LI>Unless you have a <SAMP>_default_</SAMP> vhost,
    it doesn't matter if you mix name-based vhosts in amongst IP-based
    vhosts.  During the <CODE>find_virtual_server</CODE> phase above no
    named-based vhost will be matched, so the main_server will remain the
    connection vhost.  Then scans will cover all vhosts in the vhost list.
    <P>
    If you do have a <SAMP>_default_</SAMP> vhost, then you cannot place
    named-based vhosts after it in the config.  This is because on any
    connection to the main server IPs the connection vhost will always be
    the <SAMP>_default_</SAMP> vhost since none of the name-based are
    considered during <CODE>find_virtual_server</CODE>.
    </P>

<LI>You should never specify DNS names in <CODE>VirtualHost</CODE>
    directives because it will force your server to rely on DNS to boot.
    Furthermore it poses a security threat if you do not control the
    DNS for all the domains listed.
    <A HREF="dns-caveats.html">There's more information
    available on this and the next two topics</A>.
    <P>

<LI><CODE>ServerName</CODE> should always be set for each vhost.  Otherwise
    A DNS lookup is required for each vhost.
    <P>

<LI>A DNS lookup is always required for the main_server's
    <CODE>ServerName</CODE> (or to generate that if it isn't specified
    in the config).
    <P>

<LI>If a <CODE>ServerPath</CODE> directive exists which is a prefix of
    another <CODE>ServerPath</CODE> directive that appears later in
    the configuration file, then the former will always be matched
    and the latter will never be matched.  (That is assuming that no
    Host header was available to disambiguate the two.)
    <P>

<LI>If a vhost that would otherwise be a name-vhost includes a
    <CODE>Port</CODE> statement that doesn't match the main_server
    <CODE>Port</CODE> then it will be considered an IP-based vhost.
    Then <CODE>find_virtual_server</CODE> will match it (because
    the ports associated with each address in the address set default
    to the port of the main_server) as the connection vhost.  Then
    <CODE>check_hostalias</CODE> will refuse to check any other name-based
    vhost because of the port mismatch.  The result is that the vhost
    will steal all hits going to the main_server address.
    <P>

<LI>If two IP-based vhosts have an address in common, the vhost appearing
    later in the file is always matched.  Such a thing might happen
    inadvertently.  If the config has name-based vhosts and for some reason
    the main_server <CODE>ServerName</CODE> resolves to the wrong address
    then all the name-based vhosts will be parsed as ip-based vhosts.
    Then the last of them will steal all the hits.
    <P>

<LI>The last name-based vhost in the config is always matched for any hit
    which doesn't match one of the other name-based vhosts.

</UL>

<H3><A NAME="whatworks">What Works</A></H3>

<P>In addition to the tips on the <A HREF="dns-caveats.html#tips">DNS
Issues</A> page, here are some further tips:

<UL>

<LI>Place all main_server definitions before any VirtualHost definitions.
(This is to aid the readability of the configuration -- the post-config
merging process makes it non-obvious that definitions mixed in around
virtualhosts might affect all virtualhosts.)
<P>

<LI>Arrange your VirtualHosts such
that all name-based virtual hosts come first, followed by IP-based
virtual hosts, followed by any <SAMP>_default_</SAMP> virtual host
<P>

<LI>Avoid <CODE>ServerPaths</CODE> which are prefixes of other
<CODE>ServerPaths</CODE>.  If you cannot avoid this then you have to
ensure that the longer (more specific) prefix vhost appears earlier in
the configuration file than the shorter (less specific) prefix
(<EM>i.e.</EM>, &quot;ServerPath /abc&quot; should appear after
&quot;ServerPath /abcdef&quot;).
<P>

<LI>Do not use <EM>port-based</EM> vhosts in the same server as
name-based vhosts.  A loose definition for port-based is a vhost which
is determined by the port on the server (<EM>i.e.</EM>, one server with
ports 8000, 8080, and 80 - all of which have different configurations).
<P>
