<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Module mod_auth_msql</H1>

This module is contained in the <code>mod_auth_msql.c</code> file and
is compiled in by default.  It allows access control using the public
domain mSQL database <code><a
href="ftp://ftp.bond.edu.au/pub/Minerva/msql">ftp://ftp.bond.edu.au/pub/Minerva/msql</a></code>,
a fast but limited SQL engine which can be contacted over an internal
Unix domain protocol as well as over normal TCP/IP socket
communication. It is only available in Apache 1.1 and later. <p>

<dl>

<code><dt>
Auth_MSQLhost &lt; FQHN | IP Address | localhost &gt
</dt></code><dd>
        Hostname of the machine running the mSQL demon. The effective uid
        of the server should be allowed access. If not given, or if it is
        the magic name <code>localhost</code>, it is passed to the mSQL library as a null
        pointer. This effectively forces it to use /dev/msql rather than the
        (slower) socket communication.
</dd>

<code><dt>
Auth_MSQLdatabase &lt; mSQL database name &gt
</dt></code><dd>
        Name of the database in which the following table(s) are contained (Quick check: use the
        mSQL command <code>relshow [&lt;hostname&gt dbase]</code> to verify the spelling of the
        database name).
</dd>

<code><dt>
Auth_MSQLpwd_table &lt; mSQL table name &gt
</dt></code><dd>
        Contains at least the fields with the username
        and the (encrypted) password. Each uid should only occur once in this table and
        for performance reasons should be a primary key.
        Normally this table is compulsory, but it is
        possible to use a fall-through to other methods
        and use the mSQL module for group control only.
        See the <a href="#Authoritative"><code>Auth_MSQL_Authoritative</code></a>
        directive below.
</dd>

<code><dt>
Auth_MSQLgrp_table &lt; mSQL table name in the above database &gt
</dt></code><dd>
        Contains at least the fields with the
        username and the groupname. A user which
        is in multiple groups has therefore
        multiple entries. There might be some performance
        problems associated with this and one
        might consider to have separate tables for each
        group (rather than all groups in one table) if
        your directory structure allows for it.
        One only need to specify this table when doing
        group control.
</dd>

<code><dt>
Auth_MSQLuid_field &lt; mSQL field name &gt
</dt></code><dd>
        Name of the field containing the username in the <code>
        Auth_MSQLpwd_table</code> and optionally in the <code>
        Auth_MSQLgrp_table</code> tables.
</dd>

<code><dt>
Auth_MSQLpwd_field &lt; mSQL field name &gt
</dt></code><dd>
        Fieldname for the passwords in the <code>
        Auth_MSQLpwd_table</code> table.
</dd>

<code><dt>
Auth_MSQLgrp_field &lt; mSQL field name &gt
</dt></code><dd>
        Fieldname for the groupname<br>
        Only the fields used need to be specified. When this
        module is compiled with the
        <a href="#VITEK"><code>BACKWARD_VITEK</code></a> option then
        the uid and pwd field names default to 'user' and 'password'.
        However you are strongly encouraged to always specify these values
        explicitly given the security issues involved.
</dd>

<code><dt>
Auth_MSQL_nopasswd &lt; on | off &gt
</dt></code><dd>
        Skip password comparison if passwd field is
        empty, i.e. allow any password. This is 'off'
        by default to ensure that an empty field
        in the mSQL table does not allow people in by
        default with a random password.
</dd>

<code><dt>
<a name="Authoritative">Auth_MSQL_Authoritative &lt; on | off &gt</a>
</dt></code><dd>
        Default is 'on'. When set 'on', there is no
        fall-through to other authorization methods. So if a
        user is not in the mSQL dbase table (and perhaps
        not in the right group) or has the password wrong, then
        he or she is denied access. When this directive is set to
        'off', control is passed on to any other authorization
        modules, such as the basic auth module with the htpasswd
        file or the Unix-(g)dbm modules. The default is 'on'
        to avoid nasty 'fall-through' surprises. Be sure you
        know what you are doing when you decide to switch it off.
</dd>

<code><dt>
Auth_MSQL_EncryptedPasswords &lt; on | off &gt
</dt></code><dd>
        Default is 'on'. When set on, the values in the
        pwd_field are assumed to be crypt-ed using *your*
        machines 'crypt()' function and the incoming password
        is 'crypt'ed before comparison. When this function is
        'off', the comparison is done directly with the plaintext
        entered password. (Yes, http-basic-auth does send the
        password as plaintext over the wire :-( ). The default
        is a sensible 'on', and I personally think that it is
        a *very-bad-idea* to change this. However a multi
        vendor or international environment (which sometimes
        leads to different crypts functions) might force you to.

<hr><h2><a name="Example">Example</a></h2>

An example mSQL table could be created with the following commands:
<pre>
     % msqladmin create www               <br>
     % msql www                           <br>
     -&gt; create table user_records (       <br>
     -&gt;   User_id  char(32) primary key,  <br>
     -&gt;   Cpasswd  char(32),              <br>
     -&gt;   Xgroup   char(32)               <br>
     -&gt;   ) \g                            <br>
     query OK                             <br>
     -&gt; \q                                <br>
     %                                    <br>
</pre><br>

The <code>User_id</code> can be as long as desired. However some of the
popular web browsers truncate names at or stop the user from entering
names longer than 32 characters. Furthermore the 'crypt' function
on your platform might impose further limits. Also use of
the <code>require users uid [uid..]</code> directive in the
<code>access.conf</code> file where the uid's are separated by
spaces can possibly prohibit the use of spaces in your usernames.
Also, please note the <a href="#MAX_FIELD_LEN"><code>MAX_FIELD_LEN</code></a>
directive somewhere below.
<p>
To use the above, the following example could be in your
<code>access.conf</code> file. Also there is a more elaborate description
below this example.
<p>

<code>&lt;directory /web/docs/private&gt;</code>
<p>

<dl>

    <blockquote>or</blockquote>
<dt><code>

</code></dt><dd>
                If this directive is omitted or set to <code>localhost</code>,
                it is assumed that Apache and the mSQL
                database run on the same (physical) machine and the faster
                /dev/msql communication channel will be used. Otherwise,
                it is the machine to contact by TCP/IP. Consult the mSQL
                documentation for more information.
</dd>
<p>

<dt><code>
Auth_MSQLdatabase    www
</code></dt><dd>
                The name of the database on the above machine,
                which contains *both* the tables for group and
                for user/passwords. Currently it is not possible
                to have these split over two databases. Make
                sure that the <code>msql.acl</code> (access control file) of
                mSQL does indeed allow the effective uid of the
                web server read access to this database. Check the
                httpd.conf file for this uid.
</dd>

<code><dt>
Auth_MSQLpwd_table   user_records
</dt></code><dd>
                This is the table which contain the uid/password combination
                is specified.
</dd>

<code><dt>
Auth_MSQLuid_field   User_id <br>
Auth_MSQLpwd_field   Cpasswd
</dt></code><dd>
                These two directive specify the field names in the <code>user_record</code>
                table. If this module is compiled with the <a href="#VITEK"><code>BACKWARD_VITEK</code></a>
                compatibility switch, the defaults <code>user</code> and <code>password</code> are
                assumed if you do not specify them. Currently the user_id field
                *MUST* be a primary key or one must ensure that each user only
                occurs <b>once</b> in the table. If a uid occurs twice access is
                denied by default; but see the <code><a href="#ONLY_ONCE">ONLY_ONCE</a></code>
                compiler directive for more information.
</dd>

<code><dt>
Auth_MSQLgrp_table   user_records <br>
Auth_MSQLgrp_field   Xgroup       <br>
</dt></code><dd>
                Optionally one can also specify a table which contains the
                user/group combinations. This can be the same table which
                also contains the username/password combinations. However
                if a user belongs to two or more groups, one will have to
                use a different table with multiple entries.
</dd>

<code><dt>

                These three optional fields (all set to the sensible defaults,
                so you really do not have to enter them) are described in more
                detail below. If you choose to set these to any other values then
                the above, be very sure you understand the security implications and
                do verify that Apache does what you expect it to do.

<a name="ONLY_ONCE">#define ONLY_ONCE 1</a>
</code></dt><dd>
   If the mSQL table containing the uid/passwd combination does
   not have the uid field as a primary key, it is possible for the
   uid to occur more than once in the table with possibly different
   passwords. When this module is compiled with the <code>ONLY_ONCE</code>
   directive set, access is denied if the uid occurs more than once in the
   uid/passwd table. If you choose not to set it, the software takes
   the first pair returned and ignores any further pairs. The SQL
   statement used for this is<br>
   <p><code>"select password form pwd_table where user='UID'"</code><p>
   this might lead to unpredictable results. For this reason as well
   as for performance reasons you are strongly advised to make the
   uid field a primary key. Use at your own peril :-)
</dd>

<dt><code>
<a name="KEEP_MSQL_CONNECTION_OPEN">#define KEEP_MSQL_CONNECTION_OPEN</a>
</code></dt><dd>
   Normally the (TCP/IP) connection with the database is opened and
   closed for each SQL query. When the Apache web-server and the database
   are on the same machine, and /dev/msql is used this does not
   cause a serious overhead. However when your platform does not
   support this (see the mSQL documentation) or when the web server
   and the database are on different machines the overhead can be
   considerable. When the above directive is set defined the server leaves
   the connection open, i.e. no call to <code>msqlClose()</code>.
   If an error occurs an attempt is made to reopen the connection for
   the next http request.
   <p>
   This has a number of very serious drawbacks
   <ul><li> It costs 2 already rare file-descriptors for each child.
       <li> It costs msql-connections, typically one per child. The (compiled in)
            number of connections mSQL can handle is low, typically 6 or 12.
            which might prohibit access to the mSQL database for later
            processes.
       <li> When a child dies, it might not free that connection properly
            or quick enough.
       <li> When errors start to occur, connection/file-descriptor resources
            might become exhausted very quickly.
   </ul>
   <p>
   In short, use this at your own peril and only in a highly controlled and
   monitored environment.

   A second mSQL auth module for Apache has also been developed by Vivek Khera
   &lt<a href="mailto:khera@kciLink.com"><code>khera@kciLink.com</code></a>&gt
   and was subsequently distributed with some early versions of Apache. It
   can be obtained from
   <code><a href="ftp://ftp.kcilink.com/pub/">ftp://ftp.kcilink.com/pub/mod_auth_msql.c*</a></code>.
   Older 'vitek' versions had the field/table names compiled in. Newer
   versions, v.1.11 have more <code>access.conf</code> configuration
   options. However these where chosen not to be in line the 'ewse'
   version of this module. Also, the 'vitek' module does not give group
   control or 'empty' password control.
   <p>
   To get things slightly more in line this version (0.9) should
   be backward compatible with the 'vitek' module by:
   <ul><li> Adding support for the <code>Auth_MSQL_EncryptedPasswords</code> on/off functionality
       <li> Adding support for the different spelling of the 4 configuration
            tokens for user-table-name, user/password-field-name and dbase-name.
       <li> Setting some field names to a default which used to be hard
            coded in in older 'vitek' modules.
   </ul>

   If this troubles you, remove the 'BACKWARD_VITEK' define.

</code></dt><dd>
   In order to avoid using the very large <code>HUGE_STRING_LENGTH</code>, the above two compile
   time directives are supplies. The <code>MAX_FIELD_LEN</code> contains the maximum number of
   characters in your user, password and group fields. The maximum query length is derived
   from those values.
   <p>
   We only do the following two queries:
   <ul><li>For the user/passwd combination
           <p><code>"select PWDFIELD from PWDTABLE where USERFIELD='UID'"</code><br>
       <li>Optionally for the user/group combination:
           <p><code>"select GROUPFIELD from GROUPTABLE where USERFIELD='UID' and GROUPFIELD='GID'"</code><br>
   </ul>
   <p>
   This leads to the above limit for the query string. We are ignoring escaping a wee bit here
   assuming not more than 24 escapes.)
