<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Module mod_auth_dbm</h1>

This module is contained in the <code>mod_auth_dbm.c</code> file, and
is not compiled in by default. It provides for user authentication using
DBM files.

<strong>Syntax:</strong> AuthDBMGroupFile <em>filename</em><br>
<Strong>Context:</strong> directory, .htaccess<br>
<Strong>Override:</strong> AuthConfig<br>
<strong>Status:</strong> Extension<br>
<strong>Module:</strong> mod_auth_dbm<p>

The AuthDBMGroupFile directive sets the name of a DBM file containing the list
of user groups for user authentication. <em>Filename</em> is the absolute path
to the group file.<p>

The group file is keyed on the username. The value for a user is a
comma-separated list of the groups to which the users belongs. There must
be no whitespace within the value, and it must never contain any colons.<p>

Security: make sure that the AuthDBMGroupFile is stored outside the
document tree of the web-server; do <em>not</em> put it in the directory that
it protects. Otherwise, clients will be able to download the
AuthDBMGroupFile unless otherwise protected.<p>

Combining Group and Password DBM files: In some cases it is easier to
manage a single database which contains both the password and group
details for each user. This simplifies any support programs that need
to be written: they now only have to deal with writing to and locking
a single DBM file. This can be accomplished by first setting the group
and password files to point to the same DBM:<p>

<blockquote><code>
AuthDBMGroupFile /www/userbase<br>
AuthDBMUserFile /www/userbase
</code></blockquote>

The key for the single DBM is the username. The value consists of <p>

<blockquote><code>
Unix Crypt-ed Password : List of Groups [ : (ignored) ]
</code></blockquote>

The password section contains the Unix crypt() password as before. This is
followed by a colon and the comma separated list of groups. Other data may
optionally be left in the DBM file after another colon; it is ignored by the
authentication module. This is what www.telescope.org uses for its combined
password and group database. <p>

<Strong>Context:</strong> directory, .htaccess<br>

<strong>Status:</strong> Extension<br>
<strong>Module:</strong> mod_auth_dbm<p>

The AuthDBMUserFile directive sets the name of a DBM file containing the list
of users and passwords for user authentication. <em>Filename</em> is the
absolute path to the user file.<p>

The user file is keyed on the username. The value for a user is the
crypt() encrypted password, optionally followed by a colon and
arbitrary data.  The colon and the data following it will be ignored
by the server.<p>

Security: make sure that the AuthDBMUserFile is stored outside the
document tree of the web-server; do <em>not</em> put it in the directory that
it protects. Otherwise, clients will be able to download the
AuthDBMUserFile.<p>

Important compatibility note: The implementation of "dbmopen" in the
apache modules reads the string length of the hashed values from the
DBM data structures, rather than relying upon the string being
NULL-appended. Some applications, such as the Netscape web server,
rely upon the string being NULL-appended, so if you are having trouble
using DBM files interchangeably between applications this may be a
part of the problem. <p>

<A name="authdbmauthoritative"><h2>AuthDBMAuthoritative</h2></A>
<!--%plaintext &lt;?INDEX {\tt AuthDBMAuthoritative} directive&gt; -->
<strong>Syntax:</strong> AuthDBMAuthoritative &lt; <strong> on</strong>(default) | off &gt; <br>
<Strong>Context:</strong> directory, .htaccess<br>
<Strong>Override:</strong> AuthConfig<br>
<strong>Status:</strong> Base<br>
<strong>Module:</strong> mod_auth<p>

Setting the AuthDBMAuthoritative directive explicitly to <b>'off'</b>
allows for both authentication and authorization to be passed on
to lower level modules (as defined in the <code>Configuration</code>
and <code>modules.c</code> file if there is <b>no userID</b> or
<b>rule</b> matching the supplied userID. If there is a userID
and/or rule specified; the usual password and access checks will
be applied and a failure will give an Authorization Required reply.
<p>
So if a userID appears in the database of more than one module; or
if a valid require directive applies to more than one module; then
the first module will verify the credentials; and no access is
passed on; regardless of the AuthAuthoritative setting.  <p>

A common use for this is in conjunction with one of the basic auth
modules; such as <a href="mod_auth.html"><code>mod_auth.c</code></a>.
Whereas this DBM module supplies the bulk of the user credential
checking; a few (administrator) related accesses fall through to
a lower level with a well protected .htpasswd file.  <p>

<b>Default:</b> By default; control is not passed on; and an unknown
userID or rule will result in an Authorization Required reply. Not
setting it thus keeps the system secure; and forces an NSCA compliant
behaviour.  <p>

Security: Do consider the implications of allowing a user to allow
fall-through in his .htaccess file; and verify that this is really
what you want; Generally it is easier to just secure a single
.htpasswd file, than it is to secure a database which might have
more access interfaces.
