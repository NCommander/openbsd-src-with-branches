<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Module mod_log_common</h1>

This module is contained in the <code>mod_log_common.c</code> file,
and is compiled in by default. It provides for logging of the requests
made to the server using the Common Logfile Format. This module has
been replaced by mod_log_config in Apache 1.2

<h2>Log file format</h2>
The log file contains a separate line for each request. A line is composed
of several tokens separated by spaces:
<blockquote>
host ident authuser date request status bytes
</blockquote>
If a token does not have a value then it is represented by a hyphen (-).
The meanings and values of these tokens are as follows:
<dl>
<dt>host
<dd>The fully-qualified domain name of the client, or its IP number if the
name is not available.
<dt>ident
<dd>If <A HREF="core.html#identitycheck">IdentityCheck</A> is enabled and the
client machine runs identd, then this is the identity information reported
by the client.
<dt>authuser
<dd>If the request was for an password protected document, then this is
the userid used in the request.
<dt>date
<dd>The date and time of the request, in the following format:
<dl><dd><blockquote><code> date = [day/month/year:hour:minute:second zone] <br>
day = 2*digit<br>
month = 3*letter<br>
year = 4*digit<br>
hour = 2*digit<br>
minute = 2*digit<br>
second = 2*digit<br>
zone = (`+' | `-') 4*digit</code></blockquote></dl>
<dt>request
<dd>The request line from the client, enclosed in double quotes
(<code>&quot;</code>).
<dt>status
<dd>The three digit status code returned to the client.
<dt>bytes
<dd>The number of bytes in the object returned to the client, not including
any headers.
</dl>


<h2>Directives</h2>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="#transferlog">TransferLog</A>
</ul>
<hr>


<h2><A name="transferlog">TransferLog</A></h2>
<!--%plaintext &lt;?INDEX {\tt TransferLog} directive&gt; -->
<strong>Syntax:</strong> TransferLog <em>file-pipe</em><br>
<strong>Default:</strong> <code>TransferLog logs/transfer_log</code><br>
<Strong>Context:</strong> server config, virtual host<br>
<strong>Status:</strong> Base<br>
<strong>Module:</strong> mod_log_common<p>

The TransferLog directive sets the name of the file to which the server will
log the incoming requests. <em>File-pipe</em> is one
of
<dl><dt>A filename
<dd>A filename relative to the <A HREF="core.html#serverroot">ServerRoot</A>.
<dt> `|' followed by a command
<dd>A program to receive the agent log information on its standard input.
Note the a new program will not be started for a VirtualHost if it inherits
the TransferLog from the main server.
</dl>
<strong>Security:</strong> if a program is used, then it will be
run under the user who started httpd. This will be root if the server
was started by root; be sure that the program is secure.<p>

<strong>Security:</strong> See the <A
HREF="../misc/security_tips.html">security tips</A> document for
details on why your security could be compromised if the directory
where logfiles are stored is writable by anyone other than the user
that starts the server.<P>
