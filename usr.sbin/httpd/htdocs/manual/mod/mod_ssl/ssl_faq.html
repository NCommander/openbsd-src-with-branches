    <strong id="faq">What are the differences between mod_ssl and Apache-SSL, from where it is derived?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/docs/2.2/ssl_faq.html#apssl-diff"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    This cannot be answered in short, because there are too much changes (see
    the <code>CHANGES</code> and <code>CHANGES.20</code> files in the mod_ssl
    distribution for detailed information). Most of them are internal changes,
    cleanups and re-organizations of the source code. But the user visible
    changes are mainly the following:
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li><em>mod_ssl provides a complete documentation</em> (this User Manual)
        where all configuration directives, environment variables, and other
        things are documented while Apache-SSL had no such documentation
        although it existed for over three years when mod_ssl was split from
        it (in April 1998). Additionally mod_ssl provides answers to often
        occuring frequently asked questions (this list) in the
        Apache/SSL/SSLeay area. For instance mod_ssl gives detailed hints
        about how to setup a CA, how to create real a server Certificate, etc.
        And the mod_ssl User Manual provides a compact introduction to the
        complex SSL area itself. Because here are the typical hurdles located
        every user stumbles over.
    <p>
    <li><em>mod_ssl comes with clean and documented source code</em> with the
        intent that only this way the user is able to re-view it for
        backdoors, security holes, etc. This is considered important for
        security-related software. It was always incomprehensible to the
        author of mod_ssl how Apache-SSL could exist for over three years
        while both the source code and the source patches were provided in an
        undocumented and partly unreadable format. For the mod_ssl package
        the source codes follows the Apache coding style, is logically
        ordered to follow the API phases and even the patches to the
        Apache source tree are annotated with descriptions to give the
        user a chance to re-view and understand them.
    <p>
    <li><em>mod_ssl uses a generic Extended API</em> to achieve
        its functionality. This means instead of patching in
        SSL/crypto-related code into the Apache kernel a clean and well
        separated Extended API is patched in. This way the SSL and
        cryptography code is <em>only</em> present inside the SSL module
        itself (i.e. inside the <code>src/modules/ssl/</code> subtree only).
        The benefit from this is a clean separation and API-conforming SSL
        solution (which means for instance no direct SSL-references from the
        kernel, no kludges and hacks to get called, etc).
    <p>
    <li><em>mod_ssl supports Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) building</em>
        as a direct consequence from using the Extended API. In short DSO
        support means maximum flexibility under run-time, i.e. you don't have
        to decide under compile-time whether to build or not to build SSL into
        the Apache httpd executable. Instead you can just load mod_ssl through
        mod_so's <code>LoadModule</code> directive <em>on demand</em>. This
        is especially interesting for two cases: Vendor package maintainers
        receive the power they need for creating flexible packages and power
        users receive the ability to run more than one Apache (non-SSL-aware
        and SSL-aware) instance from a single Apache installation while still
        saving RAM.
    <p>
    <li><em>mod_ssl is ported to the Win32 platform</em>,
        as it's the case for Apache and SSLeay. This way mod_ssl follows the
        evolution of these packages and provides the always requested support
        also for this nasty platform. As for the Unix/DSO case under Win32
        mod_ssl is well-integrated into Apache through a stand-alone DLL which
        can be loaded through mod_so's <code>LoadModule</code> directive.
    <p>
    <li><em>mod_ssl can be really easily applied to the Apache source tree</em> because
        it provides a full-featured and automated configuration environment
        for this task while Apache-SSL forced the user to fiddle with the
        <code>patch</code> and <code>cp</code> tools theirself. Just
        because security is not for amateurs hasn't to mean that user
        friendliness is not important. So it's a must to assist the user
        in applying the SSL-stuff to vanilla Apache sources. For this
        mod_ssl integrates also very-well into the new Apache 1.3
        Autoconf-style Interface (APACI). Additionally mod_ssl's
        configuration mechanism supports the usage of RSAref, arbitrary
        locations for SSLeay, etc.
    <p>
    <li><em>mod_ssl fixes a lot of bugs and inconsistencies</em> which
        existed in Apache-SSL. For Apache experts here are a few impressions:
        Apache-SSL wrote directly to <code>stderr</code> instead of the Apache
        error logfile; it messed up it's error messages with the SSLeay error
        messages; it directly patched the <code>SERVER_BASEVERSION</code>
        define instead of using the Apache 1.3 conforming
        <code>ap_add_version_component</code> function; it used the unsafe
        <code>sprintf</code> function instead of the robust
        <code>ap_snprintf</code>; it incorrectly spawned and killed the
        <code>gcache</code> auxiliary program and it totally failed to pass the
        ``<code>gcc -Wall -Wshadow -Wpointer-arith -Wcast-align
        -Wmissing-prototypes -Wmissing-declarations -Wnested-externs
        -Winline</code>'' test (while Apache already passes it) because of
        unclean code.
        <p>
        Additionally Apache-SSL didn't provide a way to easily apply it to
        the Apache source tree (semi-manual editing and patching was
        required); it didn't seamlessly integrate into the new Apache 1.3
        Autoconf-style Interface (APACI) at configuration time; it didn't
        automatically recognize the difference between an installed SSLeay and
        an out-of-the-source-only SSLeay; it didn't provide integration into
        the APACI installation process (<code>make install</code>); it used
        numbers 0 to 2 instead of reasonable names for the argument of
        <code>SSLVerifyClient</code> just because internally an
        <code>enum</code> was used and for the provided
        <code>%{version}c</code> construct of CustomLog it used the results
        "2", "3" under SSLeay 0.8 while under SSLeay 0.9 the results were
        "SSL2", "SSL3", etc. pp.
    <p>
    <li><em>mod_ssl adds new functionalities which were missing in
        Apache-SSL</em>. A few selected points which give you an impression
        follow:
        <ul>
        <li>mod_ssl provides a real dedicated SSL log file controlled by log
            level and the additional features that messages logged at the
            `error' level are automatically duplicated to the general Apache
            error log file. And occuring system and SSLeay error messages are
            automatically appended to mod_ssl messages. Additionally mod_ssl
            annotates deep-level SSLeay messages with more high-level hints.
        <li>mod_ssl provides a completely new and enhanced handling
            of encrypted private key files. First the private keys are kept in
            a permanent memory pool (as SSLeay already does internally), so
            Apache now survives server restarts without falling down. Second
            the pass phrase dialog is a lot more user friendly and advanced:
            It uses a pass phrase reuse-algorithm to minimize the dialog, it
            recognizes wrong pass phrases and allows retries (but with a
            backoff time delay), etc. And additionally a minimal interface is
            provided to plug-in an external program for providing the pass
            phrase for special batch security situations.
        <li>mod_ssl provides the <code>SSLCACertificateReqFile</code>
            directive which can be used to configure a different (from
            <code>SSLCACertificateFile</code>) set of CA Certificates for the
            SSLv3 feature used by the clients to load CA Certificates from the
            server for speeding up server authentication.
        <li>mod_ssl replaced the ``gcache'' stuff of Apache-SSL (used for
            caching SSL sessions) with a more robust DBM-based solution,
            because the controlling of an external program cannot be done very
            reliable from within Apache. Additionally a "mutex" is now used to
            synchronize the inter-process access to this cache.
        <li>mod_ssl provides support for the SSLeay+RSAref couple, i.e.
            mod_ssl supports the building with RSAref.
        <li>mod_ssl provides a new SSLRequire directive which can be used
            to implement more granular access control based on arbitrary
            complex boolean expression.
        <li>mod_ssl adds support for HTTPS to the Apache Proxy Module
            (mod_proxy).

    <strong>No</strong>, it just means that you <em>can</em> use mod_ssl.
    Beside the well-known flaws Apache-SSL works great. Ben Laurie did and
    still does a great job in maintaining it. The big difference is just that
    Ben Laurie's goals are different from Ralf S. Engelschall's goals. So, as
    long as you don't get bothered by inconsistencies and other flaws you
    don't have to upgrade. Instead you should decide yourself if you already
    feel comfortable or not. If yes, stay with Apache-SSL - if not, move to
    mod_ssl or (even better) one of the commercial SSL solutions for Apache.
    Or in other words: No solution is better than another in general. Which
    one you should use depends mainly on your personal requirements.

    [<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/docs/2.2/ssl_faq.html#apssl-baseversion"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    The mod_ssl package was initially created by porting the Apache-SSL 1.17
    stuff from Apache 1.2.6 to Apache 1.3b6 in April 1998. Because of
    conflicts with Ben Laurie's development cycle it then was re-assembled
    from scratch for Apache 1.3.0 by merging the old mod_ssl with the newer
    Apache-SSL 1.18. From this point mod_ssl lived its own life and changes
    with Apache-SSL releases were merged after they were released. In other
    words: mod_ssl is based on the latest Apache-SSL and always will contain
    all useful changes which will occur with Apache-SSL in the future.

    [<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/docs/2.2/ssl_faq.html#why200"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    Because initially the mod_ssl project was intended as a contribution to
    the Apache-SSL project from Ben Laurie. The idea was that mod_ssl formed
    Apache-SSL 2.0.0. But after Ralf S. Engelschall and Ben Laurie couldn't
    find a reasonable compromise in merging mod_ssl with Apache-SSL, the stuff
    was released as a new package named ``mod_ssl''. But to still indicate
    that it's some ``second generation'' stuff, the first mod_ssl version was
    named 2.0.0.

    [<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/docs/2.2/ssl_faq.html#what-version"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    That's trivial: mod_ssl uses version strings of the syntax
    <em>&lt;mod_ssl-version&gt;</em>-<em>&lt;apache-version&gt;</em>, for
    instance <code>2.2.0-1.3.4</code>. This directly indicates that it's
    mod_ssl version 2.2.0 for Apache version 1.3.4. And this also means you
    <em>only</em> can apply this mod_ssl version to exactly this Apache
    version (unless you use the <code>--force</code> option to mod_ssl's
    <code>configure</code> command ;-).

    [<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/docs/2.2/ssl_faq.html#y2k"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    Yes, mod_ssl is Year 2000 compliant.
    <p>
    Because first mod_ssl internally never stores years as two digits.
    Instead it always uses the ANSI C &amp; POSIX numerical data type
    <code>time_t</code> type, which on mostly all Unix platforms at the moment
    is a <code>signed long</code> (usually 32-bits) representing seconds since
    epoch of January 1st, 1970, 00:00 UTC. This signed value overflows in
    early January 2038 and not in the year 2000. Second, date and time
    presentations (for instance the variable ``<code>%{TIME_YEAR}</code>'')
    are done with full year value instead of abbreviating to two digits.
    <p>
    Additionally according to a <a
    href="http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#year2000">Year 2000
    statement</a> from the Apache Group, the Apache webserver is Year 2000
    compliant, too. But whether SSLeay or the underlaying Operating System
    (either a Unix or Win32 platform) is Year 2000 compliant is a different
    question which cannot be answered here.

    [<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/docs/2.2/ssl_faq.html#wassenaar"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
	First, let us explain what <i>Wassenaar</i> and it's <i>Arrangement on
	Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and
	Technologies</i> is: This is a international regime, established 1995, to
	control trade in conventional arms and dual-use goods and technology. It
	replaced the previous <i>CoCom</i> regime. 33 countries are signatories:
	Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic,
	Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan,
	Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic
	of Korea, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden,
	Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom and United States. For more
	details look at <a
	href="http://www.wassenaar.org/">http://www.wassenaar.org/</a>.
    <p>
    In short: The aim of the Wassenaar Arrangement is to prevent the build up
    of military capabilities that threaten regional and international security
    and stability. The Wassenaar Arrangement controls the export of
    cryptography as a dual-use good, i.e., one that has both military and
    civilian applications. However, the Wassenaar Arrangement also provides an
    exemption from export controls for mass-market software and free software.
    <p>
	In the current Wassenaar ``<i>List of Dual Use Goods and Technologies And
	Munitions</i>'', under ``<i>GENERAL SOFTWARE NOTE</i>'' (GSN) it says
	``<i>The Lists do not control "software" which is either: 1. [...] 2. "in
	the public domain".</i>'' And under ``<i>DEFINITIONS OF TERMS USED IN
	THESE LISTS</i>'' one can find the definition: ``<i>"In the public
	domain": This means "technology" or "software" which has been made
	available without restrictions upon its further dissemination. N.B.
	Copyright restrictions do not remove "technology" or "software" from being
	"in the public domain".</i>''
    <p>
    So, both mod_ssl and SSLeay are ``in the public domain'' for the purposes
    of the Wassenaar Agreement and its ``<i>List of Dual Use Goods and
    Technologies And Munitions List</i>''.
    <p>
    Additionally the Wassenaar Agreement itself has no direct consequence for
    exporting cryptography software. What is actually allowed or forbidden to
    be exported from the countries has still to be defined in the local laws
    of each country. And at least according to official press releases from
    the German BMWi (see <a
    href="http://www.bmwi.de/presse/1998/1208prm2.html">here</a>) and the
    Switzerland Bawi (see <a href="http://jya.com/wass-ch.htm">here</a>) there
    will be no forthcoming export restriction for free cryptography software
    for their countries. Remember that mod_ssl is created in Germany and
    distributed from Switzerland.
    <p>
    So, mod_ssl and SSLeay are not affected by the Wassenaar Agreement.

    <strong id="faq">I want to run HTTP and HTTPS on the same machine. Is that possible?</strong></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/docs/2.2/ssl_faq.html#https-parallel"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    Yes, there are two ways to do this: run two server instances, or run both
    services from the same server instance. Unless there is a good reason to
    run two (like using a different product for HTTP and HTTPS), it's usually
    most simples to run a single instance where you enable SSL only for those
    virtual hosts that need it. If you wish to run two server instances you
    must make sure that they each only try to bind to their allowed ports
    (normally port 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS).
<p>
<li><a name="ToC11"></a>
    <a name="https-port"></a>
    <strong id="faq">I know that HTTP is on port 80, but where is HTTPS?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/docs/2.2/ssl_faq.html#https-port"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    You can run HTTPS on any port, but the standards specify port 443, which
    is where any HTTPS compliant browser will look by default. You can force
    your browser to look on a different port by specifying it in the URL like
    this (for port 666): <code>https://secure.server.dom:666/</code>
<p>
<li><a name="ToC12"></a>
    <a name="https-test"></a>
    <strong id="faq">How can I speak HTTPS manually for testing purposes?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/docs/2.2/ssl_faq.html#https-test"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    While you usually just use
    <p>
    <code><b>$ telnet localhost 80</b></code><br>
    <code><b>GET / HTTP/1.0</b></code>
    <p>
    for simple testing the HTTP protocol of Apache, it's not such easy for
    HTTPS because of the SSL protocol between TCP and HTTP. But with the
    help of SSLeay's <code>s_client</code> program you can do a similar
    check even for HTTPS:
    <p>
    <code><b>$ s_client -connect localhost:443 -state -debug</b></code><br>
    <code><b>GET / HTTP/1.0</b></code>
    <p>
    Before the actual HTTP response you receive detailed information about the
    SSL handshake. For a more general command line client which directly
    understands both the HTTP and HTTPS scheme, can perform GET and POST
    methods, can use a proxy, supports byte ranges, etc. you should have a
    look at nifty <a href="http://www.fts.frontec.se/~dast/curl/">cURL</a>
    tool. With it you can directly check if your Apache is running fine on
    Port 80 and 443 as following:
    <p>
    <code><b>$ curl http://localhost/</b></code><br>
    <code><b>$ curl https://localhost/</b></code><br>

    [<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/docs/2.2/ssl_faq.html#hang"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    Because you used an URL of the form ``<code>http://</code>'' instead of
    ``<code>https:</code>''. Really! Also, if you see: ``<code>SSL_Accept
    failed error:140760EB:SSL routines: SSL23_GET_CLIENT_HELLO:unknown
    protocol</code>'' in your Apache error logfile, it's for the same reason.
    This also happens the other way round, i.e. when you try to use
    ``<code>https://</code>'' on a server that doesn't support SSL (on this
    port). Make sure you are connecting to a virtual server that supports
    SSL, which is probably the IP associated with your hostname, not localhost
    (127.0.0.1).

    [<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/docs/2.2/ssl_faq.html#relative-links"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    Usually you have to use fully-qualified hyperlinks because
    you have to change the URL scheme. But with the help of some URL
    manipulations through mod_rewrite you can achieve the same effect while
    you still can use relative URLs:
    <pre>
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteRule   ^/(.*):SSL$   https://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1 [R,L]
    RewriteRule   ^/(.*):NOSSL$ http://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1  [R,L]
    </pre>
    This rewrite ruleset lets you use hyperlinks of the form
    <pre>
    &lt;a href="document.html:SSL"&gt
    </pre>

    <p>
    The RSA private key file is a digital file that you can use to decrypt
    messages sent to you. It has a public component which you distribute (via
    your Certificate file) which allows people to encrypt those messages to
    you. A Certificate Signing Request (CSR) is a digital file which contains
    your public key and your name. You send the CSR to a Certifying Authority
    (CA) to be converted into a real Certificate. A Certificate contains your
    RSA public key, your name, the name of the CA, and is digitally signed by
    your CA. Browsers that know the CA can verify the signature on that
    Certificate, thereby obtaining your RSA public key. That enables them to
    send messages which only you can decrypt.

    [<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/docs/2.2/ssl_faq.html#startup"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    Yes, in general, starting Apache with a built-in mod_ssl is just like
    starting an unencumbered Apache, except for the fact that when you have a
    pass phrase on your SSL private key file. Then a startup dialog pops up
    asking you to enter the pass phrase.
    <p>
    To type in the pass phrase manually when starting the server can be
    problematic, for instance when starting the server from the system boot
    scripts. As an alternative to this situation you can follow the steps
    below under ``How can I get rid of the pass-phrase dialog at Apache

    <p>
    A Certificate does not have to be signed by a public CA. You can use your
    private key to sign the Certificate which contains your public key. You
    can install this Certificate into your server, and people using Netscape
    Navigator (not MSIE) will be able to connect after clicking OK to a
    warning dialogue. You can get MSIE to work, and your customers can
    eliminate the dialogue, by installing that Certificate manually into their
    browsers.
    <p>
    Just use the ``<code>make certificate</code>'' command at the top-level
    directory of the Apache source tree right before installing Apache via
    ``<code>make install</code>''. This creates a self-signed SSL Certificate
    which expires after 30 days and isn't encrypted (which means you don't
    need to enter a pass-phrase at Apache startup time).

    <p>
    Here is a step-by-step description:
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li>Make sure SSLeay is really installed and in your <code>PATH</code>.
        But some commands even work ok when you just run the
        ``<code>ssleay</code>'' program from within the SSLeay source tree as
        ``<code>./apps/ssleay</code>''.
    <p>
    <li>Create a RSA private key for your Apache server
       (will be Triple-DES encrypted and PEM formatted):
       <p>
       <code><strong>$ ssleay genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024</strong></code>
       <p>
       Please backup this <code>server.key</code> file and remember the
       pass-phrase you had to enter at a secure location.
       You can see the details of this RSA private key via the command:
       <p>
       <code><strong>$ ssleay rsa -noout -text -in server.key</strong></code>
       <p>
       And you could create a decrypted PEM version (not recommended)
       of this RSA private key via:
       <p>
       <code><strong>$ ssleay rsa -in server.key -out server.key.unsecure</strong></code>
    <p>
    <li>Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for the server RSA private
       key (output will be PEM formatted):
       <p>
       <code><strong>$ ssleay req -new -days 365 -key server.key -out server.csr</strong></code>
       <p>
       You can see the details of this CSR via the command
       <p>
       <code><strong>$ ssleay req -noout -text -in server.csr</strong></code>
    <p>
    <li>You now have to send this Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to
       a Certifying Authority (CA) for signing. The result is then a real
       Certificate which can be used for Apache. Here you have to options:
       First you can let the CSR sign by a commercial CA like Verisign or
       Thawte. Then you usually have to post the CSR into a web form, pay for
       the signing and await the signed Certificate you then can store into a
       server.crt file. For more information about commercial CAs have a look
       at the following locations:

       <p>
       Second you can use your own CA and now have to sign the CSR yourself by
       this CA. Read the next answer in this FAQ on how to sign a CSR with
       your CA yourself.
       You can see the details of the received Certificate via the command:
       <p>
       <code><strong>$ ssleay x509 -noout -text -in server.crt</strong></code>
    <p>
    <li>Now you have two files: <code>server.key</code> and
    <code>server.crt</code>. These now can be used as following inside your
    Apache's <code>httpd.conf</code> file:
       <pre>
       SSLCertificateFile    /path/to/this/server.crt
       SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/this/server.key
       </pre>
       The <code>server.csr</code> file is no longer needed.

    <p>
    The short answer is to use the <code>CA.sh</code> script provided by SSLeay.
    The long and manual answer is this:
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li> Create a RSA private key for your CA

       <code><strong>$ ssleay genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 1024</strong></code>
       <p>
       Please backup this <code>ca.key</code> file and remember the
       pass-phrase you currently entered at a secure location.
       You can see the details of this RSA private key via the command
       <p>
       <code><strong>$ ssleay rsa -noout -text -in ca.key</strong></code>

       <code><strong>$ ssleay rsa -in ca.key -out ca.key.unsecure</strong></code>
    <p>
    <li>Create a self-signed CA Certificate (X509 structure)
       for the RSA key of the CA (output will be PEM formatted):
       <p>
       <code><strong>$ ssleay req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca.key -out ca.crt</strong></code>
       <p>
       You can see the details of this Certificate via the command:
       <p>
       <code><strong>$ ssleay x509 -noout -text -in ca.crt</strong></code>
    <p>
    <li>Prepare a script for signing which is needed because
       the ``<code>ssleay ca</code>'' command has some strange requirements
       and the default SSLeay config doesn't allow one easily to use
       ``<code>ssleay ca</code>'' directly. So a script named
       <code>sign.sh</code> is distributed with the mod_ssl distribution
       (subdir <code>pkg.contrib/</code>). Use this script for signing.
    <p>
    <li>Now you can use this CA to sign CSR's in order to create real
       SSL Certificates for use inside an Apache webserver:
       <p>
       <code><strong>$ ./sign.sh server.csr</strong></code>
       <p>
       This signs the CSR and results in a <code>server.crt</code> file.

    <strong id="faq">How can I change the pass-phrase on my private key file?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/docs/2.2/ssl_faq.html#change-passphrase"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    You simply have to read it with the old pass-phrase and write it again
    by specifying the new pass-phrase. You can accomplish this with the following
    commands:
    <p>
    <code><strong>$ ssleay rsa -des3 -in server.key -out server.key.new</strong></code><br>
    <code><strong>$ mv server.key.new server.key</strong></code><br>
    <p>
    Here you're asked two times for a PEM pass-phrase. At the first
    prompt enter the old pass-phrase and at the second prompt
    enter the new pass-phrase.
<p>
<li><a name="ToC22"></a>
    <a name="remove-passphrase"></a>
    <strong id="faq">How can I get rid of the pass-phrase dialog at Apache startup time?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/docs/2.2/ssl_faq.html#remove-passphrase"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    The reason why this dialog pops up at startup and every re-start
    is that the RSA private key inside your server.key file is stored in
    encrypted format for security reasons. The pass-phrase is needed to be
    able to read and parse this file. When you can be sure that your server is
    secure enough you perform two steps:
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li>Remove the encryption from the RSA private key (while
       preserving the original file):
       <p>
       <code><strong>$ cp server.key server.key.org</strong></code><br>
       <code><strong>$ ssleay rsa -in server.key.org -out server.key</strong></code>
    <p>
    <li>Make sure the server.key file is now only readable by root:
       <p>
       <code><strong>$ chmod 400 server.key</strong></code>
    </ol>
    <p>
    Now <code>server.key</code> will contain an unencrypted copy of the key.
    If you point your server at this file it will not prompt you for a
    pass-phrase. HOWEVER, if anyone gets this key they will be able to
    impersonate you on the net. PLEASE make sure that the permissions on that
    file are really such that only root or the web server user can read it
    (preferably get your web server to start as root but run as another
    server, and have the key readable only by root).

    <a name="verify-key"></a>
    <strong id="faq">How do I verify that a private key matches its Certificate?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/docs/2.2/ssl_faq.html#verify-key"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    The private key contains a series of numbers. Two of those numbers form
    the "public key", the others are part of your "private key". The "public
    key" bits are also embedded in your Certificate (we get them from your
    CSR). To check that the public key in your cert matches the public
    portion of your private key, you need to view the cert and the key and
    compare the numbers. To view the Certificate and the key run the
    commands:
    <p>
    <code><strong>$ ssleay x509 -noout -text -in server.crt</strong></code><br>
    <code><strong>$ ssleay rsa -noout -text -in server.key</strong></code>
    <p>
    The `modulus' and the `public exponent' portions in the key and the
    Certificate must match. But since the public exponent is usually 65537
    and it's bothering comparing long modulus you can use the following
    approach:
    <p>
    <code><strong>$ ssleay x509 -noout -modulus -in server.crt | ssleay md5</strong></code><br>
    <code><strong>$ ssleay rsa -noout -modulus -in server.key | ssleay md5</strong></code>
    <p>
    And then compare these really shorter numbers. With overwhelming
    probability they will differ if the keys are different. BTW, if I want to
    check to which key or certificate a particular CSR belongs you can compute
    <p>
    <code><strong>$ ssleay req -noout -modulus -in server.csr | ssleay md5</strong></code>

    [<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/docs/2.2/ssl_faq.html#keysize"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    The private key sizes for SSL must be either 512 or 1024 for compatibility
    with certain web browsers. A keysize of 1024 bits is recommended because
    keys larger than 1024 bits are incompatible with some versions of Netscape
    Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, and with other browsers that
    use RSA's BSAFE cryptography toolkit.

    <p>
    The CA certificates under the path you configured with
    <code>SSLCACertificatePath</code> are found by SSLeay through hash
    symlinks. These hash values are generated by the `<code>ssleay x509 -noout
    -hash</code>' command. But the algorithm used to calculate the hash for a
    certificate has changed between SSLeay 0.8 and 0.9. So you have to remove
    all old hash symlinks and re-create new ones after upgrading. Use the
    <code>Makefile</code> mod_ssl placed into this directory.

    [<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/docs/2.2/ssl_faq.html#load"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    Because SSL uses strong cryptographic encryption and this needs a lot of
    number crunching. And because when you request a webpage via HTTPS even
    the images are transfered encrypted. So, when you have a lot of HTTPS
    traffic the load increases.

    [<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/docs/2.2/ssl_faq.html#ciphers"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    Usually just all SSL ciphers which are supported by the
    version of SSLeay in use (can depend on the way you built
    SSLeay). Typically this at least includes the following:
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>RC4 with MD5
    <li>RC4 with MD5 (export version restricted to 40-bit key)
    <li>RC2 with MD5
    <li>RC2 with MD5 (export version restricted to 40-bit key)
    <li>IDEA with MD5
    <li>DES with MD5
    <li>Triple-DES with MD5
    </ul>
    <p>
    To determine the actual list of supported ciphers you can
    run the following command:
    <p>
    <code><strong>$ ssleay ciphers -v</strong></code><br>

    [<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/docs/2.2/ssl_faq.html#vhosts"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    The reason is very technical. Actually it's some sort of a chicken and
    egg problem: The SSL protocol layer stays below the HTTP protocol layer
    and encapsulates HTTP. When an SSL connection (HTTPS) is established
    Apache/mod_ssl has to negotiate the SSL protocol parameters with the
    client. For this mod_ssl has to consult the configuration of the virtual
    server (for instance it has to look for the cipher suite, the server
    certificate, etc.). But in order to dispatch to the correct virtual server
    Apache has to know the <code>Host</code> HTTP header field. For this the
    HTTP request header has to be read. This cannot be done before the SSL
    handshake is finished. But the information is already needed at the SSL
    handshake phase. Bingo!

    <strong id="faq">When I use Basic Authentication over HTTPS the lock icon in Netscape browsers

    [<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/docs/2.2/ssl_faq.html#lock-icon"><b>L</b></a>]
    <p>
    No, the username/password is already transmitted encrypted. The icon in
    Netscape browsers is just not really synchronized with the SSL/TLS layer
    (it toggles to the locked state when the first part of the actual webpage
    data is transferred which is not quite correct) and this way confuses
    people. The Basic Authentication facility is part of the HTTP layer and
    this layer is above the SSL/TLS layer in HTTPS. And before any HTTP data
    communication takes place in HTTPS the SSL/TLS layer has already done the
    handshake phase and switched to encrypted communication. So, don't get
    confused by this icon.

    First look inside the F.A.Q. (this text), perhaps your problem is such
    popular that it was already answered a lot of times in the past.
<p>
<li><em>Postings from the sw-mod-ssl Support Mailing List</em>
    <a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/news/list.html">
    http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/news/list.html</a><br>
    Second search for your problem in one of the existing archives of the
    sw-mod-ssl mailing list. Perhaps your problem popped up at least once for
    another user, too.
<p>
<li><em>Problem Reports in the Bug Database</em>
    <a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/bugdb/">

you just like most, please.
<p>
<ol>
<li><em>Write a Problem Report into the Bug Database</em><br>
    <a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/bugdb/">
    http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mod_ssl/bugdb/</a><br>
    This is the preferred way of submitting your problem report, because this
    way it gets filed into the bug database (it cannot be lost) <em>and</em>
    send to the sw-mod-ssl mailing list (others see the current problems and
    learn from answers).
<p>
<li><em>Write a Problem Report to the sw-mod-ssl Support Mailing List</em><br>
    <a href="mailto:sw-mod-ssl@engelschall.com">
    sw-mod-ssl&nbsp;@&nbsp;engelschall.com</a><br>
    This is the second way of submitting your problem report. You have to
    subscribe to the list first, but then you can easily discuss your problem
    with both the author and the whole mod_ssl user community.
<p>
<li><em>Write a Problem Report to the author</em><br>
    <a href="mailto:rse@engelschall.com">
    rse&nbsp;@&nbsp;engelschall.com</a><br>
    This is the last way of submitting your problem report. Please avoid this
    in your own interest because the author is really a very busy men. Your
    mail will always be filed to one of his various mail-folders and is
    usually not processed as fast as a posting on sw-mod-ssl.

    <p>
You have to at least always provide the following information:
<p>
<ul>
<li><em>Apache, mod_ssl and SSLeay version information</em><br>
    The mod_ssl version you should really know. It's for instance the version
    number in the distribution tarball. The Apache version can be determined
    by running ``<code>httpd -v</code>''. The SSLeay version can be
    determined by running ``<code>ssleay version</code>''. Alternatively when
    you have Lynx installed you can run the command ``<code>lynx -mime_header
    http://localhost/ | grep Server</code>'' to determine all information in a
    single step.
<p>
<li><em>The details on how you built and installed Apache+mod_ssl+SSLeay</em><br>
    For this you can provide a logfile of your terminal session which shows
    the configuration and install steps. Alternatively you can at least
    provide the author with the APACI `<code>configure</code>'' command line
    you used (assuming you used APACI, of course).
<p>
<li><em>In case of core dumps please include a Backtrace</em><br>
    In case your Apache+mod_ssl+SSLeay should really dumped core please attach
    a stack-frame ``backtrace'' (see the next question on how to get it).
    Without this information the reason for your core dump cannot be found.
    So you have to provide the backtrace, please.
<p>
<li><em>A detailed description of your problem</em><br>
    Don't laugh, I'm totally serious. I already got a lot of problem reports
    where the people not really said what's the actual problem is. So, in your
    own interest (you want the problem be solved, don't you?) include as much
    details as possible, please. But start with the essentials first, of
    course.

    <p>
Follow the following steps:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have debugging symbols available in at least
    Apache and mod_ssl. On platforms where you use GCC/GDB you have to build
    Apache+mod_ssl with ``<code>OPTIM="-g -ggdb3"</code>'' to achieve this. On
    other platforms at least ``<code>OPTIM="-g"</code>'' is needed.
<p>
<li>Startup the server and try to produce the core-dump. For this you perhaps
    want to use a directive like ``<code>CoreDumpDirectory /tmp</code>'' to
    make sure that the core-dump file can be written. You then should get a
    <code>/tmp/core</code> or <code>/tmp/httpd.core</code> file. When you
    don't get this, try to run your server under an UID != 0 (root), because
    some kernels don't write (for security reasons) core-dumps for
    root-processes. Additionally you can run ``<code>/path/to/httpd -X</code>''
    manually to force Apache not not fork.
<p>
<li>Analyze the core-dump. For this run ``<code>gdb /path/to/httpd
    /tmp/httpd.core</code>'' or a similar command has to run. In GDB you then
    just have to enter the ``<code>bt</code>'' command and, voila, you get the
    backtrace. For other debuggers consult your local debugger manual. Send
    this backtrace to the author.
