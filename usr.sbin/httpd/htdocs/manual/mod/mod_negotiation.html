<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Module mod_negotiation</H1>

This module is contained in the <CODE>mod_negotiation.c</CODE> file,
and is compiled in by default. It provides for <A
HREF="../content-negotiation.html">content negotiation</A>.

<H2>Summary</H2>
Content negotiation, or more accurately content selection, is the
selection of the document that best matches the clients
capabilities, from one of several available documents.
There are two implementations of this.
<UL>
<LI> A type map (a file with the handler <CODE>type-map</CODE>)
which explicitly lists the files containing the variants.
<LI> A MultiViews search (enabled by the MultiViews
<A HREF="core.html#options">Option</A>, where the server does an implicit
filename pattern match, and choose from amongst the results.
</UL>

<H3>Type maps</H3>
A type map has the same format as RFC822 mail headers. It contains document
descriptions separated by blank lines, with lines beginning with a hash
character ('#') treated as comments. A document description consists of
several header records; records may be continued on multiple lines if the
continuation lines start with spaces. The leading space will be deleted
and the lines concatenated. A header record consists of a keyword
name, which always ends in a colon, followed by a value. Whitespace is allowed
between the header name and value, and between the tokens of value.

The headers allowed are:

<DL>
<DT>Content-Encoding:
<DD>The encoding of the file. Currently only two encodings are recognized
by http; <CODE>x-compress</CODE> for compressed files, and <CODE>x-gzip</CODE>
for gzipped files.
<DT>Content-Language:
<DD>The language of the variant, as an Internet standard language code, such
as <CODE>en</CODE>.
<DT>Content-Length:
<DD>The length of the file, in bytes. If this header is not present, then
the actual length of the file is used.
<DT>Content-Type:
<DD>The MIME media type of the document, with optional parameters.
parameters are separated from the media type and from one another by
semi-colons. Parameter syntax is name=value; allowed parameters are:
<DL>
<DT>level
<DD>the value is an integer, which specifies the version of the media type.
For <CODE>text/html</CODE> this defaults to 2, otherwise 0.
<DT>qs
<DD>the value is a floating-point number with value between 0. and 1.
It indications the 'quality' of this variant.
</DL>
Example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>Content-Type: image/jpeg; qs=0.8</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<DT>URI:
<DD>The path to the file containing this variant, relative to the map file.
</DL>

<H3>MultiViews</H3>
A MultiViews search is enabled by the MultiViews
<A HREF="core.html#options">Option</A>.
If the server receives a request for <CODE>/some/dir/foo</CODE> and
<CODE>/some/dir/foo</CODE> does <EM>not</EM> exist, then the server reads the
directory looking for all files named <CODE>foo.*</CODE>, and effectively
fakes up a type map which names all those files, assigning them the same media
types and content-encodings it would have if the client had asked for
one of them by name.  It then chooses the best match to the client's
requirements, and returns that document.<P>

><STRONG>Compatibility:</STRONG></A> CacheNegotiatedDocs is only available
in Apache 1.1 and later.<P>

<P>If set, this directive allows content-negotiated documents to be
cached by proxy servers. This could mean that clients behind those
proxys could retrieve versions of the documents that are not the best
match for their abilities, but it will make caching more
efficient.
<P>

This directive only applies to requests which come from HTTP/1.0 browsers.
HTTP/1.1 provides much better control over the caching of negotiated
documents, and this directive has no effect in responses to
HTTP/1.1 requests.

The LanguagePriority sets the precedence of language variants for the case
where the client does not express a preference, when handling a
MultiViews request. The list of <EM>MIME-lang</EM> are in order of decreasing
preference. Example:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>LanguagePriority en fr de</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

For a request for <CODE>foo.html</CODE>, where <CODE>foo.html.fr</CODE>
and <CODE>foo.html.de</CODE> both existed, but the browser did not express
a language preference, then <CODE>foo.html.fr</CODE> would be returned.<P>

<P>

Note that this directive only has an effect if a 'best' language
cannot be determined by other any other means. Correctly implemented
HTTP/1.1 requests will mean this directive has no effect.
