<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">Module mod_info</h1>

This module is contained in the <code>mod_info.c</code> file.  It
provides a comprehensive overview of the server configuration
including all installed modules and directives in the configuration
files.  This module is not compiled into the
server by default.  It is only available in Apache 1.1 and later. To
enable it, add the following line to the server build Configuration
file, and rebuild the server:

<PRE>
Module info_module   mod_info.o
</PRE>

<HR>
<P>
To configure it, add the following to your <code>access.conf</code> file.

<PRE>
&lt;Location /server-info&gt;
SetHandler server-info
&lt;/Location&gt;
</PRE>

You may wish to add a
<A
 HREF="core.html#limit"
>&lt;Limit&gt;</A>
clause inside the
<A
 HREF="core.html#location"
>location</A>
directive to limit access to your server configuration information.<p>
Once configured, the server information is obtained by accessing
<tt>http://your.host.dom/server-info</tt><p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 <STRONG>
  Note that the configuration files are read by the module at run-time,
  and therefore the display may <EM>not</EM> reflect the running
  server's active configuration if the files have been changed since the
  server was last reloaded.  Also, the configuration files must be
  readable by the user as which the server is running (see the
  <A
   HREF="core.html#user"
  ><SAMP>User</SAMP></A>
  directive), or else the directive settings will not be listed.
  <P>
  It should also be noted that if <SAMP>mod_info</SAMP> is compiled into
  the server, its handler capability is available in <EM>all</EM>
  configuration files, including <EM>per</EM>-directory files
  (<EM>e.g.</EM>, <SAMP>.htaccess</SAMP>).  This may have
  security-related ramifications for your site.
