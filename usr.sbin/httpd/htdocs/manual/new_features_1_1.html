    <h1 align="CENTER">Overview of new features</h1>

    <h2>API Changes</h2>
    A few changes to the Apache API were made for 1.1. It is
    possible that some third-party modules will no longer work with
    1.1, though we have made every effort to provide
    backwards-compatibility. If you encounter a module that does
    not work with 1.1, please <a
    href="http://httpd.apache.org/bug_report.html">let us know</a>.
    

    <h2>New Features with Apache 1.1</h2>

    <p>New features with this release, as extensions of the Apache
    functionality (see also more detailed <code>CHANGES</code> file
    in the source directory.) Because the core code has changed so
    significantly, there are certain liberties that earlier
    versions of Apache (and the NCSA daemon) took that recent
    Apache versions are pickier about - please check the <a
    href="misc/compat_notes.html">compatibility notes</a> if you
    have any problems.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>In addition to a number of bug fixes and internal
    performance enhancements, <a
    href="http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/">Apache 1.1</a> has the
    following specific new user features:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong><a href="keepalive.html">Support for Keep-Alive
      Persistent Connections</a></strong><br />
       Apache now has (optional) support for persistent
      connections, as defined by the HTTP/1.1 draft. This protocol,
      supported by a number of current HTTP servers and browsers
      (including Netscape Navigator 2.0) has been shown to increase
      speed of document transfer by up to 50% in certain
      cases.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="vhosts/">New non-IP
      Intensive-VirtualHost Support</a></strong><br />
       Apache's support for virtual hosts has been enhanced to be
      able to use information sent by some new Web browsers to
      determine the server being accessed, without requiring an
      additional IP address for each host.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="bind.html">Listen to Multiple Addresses
      and Ports</a></strong><br />
       Using the new <code>Listen</code> directive, Apache can
      listen to more than one port and IP address, using the same
      configuration set.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_status.html">Status
      Module</a></strong><br />
       Apache now contains a module that gives the web-master
      accurate, up-to-date information about the server's status
      and its resource consumption. It also gives the current state
      of each server process including the current URL being
      processed. For an example, check out <a
      href="http://www.apache.org/status">the status of the
      www.apache.org server</a>.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_info.html">Server Information
      Module</a></strong> This module gives a plethora of
      information about the other modules installed, their
      directives, and their configurations. It is extremely helpful
      in debugging configuration problems. For an example, check
      out <a href="http://www.apache.org/serv-info">information
      about the www.apache.org server</a>.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_proxy.html">Experimental Caching
      Proxy Server</a></strong><br />
       Apache can now act as an HTTP proxy server, allowing clients
      behind firewalls to use the server to access the outside
      world. In addition, it can cache documents it proxies,
      speeding up access to frequently requested documents.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="location.html">URL-based Access
      Protection</a></strong><br />
       In addition to access checking and authorization by filename
      (with <code><a
      href="mod/core.html#directory">&lt;Directory&gt;</a></code>),
      the new <code>&lt;Location&gt;</code> directive allows
      protection by URL.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_actions.html">Filetype-based
      Script "Actions"</a></strong><br />
       You can now run CGI scripts whenever a file of a certain
      type is requested. This makes it much easier to execute
      scripts that process files. In addition, you can use the new
      <a href="mod/mod_actions.html#script">Script</a> directive to
      enable scripts for files called with HTTP methods Apache does
      not natively support.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="handler.html">New "Handler"
      Directives</a></strong><br />
       The new <code>AddHandler</code> and <code>SetHandler</code>
      directive allows "handlers" to be defined for filename
      extensions or directories. These handlers, which can either
      be built into Apache or added with the <a
      href="mod/mod_actions.html">Action</a> directive, extend
      Apache's range of usability, and almost entirely remove the
      "magic" media types.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_env.html">Customizable CGI
      Environment Variables</a></strong><br />
       New <code>PassEnv</code> and <code>SetEnv</code> directives
      allow you to modify the environment variables passed to CGI
      scripts.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_cern_meta.html">CERN Metafile
      Support</a></strong><br />
       Now emulates the CERN httpd's support for metafiles
      containing additional HTTP headers to be supplied with a
      document.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_imap.html">Improved Imagemap
      Support</a></strong><br />
       The internal imagemap handling code has been rewritten and
      reorganized, adding new handling of default, base and
      relative URLs, and support for creating non-graphical menus
      for use with clients that do not support imagemaps.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_userdir.html">Improved UserDir
      Directive</a></strong><br />
       Now supports the ability to point user's files (as specified
      by URLs beginning with the "<code>~</code>" character) at
      directories other than those specified by the Unix password
      file.</li>

      <li><strong>Minimal DNS Now Runtime Option</strong><br />
       New <code>HostnameLookups</code> server configuration
      directive can be used to turn <code>On</code> or
      <code>Off</code> DNS lookups. This supersedes the
      -DMINIMAL_DNS compile-time configuration option. This option
      can be set per-directory.</li>

      <li><strong>IdentityCheck Now Per-Directory
      Option</strong><br />
       The <code>IdentityCheck</code> directive, which controls the
      use of ident to check the remote user name, can now be set
      per directory. The ident support is also RFC
      1413-compliant.</li>

      <li><strong>Redirect Now Usable in <code>.htaccess</code>
      Files</strong><br />
       The <a
      href="mod/mod_alias.html#redirect"><code>Redirect</code></a>
      directive can now be used in <code>.htaccess</code> files
      when the <code>FileInfo</code> directive has been set on.
      This allows users to redirect parts of their directories
      without requiring CGI scripts</li>

      <li><strong>ErrorDocument Now Usable in
      <code>.htaccess</code> Files</strong><br />
       The <a
      href="custom-error.html"><code>ErrorDocument</code></a>
      directive can now be used in <code>.htaccess</code> files
      when the <code>FileInfo</code> directive has been set on.
      This allows users to have different error messages for
      different sections of a site.</li>

      <li><strong><code>ForceType</code> Directive</strong><br />
       This new directive, in <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code>
      sections or .htaccess files, allows you to override the
      filename extensions and force a single content type.
      (<em>e.g.</em>, <code>ForceType
      application/octet-stream</code>)</li>

      <li><strong>File Owner Available to Included CGI
      Scripts</strong><br />
       Server-side includes that call CGI scripts will now set a
      <code>USER_NAME</code> environment variable that contains the
      owner of the file which included it.</li>

      <li><strong>Improved Icons</strong><br />
       Thanks to <a href="mailto:kevinh@eit.com">Kevin Hughes</a>,
      Apache's nifty color GIF icons for directory listings have
      been updated. In addition, the <a
      href="../apache_pb.gif">Powered by Apache</a>
      (<code>apache_pb.gif</code>) logo has been included.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />

    <h3>New Authentication Modules</h3>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> These modules are not compiled into
    the server by default, as they require special support on the
    host system. They must be enabled specifically in the
    <code>Configuration</code> file.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_auth_anon.html">Anonymous HTTP
      Logins</a></strong><br />
       New options allow you to allow, using Basic HTTP
      Authentication, anonymous logins, like those of FTP. This
      allows you to collect email addresses of people accessing
      your site.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_digest.html">Support for Digest
      Authentication</a></strong><br />
       Apache now supports digest authentication using RSA MD5
      encryption. When used with a supporting web browser, this
      provides a more secure alternative to Basic
      authentication.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_auth_db.html">Support for Unix
      DB Authentication</a></strong> -
      <code>mod_auth_db.c</code><br />
       In addition to <a href="mod/mod_auth_dbm.html">DBM</a>
      support, Apache now contains optional support for Berkeley DB
      databases.</li>

      <li><strong>mSQL Database Authentication</strong> -
      <code>mod_auth_msql.html</code><br />
       Support for the use of mSQL databases for user
      authentication via HTTP is now supported.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />

    <h3>OS/2 Support</h3>

    <p>Apache now includes support for OS/2, thanks to <a
    href="http://www.slink.com/ApacheOS2/">Softlink
    Services</a>.</p>
