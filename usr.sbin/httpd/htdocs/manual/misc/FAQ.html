    <p>The latest version of this FAQ is always available from the
    main Apache web site, at &lt;<a

    <!--  - If adding a relative link to another part of the            -->
    <!--    documentation, *do* include the ".html" portion.  There's a -->
    <!--    good chance that the user will be reading the documentation -->
    <!--    on his own system, which may not be configured for          -->
    <!--    multiviews.                                                 -->
    <!--  - When adding items, make sure they're put in the right place -->
    <!--    - verify that the numbering matches up.                     -->
    <!--  - *Don't* use <PRE></PRE> blocks - they don't appear          -->
    <!--    correctly in a reliable way when this is converted to text  -->
    <!--    with Lynx.  Use <DL><DD><CODE>xxx<BR>xx</CODE></DD></DL>    -->
    <!--    blocks inside a <P></P> instead.  This is necessary to get  -->
    <!--    the horizontal and vertical indenting right.                -->
    <!--  - Don't forget to include an HR tag after the last /P tag     -->
    <!--    but before the /LI in an item.                              -->

    <p>If you are reading a text-only version of this FAQ, you may
    find numbers enclosed in brackets (such as "[12]"). These refer
