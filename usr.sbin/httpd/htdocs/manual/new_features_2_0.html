<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Overview of New Features in Apache 2.0</H1>

<P>New features with this release, as extensions of the Apache
functionality. Because the core code has changed so
significantly, there are certain liberties that earlier versions of
Apache (and the NCSA daemon) took that recent Apache versions are
pickier about - when Apache 2.0 is released, there will be more notes
on how to correct those issues.

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>New Build System</STRONG>
<DD>The entire build system has been completely redesigned to take
    advantage of autoconf and libtool.  This makes it more likely that
    DSO's will work on more systems.

<DT><STRONG>Improved Portability</STRONG>
<DD>Apache now takes advantage of native system calls on all supported
    platforms.  This improves performance and reduces bugs.

<DT><STRONG>Multi-Threading</STRONG>
<DD>Apache 2.0 has the option of being multi-process and multi-threaded
    on most platforms.

<DT><STRONG>Apache Portable Runtime</STRONG>
<DD>The Apache Portable Runtime allow Apache to easily port to more and more
    systems.  This has however caused a major code re-organization.
