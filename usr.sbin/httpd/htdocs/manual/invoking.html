<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Starting Apache</H1>

<H2>Invoking Apache</H2>

On Unix, the <CODE>httpd</CODE> program is usually run as a daemon
which executes continuously, handling requests.  It is possible to
invoke Apache by the Internet daemon <CODE>inetd</CODE> each time a
connection to the HTTP service is made (use the <A
HREF="mod/core.html#servertype">ServerType</A> directive) but this is
not recommended.

<P>

On Windows, Apache is normally run as a service on Windows NT, or as a
console application on Windows 95. See also <A
HREF="windows.html#run">running Apache for Windows</A>.

<H2>Command line options</H2>
The following options are recognized on the httpd command line:
<DL>
<DT><CODE>-d</CODE> <EM>serverroot</EM>
<DD>Set the initial value for the
<A HREF="mod/core.html#serverroot">ServerRoot</A> variable to
<EM>serverroot</EM>. This can be overridden by the ServerRoot command
in the configuration file. The default is
<CODE>/usr/local/apache</CODE> on Unix, <CODE>/apache</CODE> on
Windows and <CODE>/os2httpd</CODE> on OS/2.

<DT><CODE>-D</CODE> <EM>name</EM>
<DD>Define a name for use in in 
<A HREF="mod/core.html#ifdefine">IfDefine</A> directives.
This option can be used to optionally enable certain functionality in the
configuration file, or to use a common configuration for
several independent hosts, where host specific information is enclosed in
&lt;IfDefine&gt; sections.

<DT><CODE>-f</CODE> <EM>config</EM>
<DD>Execute the commands in the file <EM>config</EM> on startup. If
<EM>config</EM> does not begin with a <CODE>/</CODE>, then it is taken to be a
path relative to the <A HREF="mod/core.html#serverroot">ServerRoot</A>. The
default is <CODE>conf/httpd.conf</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-C</CODE> <EM>"directive"</EM>
<DD>Process the given apache "directive" (just as if it had been part of a
configuration file) <STRONG>before</STRONG> actually reading the regular configuration files.

<DT><CODE>-c</CODE> <EM>"directive"</EM>
<DD>Process the given apache "directive" <STRONG>after</STRONG> reading
all the regular configuration files.

<DT><CODE>-X</CODE>
<DD>Run in single-process mode, for internal debugging purposes only; the
daemon does not detach from the terminal or fork any children. Do <EM>NOT</EM>
use this mode to provide ordinary web service.

<DT><CODE>-v</CODE>
<DD>Print the version of httpd and its build date, and then exit.

<DT><A NAME="version"><CODE>-V</CODE></A>
<DD>Print the base version of httpd, its
build date, and a list of compile time settings which influence the
behavior and performance of the apache server (<EM>e.g.</EM>,
<SAMP>-DUSE_MMAP_FILES</SAMP>),
then exit.

<DT><CODE>-L</CODE>
<DD>

Give a list of directives together with expected arguments and places
where the directive is valid, then exit.  (Apache 1.3.4 and
later. Earlier versions used -l instead).


<DT><CODE>-l</CODE>
<DD>

Give a list of all modules compiled into the server, then exit.
(Apache 1.3.4 and later. Earlier versions used -h instead).<br>

Give a list of directives together with expected arguments and places
where the directive is valid, then exit. (Apache 1.2 to 1.3.3. Later
versions use -L instead).



<DT><A NAME="help"><CODE>-h</CODE></A>
<DD>

Print a list of the httpd options, then exit. (Apache 1.3.4 and
later. Earlier versions used -? instead).<br>

Give a list of all modules compiled into the server, then exit. (Up to
Apache 1.3.3. Later versions use -l instead).<br>


<DT><CODE>-S</CODE>
<DD>Show the settings as parsed from the config file (currently only
shows a breakdown of the vhost settings) but do not start the
server. (Up to Apache 1.3.3, this option also started the server).

<DT><CODE>-t</CODE>
<DD>Test the configuration file syntax (<EM>i.e.</EM>, read all configuration files
and interpret them) but do not start the server. If the configuration contains
errors, display an error message and exit with a non-zero exit status,
otherwise display "Syntax OK" and terminate with a zero exit status. This
command checks to see if all DocumentRoot entries exist and are directories.
For sites with many vhosts, this is expensive; consider the <CODE>-T</CODE>
command instead.

<DT><CODE>-T</CODE>
<DD>Test the configuration file syntax (<EM>i.e.</EM>, read all configuration files
and interpret them) but do not start the server. If the configuration contains
errors, display an error message and exit with a non-zero exit status,
otherwise display "Syntax OK" and terminate with a zero exit status. This
command does not perform any checking of the DocumentRoot entries.

<DT><CODE>-k</CODE> <EM>option</EM>
<DD>Windows only: signal Apache to restart or shutdown. <EM>option</EM> 
is one of "shutdown" or "restart". (Apache 1.3.3 and later).

<DT><CODE>-?</CODE>
<DD>Print a list of the httpd options, and then exit (up to Apache
1.3.3. Later version use -h instead).
