.Sh NAME
.Nm slowcgi
.Nd a FastCGI to CGI wrapper server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl s Ar socket
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a server which implements the FastCGI Protocol to execute CGI scripts.
FastCGI was designed to overcome the CGI protocol's scalability
and resource sharing limitations.
While CGI scripts need to be forked for every request, FastCGI scripts
can be kept running and handle many HTTP requests.
.Pp
.Xr nginx 8
intentionally does not implement the CGI protocol.
.Nm
is a simple server that translates FastCGI requests coming from
.Xr nginx 8
to the CGI protocol.
It executes the requested CGI script and translates its output back to the
FastCGI protocol.
.Pp
Modern web frameworks and web applications usually come with the
capability to run as FastCGI servers.
.Nm
is not intended for these applications.
.Pp
.Nm
opens a socket at
.Pa /var/www/run/slowcgi.sock ,
owned by root:www,
with permissions 0660.
It will then
.Xr chroot 8
to
.Pa /var/www
and drop privileges to user
.Qq www .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to stderr.
.It Fl s Ar socket
Create and bind to alternative local socket at
.Ar socket .

.Nm
only implements the parts of the FastCGI standard needed to execute
CGI scripts.
This is intentional.
