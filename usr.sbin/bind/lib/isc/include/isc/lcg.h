 * Theo de Raadt <deraadt@openbsd.org> came up with the idea of using
 * such a mathematical system to generate more random (yet non-repeating)
 * ids to solve the resolver/named problem.  But Niels designed the
 * actual system based on the constraints.
 */

/*
 * seed = random 15bit
 * n = prime, g0 = generator to n,
 * j = random so that gcd(j,n-1) == 1
 * g = g0^j mod n will be a generator again.
 *
 * X[0] = random seed.
 * X[n] = a*X[n-1]+b mod m is a Linear Congruential Generator
 * with a = 7^(even random) mod m, 
 *      b = random with gcd(b,m) == 1
 *      m = 31104 and a maximal period of m-1.
 *
 * The transaction id is determined by:
 * id[n] = seed xor (g^X[n] mod n)
 *
 * Effectivly the id is restricted to the lower 15 bits, thus
 * yielding two different cycles by toggling the msb on and off.
 * This avoids reuse issues caused by reseeding.
 *
 * The 16 bit space is very small and brute force attempts are
 * entirly feasible, we skip a random number of transaction ids
 * so that an attacker will not get sequential ids.
