 * of "b.c" caused the node "a.b.c" to be split, pushing "a" to its own level,
 * then the subsequent deletion of "b.c" will not cause "a" to be pulled up,
 * restoring "a.b.c".  The RBT *used* to do this kind of rejoining, but it
 * turned out to be a bad idea because it could corrupt an active nodechain
 * that had "b.c" as one of its levels -- and the RBT has no idea what
 * nodechains are in use by callers, so it can't even *try* to helpfully
 * fix them up (which would probably be doomed to failure anyway).
 *
 * Similarly, it is possible to leave the tree in a state where a supposedly
 * deleted node still exists.  The first case of this is obvious; take
 * the tree which has "b.c" on one level, pointing to "a".  Now deleted "b.c".
 * It was just established in the previous paragraph why we can't pull "a"
 * back up to its parent level.  But what happens when "a" then gets deleted?
 * "b.c" is left hanging around without data or children.  This condition
 * is actually pretty easy to detect, but ... should it really be removed?
 * Is a chain pointing to it?  An iterator?  Who knows!  (Note that the
 * references structure member cannot be looked at because it is private to
 * rbtdb.)  This is ugly and makes me unhappy, but after hours of trying to
 * make it more aesthetically proper and getting nowhere, this is the way it
 * is going to stay until such time as it proves to be a *real* problem.
 *
 * Finally, for reference, note that the original routine that did node
 * joining was called join_nodes().  It has been excised, living now only
