.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility details the route IPv6 packets take to reach a network host.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl A
Look up the AS number for each hop address.
Uses the DNS service described at
.Lk http://www.team-cymru.org/Services/ip-to-asn.html .
.It Fl c
Do not increment the destination port number in successive UDP packets.
Rather, all UDP packets will have the same destination port, as set via the
.Fl p
flag (or 33434 if none is specified).
.It Fl D
Dump the packet data to standard error before transmitting it.
.It Fl d
Debug mode.
.It Fl f Ar firsthop
Specify how many hops to skip.
.It Fl g Ar gateway
Specify an intermediate gateway
.Po
.Nm
uses a routing header
.Pc .
.It Fl I
Use ICMP6 ECHO instead of UDP datagrams.
.It Fl l
Display the hop limit value of the returned packet.
This is useful for checking for asymmetric routing.
.It Fl m Ar hoplimit
Specify a maximum hoplimit.
.It Fl n
Do not resolve numeric addresses.
.It Fl p Ar port
Set UDP port number to
.Ar port .
.It Fl q Ar probes
Set the number of probes per hop count to
.Ar probes .
.It Fl r
Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached
network.
If the host is not on a directly attached network,
an error is returned.
This option corresponds to the
.Dv SO_DONTROUTE
socket option;
it can be used to ping a local host through an interface
that has no route through it
(e.g. after the interface was dropped by a routing daemon).
.It Fl S
Print how many probes were not answered for each hop.
.It Fl s Ar src
Specify the source IPv6 address to be used.
.It Fl v
Be verbose.
.It Fl V Ar rtable
Set the routing table to be used.
.It Fl w Ar waittime
Specify the time delay between probes.
