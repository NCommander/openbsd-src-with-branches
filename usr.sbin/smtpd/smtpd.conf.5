.Sh NAME
.Nm smtpd.conf
.Nd Simple Mail Transfer Protocol daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to configure the
.Xr smtpd 8 ,
a small SMTP daemon.
.Pp
.Sh SMTPD.CONF FILE FORMAT
Lines beginning with
.Sq #
and empty lines are regarded as comments,
and ignored.
Lines may be split using the
.Sq \e
character.
.Pp
Additional configuration files can be included with the
.Ic include
keyword, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
include "/etc/mail/sub.smtpd.conf"
.Ed
.Sh MACROS
Macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, and may contain letters, digits
and underscores.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example
.Ar listen ,
.Ar accept ,
.Ar port ) .
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Pp
For example,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
smtp_port = 25
listen on 127.0.0.1 port $smtp_port
.Ed
.Sh EXPANSION
Some configuration directives expect expansion of their parameter at
runtime. Such directives (for example
.Ar deliver to mbox ,
.Ar deliver to maildir ,
.Ar deliver to mda ,
.Ar relay via )
may use format specifiers which will be expanded before delivery or
relaying. The following formats are currently supported:
%a expands to the user part of the email address prior to the
resolution of aliases, %u expands to the user part after aliases
resolution and will typically be the system account, %d expands to
the domain part of the email address.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example configures a machine to accept local delivery
for both localhost and example.com, as well as the relaying of mail
destined for example.org through the mx1.example.org server and mail
destined for example.net through regular MX records lookup:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset listen
.Pp
listen on 0.0.0.0 port 25
accept for domain "localhost" deliver to mbox "/var/mail/%u"
accept for domain "example.com" deliver to maildir "/home/%u/Maildir"
accept for domain "example.org" relay via "mx1.example.org"
accept for domain "example.net" relay
