.Dt FORWARD 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm forward
.Nd email forwarding information file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Users may put a
.Nm .forward
file in their home directory.
If this file exists,
.Xr smtpd 8
forwards email to the destinations specified therein.
.Pp
A
.Nm .forward
file contains a list of expansion values, as described in
.Xr aliases 5 .
Each expansion value should be on a line by itself.
However, the
.Nm .forward
mechanism differs from the aliases mechanism in that is disallows
file inclusion
.Pq :include:
and it performs expansion under the user ID of the
.Nm .forward
file owner.
.Pp
Permissions on the
.Nm .forward
file are very strict and expansion is rejected if the file is
group or world-writable;
if the home directory is group writeable;
or if the file is not owned by the user.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "~/.forwardXXX" -compact
.It Pa ~/.forward
Email forwarding information.

.Sh EXAMPLES
