.Dt FORWARD 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm forward
.Nd email forwarding information file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Users may put a
.Pa .forward
file in their home directory.
If this file exists,
.Xr smtpd 8
will expand it to new delivery envelopes.
.Pp
A
.Pa .forward
file contains one or more lines where each line is a valid expansion
value according to
.Xr aliases 5 .
However, the
.Pa .forward
mechanism differs from the aliases mechanism in that is disallows
file inclusion and it performs expansion under the user ID of the
.Pa .forward
file owner.
.Pp
Permissions on the
.Pa .forward
file are very strict and expansion will be rejected if file is
group or world-writable, if home directory is group writeable,
or if file is not owned by the user.
