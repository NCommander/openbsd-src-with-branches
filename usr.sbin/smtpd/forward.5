.Sh NAME

.Nd email forwarding information file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Users may put a file named
.Pa .forward
in their home directory.
If this file exists,
.Xr smtpd 8
will expand it to new delivery envelopes.
.Pp
A
.Pa .forward
file contains one or more lines where each line is a valid expansion
value according to
.Xr aliases 5 .
However, the
.Pa .forward
mechanism differs from the aliases mechanism in that is disallows
file inclusion and it performs expansion under the user ID of the
.Pa .forward
file owner.
.Pp
.Pa .forward
files must not be group or world writable.
The user's home directory should not be group writable.
The
.Pa .forward
file must be owned by and readable by the indicated user.
