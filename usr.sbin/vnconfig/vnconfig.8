.Sh NAME
.Nm vnconfig

.Ar special_file
.Ar regular_file

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm vnconfig
command configures vnode pseudo disk devices.
It will associate the special file 
.Ar special_file
with the regular file
.Ar regular_file
allowing the latter to be accessed as though it were a disk.
Hence a regular file within the filesystem can be used for swapping
or can contain a filesystem that is mounted in the name space.
.Pp
Options indicate an action to be performed:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c
Configures the device.
If successful, references to
.Ar special_file
will access the contents of
.Ar regular_file .
.It Fl u
Unconfigures the device.
.It Fl v
Print messages to stdout describing actions taken.
.El
.Pp
If no action option is given,
.Fl c
is assumed.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/rvnd?? -compact
