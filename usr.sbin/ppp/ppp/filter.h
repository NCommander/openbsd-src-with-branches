 * There's a struct filterent for each possible filter rule.  The
 * layout is designed to minimise size (there are 4 * MAXFILTERS of
 * them) - which is also conveniently a power of 2 (32 bytes) on
 * architectures where sizeof(int)==4 (this makes indexing faster).
 *
 * f_action and f_proto only need to be 6 and 3 bits, respectively,
 * but making them 8 bits allows them to be efficently accessed using
 * byte operations as well as allowing space for future expansion
 * (expanding MAXFILTERS or converting f_proto IPPROTO_... values).
 *
 * Note that there are four free bits in the initial word for future
 * extensions.
