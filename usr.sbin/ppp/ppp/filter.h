 * architectures where sizeof(int)==4 (this makes indexing faster).
 *
 * f_action and f_proto only need to be 6 and 3 bits, respectively,
 * but making them 8 bits allows them to be efficently accessed using
 * byte operations as well as allowing space for future expansion
 * (expanding MAXFILTERS or converting f_proto IPPROTO_... values).
 *
 * Note that there are four free bits in the initial word for future
