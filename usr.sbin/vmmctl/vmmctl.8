.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to control the virtual machine monitor (VMM) subsystem.
A VMM manages virtual machines (VMs) on a
.Ar host .
The VMM subsystem is responsible for creating, destroying, and executing
VMs.

.Sh VMM OPERATIONS
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Dsssigfile
.It Fl d
Disable the VMM subsystem. Virtual machines running on the host should be
terminated first.
.It Fl e
Enable the VMM subsystem. The VMM subsystem must be enabled before VMs
can be managed on the host.
.El
.Pp
Generally, the 
.Nm
utility is run with -e option during system startup to enable the VMM
subsystem on boot. This can be automated via the
.Xr rc 8
and
.Xr rc.conf 8
facilities used during system startup.
.Sh VM OPERATIONS
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Dsssignature
.It Fl C
Creates a VM disk image file with the specified pathname and size in MB.
.It Fl S
Starts a VM defined by the specified parameters.
.It Fl m
Memory size (in MB) of the VM
.It Fl n
Number of network interfaces to add to the VM
.It Fl b
Disk image file (may be specified multiple times to add multiple disk images).
.It Fl k
Kernel to load when booting the VM
.It Fl T
Terminates (stops) a VM defined by the specified VM ID.
.It Fl I
Lists VMs running on the host, optionally listing just the selected VM ID.
.El

.Bl -tag -width Dsssignature
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std vmmctl
.Nm
may fail due to one of the following reasons:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
The VMM subsystem could not be enabled or disabled as requested
.It
A requested VM-based operation could not be completed
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Enable the VMM subsystem
.Dl $ vmmctl -e
.Pp
Disable the VMM subsystem
.Dl $ vmmctl -d
.Pp
Create a new VM with 512MB memory, 1 network interface, one disk image
('disk.img') and boot from kernel '/bsd'.
.Dl $ vmmctl -S -m 512 -n 1 -b disk.img -k /bsd
.Pp
Terminate VM number 1
.Dl $ vmmctl -T1
