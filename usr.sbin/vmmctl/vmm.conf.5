.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm vmm.conf
.Nd virtual machine configuration
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file to configure the virtual machine monitor
(VMM) subsystem.
A VMM manages virtual machines (VMs) on a
.Ar host .
The VMM subsystem is responsible for creating, destroying, and
executing VMs.
.Sh SECTIONS
.Nm
is divided into three main sections:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sy Macros
User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sy VMM Configuration
Global settings for the
.Xr vmm 4
subsystem.
.It Sy VM Configuration
Configuration for each individual virtual machine.
.El
.Pp
Within the sections,
the current line can be extended over multiple lines using a backslash
.Pq Sq \e .
Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark
.Pq Sq # ,
and extend to the end of the current line.
Care should be taken when commenting out multi-line text:
the comment is effective until the end of the entire block.
.Pp
Argument names not beginning with a letter, digit, or underscore
must be quoted.
.Pp
Additional configuration files can be included with the
.Ic include
keyword, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
include "/etc/vm1.example.com.conf"
.Ed
.Sh MACROS
Macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, digit, or underscore,
and may contain any of those characters.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example,
.Ic vm ,
.Ic memory ,
or
.Ic disk ) .
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ramdisk="/bsd.rd"
vm "vm1.example.com" {
	memory 512M
	kernel $ramdisk
}
.Ed
.Sh VMM CONFIGURATION
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm vmm disable
Disable the VMM subsystem.
Virtual machines running on the host should be terminated first.
.It Cm vmm enable
Enable the VMM subsystem.
The VMM subsystem must be enabled before VMs can be managed on the host.
.El
.Pp
Generally, the
.Nm
utility is run with
.Cm enable
option during system startup to enable the VMM subsystem on boot.
This can be automated via the
.Xr rc 8
and
.Xr rc.conf 8
facilities used during system startup.
.Sh VM CONFIGURATION
Each
.Ic vm
section starts with a declaration of the virtual machine
.Ar name :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic vm Ar name Brq ...
This name can be any string, and is typically a hostname.
.El
.Pp
Followed by a block of parameters that is enclosed in curly brackets:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm enable
Automatically start the VM.
This is the default if neither
.Cm enable
nor
.Cm disable
is specified.
.It Cm disable
Do not start this VM.
.It Cm disk Ar path
Disk image file (may be specified multiple times to add multiple disk images).
.It Cm kernel Ar path
Kernel to load when booting the VM.
.It Cm memory Ar size
Memory size of the VM, in bytes, rounded to megabytes.
Optionally, the units 'K', 'M', or 'G', for kilo-, mega-, and gigabytes
can be used.
.It Cm interfaces Ar count
Number of network interfaces to add to the VM.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Enable the VMM subsystem:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
vmm enable
.Ed
.Pp
Create a new VM with 512MB memory, 1 network interface, one disk image
('disk.img') and boot from kernel '/bsd':
.Bd -literal -offset indent
vm "vm2.example.com" {
	memory 512M
	interfaces 1
	disk "/var/vmm/vm2-disk.img"
	kernel "/bsd"
}
