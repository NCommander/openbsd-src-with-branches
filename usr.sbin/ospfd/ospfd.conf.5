.Sh NAME
.Nm ospfd.conf
.Nd Open Shortest Path First daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr ospfd 8
daemon implements the Open Shortest Path First protocol version 2 as described
in RFC 2328.
.Sh SECTIONS
The
.Nm
config file is divided into three main sections.
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sy Macros
User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sy Global Configuration
Global settings for
.Xr ospfd 8 .
A number of global settings can be overruled in specific areas or interfaces.
.It Sy Areas
An OSPF router must be a member of at least one area.
Areas are used to group interfaces, simplifying configuration.
.El
.Sh MACROS
Macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, and may contain letters, digits,
and underscores.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example,
.Ic area ,
.Ic interface ,
or
.Ic hello-interval ) .
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hi="5"
area 0.0.0.0 {
	interface em0 {
		hello-interval $hi
	}
}
.Ed
.Pp
The same can be accomplished by specifying the hello-interval
globally or within the area declaration.
.Sh GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
All interface related settings can be configured globally, per area and per
interface.
The only settings that can be set globally and not overruled are listed below.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic fib-update
.Pq Ic yes Ns \&| Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic \&no ,
do not update the Forwarding Information Base, a.k.a. the kernel
routing table.
The default is
.Ic yes .
Setting
.Ic fib-update
to
.Ic \&no
will implicitly set the
.Ic stub Ic router
option to ensure that no trafic tries to transit via this router.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Op Ic no
.Ic redistribute
.Sm off
.Po Ic static Ns \&| Ns Ic connected Ns \&| Ns
.Ic default Pc
.Sm on
.Op Ic set ...\&
.Xc
.It Xo
.Op Ic no
.Ic redistribute Ar prefix Op Ic set ...\&
.Xc
.It Xo
.Op Ic no
.Ic redistribute rtlabel Ar label Op Ic set ...\&
.Xc
If set to
.Ic connected ,
routes to directly attached networks will be announced over OSPF.
If set to
.Ic static ,
static routes will be announced over OSPF.
If set to
.Ic default ,
a default route pointing to this router will be announced over OSPF.
It is possible to specify a network range with
.Ar prefix ;
networks need to be part of that range to be redistributed.
Additionally it is possible to redistribute based on route labels
using the
.Ic rtlabel
keyword.
By default no additional routes will be announced over OSPF.
.Pp
.Ic redistribute
statements are evaluated in sequential order, from first to last.
The first matching rule decides if a route should be redistributed or not.
Matching rules starting with
.Ic no
will force the route to be not announced.
The only exception is
.Ic default ,
which will be set no matter what, and additionally
.Ic no
cannot be used together with it.
.Pp
It is possible to set the route
.Ic metric
and
.Ic type
for each redistribute rule.
.Ic type
is either 1 or 2.
The default value for
.Ic type
is 1 and for
.Ic metric
is 100.
Setting more then one option needs curly brackets:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
redistribute static set { metric 300 type 2 }
.Ed
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic rfc1583compat
.Pq Ic yes Ns \&| Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic yes ,
decisions regarding AS-external routes are evaluated according to RFC 1583.
The default is
.Ic no .
.Pp
.It Ic router-id Ar address
Set the router ID; if not specified, the lowest IP address of the router
will be used.
.Pp
.It Ic spf-delay Ar seconds
Set SPF delay in seconds.
The delay between receiving an update to the link
state database and starting the shortest path first calculation.
The default value is 1; valid range is 1\-10 seconds.
.Pp
.It Ic spf-holdtime Ar seconds
Set the SPF holdtime in seconds.
The minimum time between two consecutive
shortest path first calculations.
The default value is 5 seconds; the valid range is 1\-5 seconds.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic stub Ic router
.Pq Ic yes Ns \&| Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic yes ,
all interfaces with active neighbors will have a metric of infinity.
This ensures that the other routers prefer routes around this router while
still being able to reach directly connected IP prefixes.
The
.Ic stub Ic router
option is automatically enabled if either the
.Xr sysctl 8
variable
.Va net.inet.ip.forwarding
is set to a value different to 1 or if the FIB is not coupled.
.El
.Sh AREAS
Areas are used for grouping interfaces.
All interface specific parameters can
be configured per area, overruling the global settings.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic area Ar address
Specify an area section, grouping one or more interfaces.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
area 0.0.0.0 {
	interface em0
	interface em1 {
		metric 10
	}
}
.Ed
.El
.Pp
Area specific parameters are listed below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic demote Ar group Op Ar count
Increase the
.Xr carp 4
demotion counter by
.Ar count
on the given interface group, usually
.Ar carp ,
when no neighbor in the area is in an active state.
The demotion counter will be decreased when one neighbor in that
area is in an active state.
The default value for
.Ar count
is 1.
.Pp
For more information on interface groups,
see the
.Ic group
keyword in
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.El
.Sh INTERFACES
Each interface can have several parameters configured individually, otherwise
they are inherited.
An interface is specified by its name.
If multiple networks are configured an additional IP address can be supplied.
By default the first IP address is used.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
interface em0 {
	auth-type crypt
	auth-md 1 "yotVoo_Heypp"
	auth-md-keyid 1
}
interface fxp0:192.168.1.3
.Ed
.Pp
Interface specific parameters are listed below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic auth-key Ar key
Set the authentication key for
.Ic simple
authentication.
Up to 8 characters can be specified.
.It Ic auth-md Ar key-id key
Set the authentication
.Ar key-id
and
.Ar key
for
.Ic crypt
authentication.
The valid range for
.Ar key-id
is 0\-255.
Up to 16 characters can be specified for
.Ar key .
Multiple keys may be specified.
.It Ic auth-md-keyid Ar key-id
Configure the
.Ar key-id
to use for
.Ic crypt
authentication.
The valid range for
.Ar key-id
is 0\-255.
The default key-id is 1.
While key-id 0 is valid, it is unavailable on Cisco devices.
.It Xo
.Ic auth-type
.Po Ic none Ns \&| Ns
.Ic simple Ns \&| Ns Ic crypt Pc
.Xc
Set the authentication type.
The default is
.Ic none .
Simple authentication uses a plaintext password, up to 8 characters.
Crypt authentication uses an MD5 hash.
.It Ic demote Ar group
Increase the
.Xr carp 4
demotion counter by 1 on the given interface group, usually
.Ar carp ,
when the interface state is going down.
The demotion counter will be decreased when the interface
state is active again.
.It Ic hello-interval Ar seconds
Set the hello interval.
The default value is 10; valid range is 1\-65535 seconds.
.It Ic metric Ar cost
Set the interface metric a.k.a. cost.
The default value is 10; valid range is 1\-65535.
.It Ic passive
Prevent transmission and reception of OSPF packets on this interface.

inactive for router-dead-time its state is set to DOWN.
Neighbors
that have been inactive for more than 24 hours are completely removed.
.It Ic router-priority Ar priority

The default value is 1; valid range is 0\-255.
If set
to 0 the router is not eligible as a Designated Router or Backup Designated
Router.
