.Sh NAME
.Nm ospfd.conf
.Nd Open Shortest Path First daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr ospfd 8
daemon implements the Open Shortest Path First protocol version 2 as described
in RFC 2328.
.Sh SECTIONS
The
.Nm
config file is divided into three main sections.
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sy Macros
User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sy Global Configuration
Global settings for
.Xr ospfd 8 .
A number of global settings can be overruled in specific areas or interfaces.
.It Sy Areas
An OSPF router must be a member of at least one area.
Areas are used to group interfaces, simplifying configuration.
.El
.Sh MACROS
Much like
.Xr cpp 1
or
.Xr m4 1 ,
macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, and may contain letters, digits,
and underscores.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example,
.Ic area ,
.Ic interface ,
or
.Ic hello-interval ) .
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hi="5"
area 0.0.0.0 {
	interface em0 {
		hello-interval $hi
	}
}
.Ed
.Pp
The same can be accomplished by specifying the hello-interval
globally or within the area declaration.
.Sh GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
All interface related settings can be configured globally, per area and per
interface.
The only settings that can be set globally and not overruled are listed below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Ic fib-update
.Pq Ic yes Ns \&| Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic no ,
do not update the Forward Information Base, a.k.a. the kernel
routing table.
The default is
.Ic yes .
.It Ic router-id Ar address
Set the router ID; if not specified, the lowest IP address of the router
will be used.
.It Ic spf-delay Ar seconds
Set SPF delay in seconds.
The delay between receiving an update to the link
state database and starting the shortest path first calculation.
The default value is 1; valid range is 1\-10 seconds.
.Pp
.It Ic spf-holdtime Ar seconds
Set the SPF holdtime in seconds.
The minimum time between two consecutive
shortest path first calculations.
The default value is 5 seconds; the valid is range 1\-5 seconds.
.El
.Sh AREAS
Areas are used for grouping interfaces.
All interface specific parameters can
be configured per area, overruling the global settings.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic area Ar address
Specify an area section, grouping one or more interfaces.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
area 0.0.0.0 {
	interface em0 {
	}
	interface em1 {
	}
}
.Ed
.El
.Sh INTERFACES
Each interface can have several parameters configured individually, otherwise
they are inherited.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
interface em0 {
}
.Ed
.Pp
Interface specific parameters are listed below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic auth-key Ar key
Set the authentication key.
If the auth-type is set to simple, up to 8 characters can be specified.
.It Xo
.Ic auth-type
.Po Ic none Ns \&| Ns
.Ic simple Ns \&| Ns Ic crypt Pc
.Xc
Set the authentication type.
The default is none.
Simple authentication uses a plaintext password, up to 8 characters.
Crypt authentication uses an MD5 hash.
.It Ic hello-interval Ar seconds
Set the hello interval.
The default value is 10; valid range is 1\-65535 seconds.
.It Ic metric Ar cost
Set the interface metric a.k.a. cost.
The default value is 10; valid range is 1\-65535.
.It Ic passive
Prevent transmission and reception of OSPF packets on this interface.
.It Ic retransmit-interval Ar seconds
Set retransmit interval.
The default value is 5 seconds; valid range is 5\-3600 seconds.
.It Ic router-dead-time Ar seconds
Set the router dead time, a.k.a. neighbor inactivity timer.
The default value is 40 seconds; valid range is 2\-2147483647 seconds.
When a neighbor has been
inactive for router-dead-time its state is set to DOWN.
Neighbors
that have been inactive for more than 24 hours are completely removed.
.It Ic router-priority Ar seconds
Set the router priority.
The default value is 1; valid range is 0\-255.
If set
to 0 the router is not eligible as a Designated Router or Backup Designated
Router.
.It Ic transmit-delay Ar seconds
Set the transmit delay.
The default value is 1; valid range is 1\-3600 seconds.
