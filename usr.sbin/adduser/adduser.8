.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm adduser 
is a simple program for adding new users.
.Nm adduser
first performs consistency
checks on the passwd, group, and shell databases. It creates passwd/group
entries, a HOME directory, dotfiles for a new user, and sends him or her a
welcome message at the discretion of the person creating the account.
.Sh RESTRICTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy username
Login names should contain only lowercase characters or digits. They should be
no longer than 8 characters (see 
.Xr setlogin 2
BUGS section). 
.\" The reasons for this limit are "Historical". 
.\" Given that people have traditionally wanted to break this
.\" limit for aesthetic reasons, it's never been of great importance to break
.\" such a basic fundamental parameter in UNIX.
.\" You can change UT_NAMESIZE in /usr/include/utmp.h and recompile the
.\" world; people have done this and it works, but you will have problems
.\" with any precompiled programs, or source that assumes the 8-character
.\" name limit and NIS. The NIS protocol mandates an 8-character username.
If you need a longer login name for e-mail addresses,
you can define an alias in
.Pa /etc/aliases .
.It Sy fullname
This should contain the user's firstname and surname.  The 
.Dq \&:
is not permitted.
.It Sy shell
Only valid entries from the 
.Xr shells 5
database or entries corresponding to
.Xr sliplogin 8
and
.Xr pppd 8
are permitted.
.It Sy uid_start
This value is the start of the range where free UID values are
searched for.  This value must be less than the value of uid_end.
The default value is 1000 or as configured in the configuration file.
.It Sy uid_end
This value is the end of the range where free UID values are
searched for.  This value must be more than the value of uid_start.
The default value is 32000 or as configured in the configuration file.
.It Sy gid/login group
This value is generated automatically, but can be specified at the
discretion of the person invoking the program. 
.It Sy password
If not empty, the password is encrypted according to 
.Xr passwd.conf 5 .
If empty, the account will be automatically disabled to prevent spurious
access to it.
.El
.\" .Sh UNIQUE GROUP
.\" Perhaps you're missing what *can* be done with this scheme that falls apart
.\" with most other schemes.  With each user in his/her own group the user can
.\" safely run with a umask of 002 and have files created in their home directory
.\" and not worry about others being able to read them.
.\" 
.\" For a shared area you create a separate uid/gid (like cvs or ncvs on freefall),
.\" you place each person that should be able to access this area into that new
.\" group.
.\" 
.\" This model of uid/gid administration allows far greater flexibility than lumping
.\" users into groups and having to muck with the umask when working in a shared
.\" area.
.\" 
.\" I have been using this model for almost 10 years and found that it works
.\" for most situations, and has never gotten in the way.  (Rod Grimes)
.Sh CONFIGURATION
.Nm adduser
follows these steps to extract its configuration
information:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Sy 1.
Read internal variables.
.It Sy 2.
Read configuration file
.Po Ns Pa /etc/adduser.conf
.Pc .
.It Sy 3.
Parse command-line options.
.El
.Pp
The adduser.conf format is explained within that file and is quite
straightforward.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy -batch username [group[,group]...] [fullname] [password]
Enter batch mode in which multiple users are specified on the command-line
in a compact format.
.It Sy -check_only
Check the passwd, group, and shells databases for consistency and problems
then exit without performing any other operation.
.It Sy -create_config
Create or edit default configuration information and message file before 
proceeding with the normal interactive adduser procedure.
.It Sy -dotdir Ar directory
Copy files from 
.Ar directory 
into the HOME directory of new users.  Files named in the fashion of
.Dq Pa dot.foo
will be renamed to 
.Dq Pa .foo .
By default, all files are made writable and readable by 
their owner.
.\" don't allow group or world to write files and allow only owner
.\" to read/execute/write .rhost, .Xauthority, .kermrc, .netrc, Mail,
.\" prv, iscreen, term.
.It Sy -encrypt,-e Ar method
Encrypt local passwords using
.Ar method
of encryption as described in 
.Xr passwd.conf 5 .
.It Sy -group Ar login_group
Specify the default login group.  A value of 
.Ar USER
means that the username is to be used as the login group.
.It Sy -help,-h,-?
Print a summary of options and exit.
.It Sy -home Ar partition
Specify the default home partition where all users' home directories
are to be located.
.It Sy -message Ar file
Send new users a welcome message from
.Ar file .
Specifying a value of
.Dq no
for
.Ar file
causes no message to be sent to new users.
.It Sy -noconfig
Do not read the default configuration file.
.It Sy -shell Ar shell 
Specify the default shell for new users.
.It Sy -silent,-s,-quiet,-q
Causes the program to print fewer warnings, questions, and bug reports. 
.It Sy -uid Ar uid
Use UIDs from 
.Ar uid
up when automatically generating UIDs.
.It Sy -verbose,-v
Causes the program to print many warnings and questions.
This option is recommended for novice users.
