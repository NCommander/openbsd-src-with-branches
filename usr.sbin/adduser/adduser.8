.Sh NAME
.Nm adduser
.Nd command for adding new users

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm adduser
    [-batch username [group[,group]...] [fullname] [password]]
    [-check_only] [-config_create] [-dotdir dotdir] 
    [-group login_group] [-h|-help] [-home home] 
    [-message message_file] [-noconfig] [-shell shell] 
    [-s|-silent|-q|-quit] [-uid uid_start] [-v|-verbose]


.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Adduser 
is a simple program for adding new users. Adduser checks
passwd, group and shell database. It creates passwd/group entry,
HOME-directory, dotfiles and sends new user a welcome message.

.Sh RESTRICTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Sy username
Login name. Only lowercase characters or digits. Maximum length
is 8 characters (see 
.Xr setlogin 2
BUGS section). 
.\" The reasons for this limit are "Historical". 
.\" Given that people have traditionally wanted to break this
.\" limit for aesthetic reasons, it's never been of great importance to break
.\" such a basic fundamental parameter in UNIX.
.\" You can change UT_NAMESIZE in /usr/include/utmp.h and recompile the
.\" world; people have done this and it works, but you will have problems
.\" with any precompiled programs, or source that assumes the 8-character
.\" name limit and NIS. The NIS protocol mandates an 8-character username.
If you need a longer login name for e-mail addresses,
you can define an alias in
.Pa /etc/aliases .
.It Sy fullname
Firstname and surname. 
.Ql Pa \:
not allowed.
.It Sy shell
Only valid shells from shell database or sliplogin and pppd
.It Sy uid
Automatically generated or your choice, less than 32000.
.It Sy gid/login group
Your choice or automatically generated. 
.It Sy password
If not empty, password is encoded with crypt.
.El

.\" .Sh UNIQUE GROUP
.\" Perhaps you're missing what *can* be done with this scheme that falls apart
.\" with most other schemes.  With each user in his/her own group the user can
.\" safely run with a umask of 002 and have files created in their home directory
.\" and not worry about others being able to read them.
.\" 
.\" For a shared area you create a separate uid/gid (like cvs or ncvs on freefall),
.\" you place each person that should be able to access this area into that new
.\" group.
.\" 
.\" This model of uid/gid administration allows far greater flexibility than lumping
.\" users into groups and having to muck with the umask when working in a shared
.\" area.
.\" 
.\" I have been using this model for almost 10 years and found that it works
.\" for most situations, and has never gotten in the way.  (Rod Grimes)
