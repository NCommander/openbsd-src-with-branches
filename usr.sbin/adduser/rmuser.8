.Dt RMUSER 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rmuser
.Nd remove users from the system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rmuser
.Op Ar username
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility removes a user's
.Xr crontab 1
entry (if any) and any
.Xr at 1
jobs belonging to the user,
then removes a user from the system's local password file, removes
the user's home directory if it is owned by the user, and removes
the user's incoming mail file if it exists.  The username is removed
from any groups to which it belongs in the file
.Pa /etc/group .
If a group becomes empty and the group name is the same as the username,
the group is removed (this complements
.Xr adduser 8 Ns 's
per-user unique groups).
.Pp
.Nm
politely refuses to remove users whose uid is 0 (typically root), since
it seemed like a good idea at the time
.Nm
was written.
.Pp
.Nm
shows the selected user's password file entry and asks for confirmation
that you wish to remove the user.  If the user's home directory is owned
by the user (and not by any other user),
.Nm
asks whether you wish to remove the user's home directory and everything
below.
.Pp
Available options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width username
.It Ar \&username
Identifies the user to be removed; if not present,
.Nm
interactively asks for the user to be removed.
