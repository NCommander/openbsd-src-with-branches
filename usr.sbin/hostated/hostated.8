.Sh NAME
.Nm hostated
.Nd Host Status daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dnv
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the host status daemon for server load balancing.
Its main purpose is to maintain pf tables up to date
as well as related pf rdr rules.
To communicate with
.Xr pf 4
.Nm
uses the anchor facility. To enable
.Nm
to install rulesets through the anchor you will
need the following line in the NAT section of your
.Xr pf.conf 5 
configuration file:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
rdr-anchor "hostated/*"
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
manipulates three data types: services, tables and hosts.
Each service represents a
.Xr pf 4
rdr rule. A service contains at least one table and one virtual ip which
are used to create the proper rule.
Each table contains at least one host, and is mapped to a
.Xr pf 4
table. Additionnaly, a table can be backed up i.e its content will be swapped
by the content of another table when it is empty. This can be used to serve
static content when a dynamic service goes down.
See
.Xr hostated.conf 5
for a more detailed explanation of how to configure
.Nm
.
.Pp
.Xr hostatectl 8
can be used to enable or disable hosts, tables and services as well
as showing the current status of each object.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds

If this options is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to
