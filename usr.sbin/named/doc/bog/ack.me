.b "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \(em 4.9.3"
.pp
The \fI<bind-workers@vix.com>\fP mailing list was once again of great help;
this release would not be nearly as ready for prime time if not for their
efforts.  Special commendations are owed to Robert Elz, Don "Truck" Lewis,
Bob Halley, Mark Andrews, Berthold Paffrath, Ruediger Volk, and Peter Koch.
.pp
Digital Equipment Corporation, Hewlett Packard, Silicon Graphics, and SunSoft
all made hardware available for integration testing; this made the release
far more solid than it would otherwise have been.  More hardware loans are
welcome \(em if you are a system vendor and you would like \s-2BIND\s+2 to
run ``out of the box'' on your platform and are willing to lend some rusty
old hardware for the purpose, please contact me (\fI<paul@vix.org>\fP) to
make the arrangements.
.pp
Special thanks to the Internet Software Consortium for funding this work.
Contact \fI<isc-info@isc.org>\fP if your organization would like to
participate in funding future releases of \s-2BIND\s+2 and other freely
redistributable software packages that are in wide use on the Internet.

.b "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \(em through 4.9"
.pp
The alpha-test group was extremely helpful in furnishing improvements,
finding and repairing bugs, and being patient.  I would like to express
special thanks to Brian Reid of Digital Equipment corporation for funding
this work.  Robert Elz, Alan Barrett, Paul Albitz, Bryan Beecher, Andrew
Partan, Andy Cherenson, Tom Limoncelli, Berthold Paffrath, Fuat Baran, Anant
Kumar, Art Harkin, Win Treese, Don Lewis, Christophe Wolfhugel, and a cast
of dozens all helped out above and beyond the call of duty.  Special thanks
to Phil Almquist, who got the project started and contributed a lot of the
code and fixed several of the worst bugs.

.b "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \(em through 4.8.3"
.pp
Many thanks to the users at U. C. Berkeley for falling into many of the holes
involved with integrating BIND into the system so that others would be
spared the trauma.  I would also like to extend gratitude to Jim McGinness
and Digital Equipment Corporation for permitting me to spend most of my time
on this project.
.pp
Ralph Campbell, Doug Kingston, Craig Partridge, Smoot Carl-Mitchell, Mike
Muuss and everyone else on the DARPA Internet who has contributed to the
development of BIND.  To the members of the original BIND project, Douglas
Terry, Mark Painter, David Riggle and Songnian Zhou.
.pp
Anne Hughes, Jim Bloom and Kirk McKusick and the many others who have
reviewed this paper giving considerable advice.
