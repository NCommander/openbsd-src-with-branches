.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm hostated.conf
.Nd Host Status daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file for the Host Status Daemon,
.Xr hostated 8 .
.Sh SECTIONS
.Nm
is divided into four main sections:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sy Macros
User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sy Global Configuration
Global settings for
.Xr hostated 8 .
.It Sy Tables
Table definitions describe the content of a
.Xr pf 4
table and the method used for checking the health of the hosts
they contain.
.It Sy Services
Services will be translated to
.Xr pf 4
rdr rules if their table or backup table have content.
.El
.Sh MACROS
Macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, and may contain letters, digits,
and underscores.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example,
.Ic table ,
.Ic service ,
or
.Ic timeout ) .
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
www1="10.0.0.1"
www2="10.0.0.2"
table webhosts {
	check tcp
	timeout 300
	real port 80
	host $www1
	host $www2
}
.Ed
.Sh GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
Here are the settings that can be set globally:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic timeout Ar number
.Xc
Set the global timeout for checks.
This can be overriden by the timeout value in the table definitions
and is 200 milliseconds by default.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic interval Ar number
.Xc
Set the interval in seconds at which the hosts will be checked.
The default interval is 10 seconds.
.El
.Sh TABLES
Tables are used to group a set of hosts that can be checked using the same
method.
Only one health-checking method can be used per table.
Table specific configuration directives are described below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic check http Ar path Ic code Ar number
For each host in the table, verify that retrieving the URL
.Ar path
gives the HTTP return code
.Ar number .
.It Ic check http Ar path Ic digest Ar string
For each host in the table, verify that retrieving the URL
.Ar path
produces a content whose SHA1 digest is
.Ar digest .
The digest does not take the HTTP headers into account.
To compute the digest, use this simple command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ftp -o - http://host[:port]/path | sha1
.Ed
.Pp
This gives a digest
that can be used as is in a digest statement:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
a9993e36476816aba3e25717850c26c9cd0d89d
.Ed
.It Ic check icmp
Ping hosts in this table to determine whether they are up or not.
This method will automatically use ICMP or ICMPV6 depending on the
address family of each host.
.It Ic check tcp
Use a simple TCP connect to check that hosts are up.
.It Ic disable
Start the table disabled \(en no hosts will be checked in this table.
The table can be later enabled through
.Xr hostatectl 8 .
.It Ic host Ar address
Add the host whose address is
.Ar address
to the list of hosts to be checked in this table.
Each table needs at least one host.
.It Ic real port Ar number
When using the TCP or HTTP checking methods, use this port to connect
to hosts.
This parameter is mandatory.
Main and backup tables need to have the same real port.
.It Ic timeout Ar number
Set the timeout in milliseconds for each host that is checked using
TCP as the transport.
This will override the global timeout, which is 200 milliseconds by default.
.El
.Sh SERVICES
Services represent a
.Xr pf 4
rdr rule.
They are used to specify which addresses will be redirected
to the hosts in the specified tables.
The configuration directives that are valid in this context are described
below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic backup table Ar name
Specify the table to switch to when all hosts in the main table
are seen as down or disabled.
.It Ic disable
Set the service initially disabled.
It can be later enabled through
.Xr hostatectl 8 .
.It Ic table Ar name
Specify the main table to be used.
This is mandatory.
.It Ic tag Ar name
Automatically tag packets passing through the
.Xr pf 4
rdr rule with the name supplied.
This allows simpler filter rules.
.It Ic virtual ip Ar address Ic port Ar number
Specify an address and a port that will be used to redirect requests
to the hosts in the main or backup table.
Optionally an interface name can be given as follows,
to specify which interface the rdr rule will be enabled on:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
interface ``ifname''
.Ed
.El
.Sh EXAMPLE
This configuration file would create a service
.Dq www
which load balances four hosts
and falls back to one host containing a
.Dq sorry page :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
##
##
www1=front-www1.private.example.com
www2=front-www2.private.example.com
www3=front-www3.private.example.com
www4=front-www4.private.example.com
