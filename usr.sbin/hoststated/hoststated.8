.Sh NAME
.Nm hoststated
.Nd Host Status daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dnv
.Oo Xo
.Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value Oc
.Xc
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the host status daemon for server load balancing.
Its main purpose is to keep
.Xr pf 4
tables up to date
as well as any related pf rdr rules.
To communicate with pf,
.Nm
uses the anchor facility.
To enable
.Nm
to install rulesets through the anchor,
the following line is required in the NAT section of
.Xr pf.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
rdr-anchor "hoststated/*"
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
manipulates three data types: services, tables, and hosts.
Each service represents a
.Xr pf 4
rdr rule.
A service contains at least one table and one virtual IP which are
used to create the proper rule.
Each table contains at least one host, and is mapped to a pf table.
Additionally a table can be backed up i.e. its content will be swapped
by the content of another table when it is empty.
This can be used to serve static content when a dynamic service goes down.
See
.Xr hoststated.conf 5
for a more detailed explanation of how to configure
.Nm .
.Pp
.Xr hoststatectl 8
can be used to enable or disable hosts, tables, and services as well
as showing the current status of each object.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value

.It Fl d

.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl f Ar file
