.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Op Fl anv
.Op Ar driver ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility installs or updates firmware packages from the Internet.
Since firmware with acceptable licenses are already present in
.Ox ,
.Nm
exists purely to install and update firmware that may not be freely
distributed with
.Ox .
.Pp
If no
.Ar driver
is specified, the
.Nm
utility tries to determine which firmware are needed on the system.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Install or update all available firmware.
It is an error to specify this option with any
.Ar driver
arguments.
.It Fl n
Pass the
.Fl n
flag to
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
causing it to not actually install or update any firmware packages,
just report the steps that would be taken if it did.
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output and pass the
.Fl v
flag to
.Xr pkg_add 1 .
This flag can be specified multiple times for increased
.Xr pkg_add 1
