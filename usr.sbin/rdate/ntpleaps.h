/* Leap second support for SNTP clients
 * This header file and its corresponding C file provide generic
 * ability for NTP or SNTP clients to correctly handle leap seconds
 * by reading them from an always existing file and subtracting the
 * leap seconds from the NTP return value before setting the posix
 * clock. This is fairly portable between operating systems and may
 * be used for patching other ntp clients, too. The tzfile used is:
 * /usr/share/zoneinfo/right/UTC which is available on any unix-like
 * platform with the Olson tz library, which is necessary to get real
 * leap second zoneinfo files and userland support anyways.
