# Address ranges can be specified for each subnet attached to
# a shared network.   Since these subnets share the same physical
# network, addresses are pooled together, and assignments are made
# without regard to the actual subnet.   If the optional dynamic-bootp
# keyword is given in the address range declaration, then addresses
# in that range can be assigned either with the DHCP protocol or the
# BOOTP protocol; otherwise, only DHCP clients will have addresses
# allocated from the address range.
#
# Note that each IP subnet can have its own options specific to that subnet.
# options that aren't specified in the subnet are taken from the shared
# network (if any) and then from the global option list.

# Hosts can have fixed addresses on some networks, but receive dynamically

# declaration for that client must be given which does not have a fixed
# address.   If a client should get different parameters depending on
# what subnet it boots on, host declarations for each such network should
# be given.   Finally, if a domain name is given for a host's fixed address
# and that domain name evaluates to more than one address, the address
# corresponding to the network to which the client is attached, if any,
# will be assigned.
