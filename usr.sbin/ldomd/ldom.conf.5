.Sh NAME
.Nm ldom.conf
.Nd Logical Domain configuration
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file to configure logical domains.
.Pp
Domains are defined in following format:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic domain Ar name Brq ...
Declares a scope for resources assigned to the specified domain.
The scope must be opened and closed with curly braces and contains
one or more of the following keywords, each on a separate line.
A scope with
.Ar name
"primary" configures resources for the primary domain.
If no configuration for the primary domain exists it is assigned
all CPU and memory resources not used by any guest domains.
.It Ic vcpu Ar number
Declares the number of virtual CPUs assigned to a domain.
.It Ic memory Ar number Ns Op Ar unit
Declares the amount of memory assigned to a domain, in bytes.
Optionally, the units 'K', 'M', or 'G', for kilo-, mega-, and gigabytes
can be used.
.It Ic variable Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value
Sets the specified NVRAM variable for the domain.
.It Ic vdisk Ar file
The specified file is used to back a virtual disk of the guest
domain.
.Ar file
can be a block device node or a disk image file created with
.Xr dd 1 .
This keyword can be used multiple times.
.It Ic vnet Op Brq Ar keyword Ns = Ns Ar value ...
Assign a
.Xr vnet 4
network interface to the guest domain.
This keyword can be used multiple times.
The curly braces are optional and can contain the following keywords:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic mac-addr Ar address
Configures the MAC address of the interface.
.It Ic mtu Ar number
Configures the MTU of the interface.
.El
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Define a domain with 12 virtual cores, 1GB memory, two file based virtual disks
and one virtual network interface:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
domain "puffy" {
	vcpu 12
	memory 4G
	vdisk "/home/puffy/vdisk0"
	vdisk "/home/puffy/vdisk1"
	vnet
}
.Ed
.Pp
Define another one with slightly less resources:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
domain "salmah" {
	vcpu 8
	memory 2G
	vdisk "/home/salmah/vdisk0"
	vdisk "/home/salmah/vdisk1"
	vnet
}
.Ed
.Pp
On a machine with 32 cores and 64GB physical memory, this leaves 12 cores and
58GB memory to the primary domain.
