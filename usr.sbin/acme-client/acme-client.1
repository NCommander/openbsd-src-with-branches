.Sh NAME
.Nm acme-client
.Nd ACME client
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm acme-client
.Op Fl bFNnrv
.Op Fl f Ar configfile
.Ar domain
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is an
Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) client.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Back up all certificates in the certificate directory.
This only happens if a remove or replace operation is possible.
The backups are named
.Pa cert-NNNNN.pem ,
.Pa chain-NNNNN.pem ,
and
.Pa fullchain-NNNNN.pem ,
where
.Li NNNNN
is the current
.Ux
Epoch.
Any given backup uses the same Epoch time for all three certificates.
If there are no certificates in place, this option does nothing.
.It Fl F
Force updating the certificate signature even if it's too soon.
.It Fl f Ar configfile
Specify an alternative configuration file.
.It Fl D
Create a new RSA domain key if one does not already exist.
.It Fl A
Create a new RSA account key if one does not already exist.
.It Fl r
Revoke the X509 certificate found in the certificates.
.It Fl v
Verbose operation.
Specify twice to also trace communication and data transfers.
.It Ar domain
The domain name.
.El
.Pp
Public certificates are by default placed in
.Pa /etc/ssl/acme
as
.Pa cert.pem Pq the domain certificate ,
.Pa chain.pem ,
and
.Pa fullchain.pem ,
respectively.
.Pa cert.pem
is checked for its expiration: if more than 30 days from expiry,
.Nm
does not attempt to refresh the signature.
.Pp
Challenges are used to verify that the submitter has access to
the registered domains.
.Nm
only implements the
.Dq http-01
challenge type, where a file is created within a directory accessible by
a locally-run web server.
The default challenge directory
.Pa /var/www/acme
can be served by
.Xr httpd 8
with this location block,
which will properly map response challenges:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
location "/.well-known/acme-challenge/*" {
	root "/acme"
	root strip 2
}
.Ed
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/ssl/acme/private/privkey.pem" -compact
.It Pa /etc/acme/privkey.pem
Default accountkey.
.It Pa /etc/ssl/acme
Default certdir.
.It Pa /etc/ssl/acme/private/privkey.pem
Default domainkey.
.It Pa /var/www/acme
Default challengedir.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
returns 1 on failure, 2 if the certificates didn't change (up to date),
or 0 if certificates were changed (revoked or updated).
.Sh EXAMPLES
To create and submit a new key for a single domain, assuming that the
web server has already been configured to map the challenge directory
as in the
.Sx Challenges
section:
.Pp
.Dl # acme-client -vNn www.foo.com
.Pp
A daily
.Xr cron 8
job can renew the certificates:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#! /bin/sh

acme-client www.foo.com

if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
	/etc/rc.d/httpd reload
fi

The

utility was written by
.An Kristaps Dzonsons Aq Mt kristaps@bsd.lv .
.Sh BUGS
The challenge and certificate processes currently retain their (root)
privileges.
.Pp
For the time being,
.Nm
only supports RSA as an account key format.
