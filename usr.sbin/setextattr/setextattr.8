.Sh NAME
.Nm setextattr
.Nd set a named extended attribute
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar attrnamespace
.Ar attrname
.Ar filename
.Ar attrvalue
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a user tool to set a named extended attribute on a file or directory to
the provided string.
The
.Ar attrnamespace
argument should be the namespace of the attribute to retrieve: legal
values are "user" and "system".
The
.Ar attrname
argument should be the name of the attribute,
.Ar filename
the name of the file or directory to set the attribute for, and
.Ar attrvalue
a string to store in the attribute.
.Nm
will store the string in the file's attribute.
In order for
.Nm
to succeed, the attribute service must be available on the file system,
and appropriate privilege may be required.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl # setextattr system md5 /bsd `md5 < /bsd`
.Pp
Set the
.Dq md5
extended attribute on the file /bsd to the string
containing the output of
.Dq md5 < /bsd .

.Sh HISTORY
