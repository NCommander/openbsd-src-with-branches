.Nd format floppy disks
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm fdformat
.Bq Fl q
.Bq Fl v
.Bq Fl n
.Bq Fl c Ar cyls
.Bq Fl s Ar secs
.Bq Fl h Ar heads
.Bq Fl r Ar rate
.Bq Fl g Ar gap3len

.Bq Fl F Ar fillbyte
.Bq Fl t Ar steps_per_track
.Ar device_name
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm fdformat
formats a floppy disk at device
.Ar device_name .
.Ar device_name
should be a character device; it may be given either with a full path
name of a raw device node for a floppy disk drive
.Pq e.g., Pa /dev/rfd0c ,
or default name in an abbreviated form,
.Pq e.g., Em fd0 .
Note that any geometry constraints of the device node
.Pq minor device number
are meaningless, since they're overridden by
.Nm fdformat .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 10n -offset indent
.It Fl q
Suppress any normal output from the command, and don't ask the
user for a confirmation whether to format the floppy disk at
.Ar device_name .
.It Fl n
Don't verify floppy after formatting.
.It Fl v
Don't format, verify only.
.It Fl c Ar cyls
.It Fl s Ar secs
.It Fl h Ar heads
.It Fl r Ar rate
.It Fl g Ar gap3len
.It Fl i Ar intleave
.It Fl S Ar secshft
.It Fl F Ar fillbyte
.It Fl t Ar steps_per_track
An alternate method to specify the geometry data to write to the floppy disk.
.El

If the
.Fl q
flag has not been specified, the user is asked for a confirmation
of the intended formatting process. In order to continue, an answer
of
.Dq y
must be given.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Unless
.Fl q
has been specified, a single letter is printed to standard output
to inform the user about the progress of work.
First, an
.Dq F
is printed when the track(s) is being formatted, then a
.Dq V
while it's being verified, and if an error has been detected, it
will finally change to
.Dq E .
.Pp
An exit status of 0 is returned upon successful operation. Exit status
1 is returned on any errors during floppy formatting, and an exit status
of 2 reflects invalid arguments given to the program (along with
appropriate information written to diagnostic output).

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm fdformat
was developed for 386BSD 0.1 and upgraded to the new
.Xr fd 4
floppy disk driver. It later became part of
FreeBSD 1.1, and was then ported to
.Ox 1.2 .
.Sh AUTHOR
The program was been contributed by Joerg Wunsch, Dresden,
with changes by Serge Vakulenko and Andrew A. Chernov, Moscow.
