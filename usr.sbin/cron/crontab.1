.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the program used to install, deinstall, or list the tables
used to drive the
.Xr cron 8
daemon in Vixie Cron. Each user can have their own
.Xr crontab 5 ,
and though these are files in
.Pa /var/cron/tabs ,
they are not intended to be edited directly.
.Pp
If the
.Pa /var/cron/allow
file exists, then you must be listed therein in order to use
.Nm crontab .
If the
.Pa /var/cron/allow
file does not exist but the
.Pa /var/cron/deny
file does exist, then you must
.Em not
be listed in the
.Pa /var/cron/deny
file in order to use
.Nm crontab .
If neither of these files exists, then
depending on site-dependent configuration parameters, only the super user
will be allowed to use
.Nm crontab ,
or all users will be able to use it.
.Pp
If the
.Fl u
option is given,
.Ar user
specifies the name of the user whose
.Xr crontab 5
is to be
tweaked. If this option is not given,
.Nm
examines
.Dq your
.Xr crontab 5 ;
i.e., the
crontab of the person executing the command.
Note that
.Xr su 8
can confuse
.Nm
and that if you are running inside of
.Xr su 8
you should always use the
.Fl u
option for safety's sake.
.Pp
The first form of this command is used to install a new crontab from some
named file, or standard input if the pseudo-filename
.Sq Fl
is given.
.Pp
The
.Fl l
option causes the current crontab to be displayed on standard output.
.Pp
The
.Fl r
option causes the current crontab to be removed.
.Pp
The
.Fl e
option is used to edit the current crontab using the editor specified by
the
.Ev VISUAL
or
.Ev EDITOR
environment variables. After you exit
from the editor, the modified
.Xr crontab 5
will be installed automatically.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.2-92
specification.
This new command syntax
differs from previous versions of Vixie Cron, as well as from the classic
SVR3 syntax.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
A fairly informative usage message appears if you run it with a bad command
line.
