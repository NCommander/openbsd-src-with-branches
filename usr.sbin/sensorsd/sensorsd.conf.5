.Sh NAME
.Nm sensorsd.conf
.Nd configuration file for sensorsd
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm sensorsd.conf
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file is read by
.Xr sensorsd 8
to configure hardware sensor monitoring.
Each entry represents one sensor and may specify high and low limits.
If the limits are crossed,
.Xr sensorsd 8 's
alert functionality is triggered and a command, if specified, is
executed.
.Pp
.Nm
follows the syntax of configuration databases as documented in
.Xr getcap 3 .
The following attributes may be used:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "commandXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Li command
Specify a command to be executed if limits are crossed.
.It Li high
Specify an upper limit.
.It Li low
Specify a lower limit.
.El
.Pp
The values for temperature sensors can be given in degrees Celsius or
Fahrenheit, for voltage sensors in volts, and fan speed sensors take a
unit-less number representing RPM.
.Pp
Sensors that provide status (such as from
.Xr bio 4 ,
.Xr esm 4 ,
or
.Xr ipmi 4 )
do not require boundary values specified (that otherwise will be
ignored) and simply trigger on status transitions.
.Pp
The command is executed on transitions out of, and back into, given limits.
Tokens in the command are substituted as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It %x
the xname of the device the sensor sits on
.It %t
the type of sensor
.It %n
the sensor number
.It %2
the sensor's current value
.It %3
the sensor's low limit
.It %4
the sensor's high limit
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/sensorsd.conf"
.It /etc/sensorsd.conf
Configuration file for
.Xr sensorsd 8 .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
In the following configuration file,
if hw.sensors.ipmi0.temp0 goes above 80C, the command
.Pa /etc/sensorsd/log_warning
will be executed,
with the sensor type, number and current value passed to it.
Alerts will be sent if hw.sensors.ipmi0.temp1 goes above 170F;
if hw.sensors.lm0.volt3 goes below 4.8V or above 5.2V;
if the speed of the fan attached to hw.sensors.lm0.fan1
goes below 1000RPM or above 8000RPM;
or if hw.sensors.ami0.drive0,
attached to raid volume sd0,
goes into a state other than
.Dq OK ,
such as drive failure, rebuild, or a complete failure.
