.Sh NAME
.Nm sensorsd.conf
.Nd configuration file for
.Xr sensorsd 8
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm sensorsd.conf
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file is read by
.Xr sensorsd 8
to configure hardware sensor monitoring.
Each entry represents one sensor and may specify high and low limits.
If the limits are crossed,
.Xr sensorsd 8 's
alert functionality is triggered and a command, if specified, is
executed.
.Pp
.Nm
follows the syntax of configuration databases as documented in
.Xr getcap 3 .
.Pp
Example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hw.sensors.0:high=80C:command=/etc/sensorsd/log_warning %1 %2
hw.sensors.1:high=170F
hw.sensors.2:low=4.8V:high=5.2V
hw.sensors.3:low=1000:high=8000
.Ed
.Pp
The values for temperature sensors can be given in degrees Celsius or
Fahrenheit, for voltage sensors in volts, and fan speed sensors take a
unit-less number representing RPM.
.Pp
The command is executed on transitions out of, and back into, given limits.
Tokens in the command are substituted as follows: %1 with
the sensor number, %2 with the sensor's current value, %3 with the
sensor's low limit, and %4 with the sensor's high limit.
