.Dt NETID 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm netid

.Nm YP
network credential file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Files in
.Xr netid 5
format are rare.
One lives in the
.Nm YP
map
.Dq netid.byname .
The format is rather simple.
Each row consists of two items: a key and a value.
When created by
.Xr mknetid 8
there are three types of records.
.Pp
The first type is information about which GIDs a UID has:
.Bd -literal
unix.<uid>@<yp-domain> <uid>:<gid>,<gid>
.Ed
.Pp
The second type contains information about hosts:
.Bd -literal
unix.<hostname>@<yp-domain> 0:<hostname>
.Ed
.Pp
The third type refers to records from a
.Xr netid 5
file other than the two types above.
.Sh EXAMPLES
A configuration file might look like the following:
.Bd -literal
unix.10714@kaka 10714:400,10
unix.jodie@kaka 0:jodie
.Ed
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/netid -compact
.It Pa /etc/netid
for lines not generated automatically by
.Xr mknetid 8 .
