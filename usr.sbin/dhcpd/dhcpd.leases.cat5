     ddhhccppdd..lleeaasseess - DHCP client lease database

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The Internet Software Consortium DHCP Server keeps a persistent database
     of leases that it has assigned.  This database is a free-form ASCII file
     containing a series of lease declarations.  Every time a lease is ac-
     quired, renewed or released, its new value is recorded at the end of the
     lease file.  So if more than one declaration appears for a given lease,
     the last one in the file is the current one.

     When dhcpd(8) is first installed, there is no lease database.  However,
     dhcpd requires that a lease database be present before it will start.  To
     make the initial lease database, just create an empty file called
     _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_d_h_c_p_d_._l_e_a_s_e_s.

     In order to prevent the lease database from growing without bound, the
     file is rewritten from time to time.  First, a temporary lease database
     is created and all known leases are dumped to it.  Then, the old lease
     database is renamed _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_d_h_c_p_d_._l_e_a_s_e_s_~.  Finally, the newly written
     lease database is moved into place.

     There is a window of vulnerability where if the dhcpd process is killed
     or the system crashes after the old lease database has been renamed but
     before the new one has been moved into place, there will be no
     _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_d_h_c_p_d_._l_e_a_s_e_s.  In this case, dhcpd will refuse to start, and will
     require manual intervention.  _D_O _N_O_T simply create a new lease file when
     this happens - if you do, you will lose all your old bindings, and chaos
     will ensue.  Instead, rename _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_d_h_c_p_d_._l_e_a_s_e_s_~ to
     _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_d_h_c_p_d_._l_e_a_s_e_s, restoring the old, valid lease file, and then start
     dhcpd.  This guarantees that a valid lease file will be restored.

     Lease descriptions are stored in a format that is parsed by the same re-
     cursive descent parser used to read the dhcpd.conf(5) and
     dhclient.conf(5) files.  Currently, the only declaration that is used in
     the ddhhccppdd..lleeaasseess file is the lleeaassee declaration.

          lleeaassee _i_p_-_a_d_d_r_e_s_s { _s_t_a_t_e_m_e_n_t_s_._._. }

     Each lease declaration includes the single IP address that has been
     leased to the client.  The statements within the braces define the dura-
     tion of the lease and to whom it is assigned.

     The start and end time of a lease are recorded using the ``starts'' and
     ``ends'' statements:

           ssttaarrttss _d_a_t_e;
           eennddss _d_a_t_e;

     Dates are specified as follows:

          _w_e_e_k_d_a_y _y_e_a_r/_m_o_n_t_h/_d_a_y _h_o_u_r:_m_i_n_u_t_e:_s_e_c_o_n_d

     The weekday is present to make it easy for a human to tell when a lease
     expires - it's specified as a number from zero to six, with zero being
     Sunday.  The day of week is ignored on input.  The year is specified with
     the century, so it should generally be four digits except for really long
     leases.  The month is specified as a number starting with 1 for January.
     The day of the month is likewise specified starting with 1.  The hour is
     a number from 0 to 23, the minute a number from 0 to 59, and the second
     also a number from 0 to 59.

     Lease times are specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), not in the
     local time zone.  "date -u" will show the current time in UTC.

     The MAC address of the network interface that was used to acquire the
     lease is recorded with the hhaarrddwwaarree statement:

           hhaarrddwwaarree _h_a_r_d_w_a_r_e_-_t_y_p_e _m_a_c_-_a_d_d_r_e_s_s;

     The MAC address is specified as a series of hexadecimal octets, separated
     by colons.

     If the client uses a client identifier to acquire its address, the client
     identifier is recorded using the uuiidd statement:

           uuiidd _c_l_i_e_n_t_-_i_d_e_n_t_i_f_i_e_r;

     The client identifier is recorded as a series of hexadecimal octets, re-
     gardless of whether the client specifies an ASCII string or uses the new-
     er hardware type/MAC address format.

     If the client sends a hostname using the CClliieenntt HHoossttnnaammee option, as spec-
     ified in some versions of the DHCP-DNS Interaction draft, that hostname
     is recorded using the cclliieenntt--hhoossttnnaammee statement.

           cclliieenntt--hhoossttnnaammee _"_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e_";

     If the client sends its hostname using the HHoossttnnaammee option, as Windows 95
     does, it is recorded using the hhoossttnnaammee statement.

           hhoossttnnaammee _"_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e_";

     The DHCP server may determine that a lease has been misused in some way,
     either because a client that has been assigned a lease NAKs it, or be-
     cause the server's own attempt to see if an address is in use prior to
     reusing it reveals that the address is in fact already in use.  In that
     case, the aabbaannddoonneedd statement will be used to indicate that the lease
     should not be reassigned.

           aabbaannddoonneedd;

     Abandoned leases are reclaimed automatically.  When a client asks for a
     new address, and the server finds that there are no new addresses, it
     checks to see if there are any abandoned leases, and allocates the least
     recently abandoned lease.  The standard mechanisms for checking for lease
     address conflicts are still followed, so if the abandoned lease's IP ad-
     dress is still in use, it will be reabandoned.

     If a client _r_e_q_u_e_s_t_s an abandoned address, the server assumes that the
     reason the address was abandoned was that the lease file was corrupted,
     and that the client is the machine that responded when the lease was
     probed, causing it to be abandoned.  In that case, the address is immedi-
     ately assigned to the client.
