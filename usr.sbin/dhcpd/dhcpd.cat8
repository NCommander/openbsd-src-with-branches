     The Internet Software Consortium DHCP Server, ddhhccppdd, implements the Dy-
     namic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and the Internet Bootstrap Pro-
     tocol (BOOTP).  DHCP allows hosts on a TCP/IP network to request and be
     assigned IP addresses, and also to discover information about the network
     to which they are attached.  BOOTP provides similar functionality, with
     certain restrictions.

OOPPEERRAATTIIOONN
     The DHCP protocol allows a host which is unknown to the network adminis-
     trator to be automatically assigned a new IP address out of a pool of IP
     addresses for its network.  In order for this to work, the network admin-
     istrator allocates address pools in each subnet and enters them into the
     dhcpd.conf(5) file.

     On startup, ddhhccppdd reads the _d_h_c_p_d_._c_o_n_f file and stores a list of avail-
     able addresses on each subnet in memory.  When a client requests an ad-
     dress using the DHCP protocol, ddhhccppdd allocates an address for it.  Each
     client is assigned a lease, which expires after an amount of time chosen
     by the administrator (by default, one day).  Before leases expire, the
     clients to which leases are assigned are expected to renew them in order
     to continue to use the addresses.  Once a lease has expired, the client
     to which that lease was assigned is no longer permitted to use the leased
     IP address.

     In order to keep track of leases across system reboots and server
     restarts, ddhhccppdd keeps a list of leases it has assigned in the
     dhcpd.leases(5) file.  Before ddhhccppdd grants a lease to a host, it records
     the lease in this file and makes sure that the contents of the file are
     flushed to disk.  This ensures that even in the event of a system crash,
     ddhhccppdd will not forget about a lease that it has assigned.  On startup,
     after reading the _d_h_c_p_d_._c_o_n_f file, ddhhccppdd reads the _d_h_c_p_d_._l_e_a_s_e_s file to
     refresh its memory about what leases have been assigned.

     New leases are appended to the end of the _d_h_c_p_d_._l_e_a_s_e_s file.  In order to
     prevent the file from becoming arbitrarily large, from time to time ddhhccppdd
     creates a new _d_h_c_p_d_._l_e_a_s_e_s file from its in-core lease database.  Once
     this file has been written to disk, the old file is renamed
     _d_h_c_p_d_._l_e_a_s_e_s_~, and the new file is renamed _d_h_c_p_d_._l_e_a_s_e_s.  If the system
     crashes in the middle of this process, whichever _d_h_c_p_d_._l_e_a_s_e_s file re-
     mains will contain all the lease information, so there is no need for a
     special crash recovery process.

     BOOTP support is also provided by this server.  Unlike DHCP, the BOOTP
     protocol does not provide a protocol for recovering dynamically-assigned
     addresses once they are no longer needed.  It is still possible to dynam-
     ically assign addresses to BOOTP clients, but some administrative process
     for reclaiming addresses is required.  By default, leases are granted to
     BOOTP clients in perpetuity, although the network administrator may set
     an earlier cutoff date or a shorter lease length for BOOTP leases if that
     makes sense.

     BOOTP clients may also be served in the old standard way, which is simply
     to provide a declaration in the _d_h_c_p_d_._c_o_n_f file for each BOOTP client,
     permanently assigning an address to each client.

     Whenever changes are made to the _d_h_c_p_d_._c_o_n_f file, ddhhccppdd must be restart-
     ed.  To restart ddhhccppdd, send a SIGTERM (signal 15) to the process ID con-
     tained in _/_v_a_r_/_r_u_n_/_d_h_c_p_d_._p_i_d, and then re-invoke ddhhccppdd.  Because the DHCP
     server database is not as lightweight as a BOOTP database, ddhhccppdd does not
     automatically restart itself when it sees a change to the _d_h_c_p_d_._c_o_n_f
     file.

     DHCP traffic always bypasses IPsec.  Otherwise there could be situations
     when a server has an IPsec SA for the client and sends replies over that,
     which a newly booted client would not be able to grasp.

CCOOMMMMAANNDD LLIINNEE
     The names of the network interfaces on which ddhhccppdd should listen for
     broadcasts may be specified on the command line.  This should be done on
     systems where ddhhccppdd is unable to identify non-broadcast interfaces, but
     should not be required on other systems.  If no interface names are spec-
     ified on the command line, ddhhccppdd will identify all network interfaces
     which are up, eliminating non-broadcast interfaces if possible, and lis-
     ten for DHCP broadcasts on each interface.

     If ddhhccppdd should listen on a port other than the standard (port 67), the
     --pp flag may used.  It should be followed by the UDP port number on which
     ddhhccppdd should listen.  This is mostly useful for debugging purposes.  If
     the --pp flag is specified, the server will transmit responses to clients
     at a port number that is one greater than the one specified - i.e., if
     you specify --pp 67, then the server will listen on port 67 and transmit to
     port 68.  Datagrams that must go through relay agents are sent to the
     port number specified with the --pp flag.  If you wish to use alternate
     port numbers, you must configure any relay agents you are using to use
     the same alternate port numbers.

     To run ddhhccppdd as a foreground process, rather than allowing it to run as a
     daemon in the background, the --ff flag should be specified.  This is use-
     ful when running ddhhccppdd under a debugger, or when running it out of init-
     tab on System V systems.

     To have ddhhccppdd log to _s_t_d_e_r_r, the --dd flag should be specified.  This can
     be useful for debugging, and also at sites where a complete log of all
     dhcp activity must be kept, but syslogd(8) is not reliable or otherwise
     cannot be used.  Normally, ddhhccppdd will log all output using the syslog(3)
     function with the log facility set to LOG_DAEMON.

     ddhhccppdd can be made to use an alternate configuration file with the --ccff
     flag, or an alternate lease file with the --llff flag.  Because of the im-
     portance of using the same lease database at all times when running ddhhccppdd
     in production, these options should be used _o_n_l_y for testing lease files
     or database files in a non-production environment.

     To avoid printing out the entire copyright message on start-up, the --qq
     flag should be specified.

     The syntax of the dhcpd.conf(5) file is discussed separately.  This sec-
     tion should be used as an overview of the configuration process, and the
     dhcpd.conf(5) documentation should be consulted for detailed reference
     information.

     Subnets
          ddhhccppdd needs to know the subnet numbers and netmasks of all subnets
          for which it will be providing service.  In addition, in order to
          dynamically allocate addresses, it must be assigned one or more
          ranges of addresses on each subnet which it can in turn assign to
          client hosts as they boot.  Thus, a very simple configuration pro-
          viding DHCP support might look like this:

                subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
                  range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.250;
                }

          Multiple address ranges may be specified like this:

                subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
                  range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.107;
                  range 239.252.197.113 239.252.197.250;
                }

          If a subnet will only be provided with BOOTP service and no dynamic
          address assignment, the range clause can be left out entirely, but
          the subnet statement must appear.

     Lease Lengths
          DHCP leases can be assigned almost any length from zero seconds to
          infinity.  What lease length makes sense for any given subnet, or
          for any given installation, will vary depending on the kinds of
          hosts being served.

          For example, in an office environment where systems are added from
          time to time and removed from time to time, but move relatively in-
          frequently, it might make sense to allow lease times of a month of
          more.  In a final test environment on a manufacturing floor, it may
          make more sense to assign a maximum lease length of 30 minutes -
          enough time to go through a simple test procedure on a network ap-
          pliance before packaging it up for delivery.

          It is possible to specify two lease lengths: the default length that
          will be assigned if a client doesn't ask for any particular lease
          length, and a maximum lease length.  These are specified as clauses
          to the subnet command:

                subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
                  range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.107;
                  default-lease-time 600;
                  max-lease-time 7200;
                }

          This particular subnet declaration specifies a default lease time of
          600 seconds (ten minutes), and a maximum lease time of 7200 seconds
          (two hours).  Other common values would be 86400 (one day), 604800
          (one week) and 2592000 (30 days).

          Each subnet need not have the same lease - in the case of an office
          environment and a manufacturing environment served by the same DHCP
          server, it might make sense to have widely disparate values for de-
          fault and maximum lease times on each subnet.

     BOOTP Support
          Each BOOTP client must be explicitly declared in the dhcpd.conf(5)
          file.  A very basic client declaration will specify the client net-
          work interface's hardware address and the IP address to assign to
          that client.  If the client needs to be able to load a boot file
          from the server, that file's name must be specified.  A simple BOOTP
          client declaration might look like this:

                host haagen {
                  hardware ethernet 08:00:2b:4c:59:23;
                  fixed-address 239.252.197.9;
                  filename "/tftpboot/haagen.boot";
                }

     Options
          DHCP (and also BOOTP with Vendor Extensions) provides a mechanism
          whereby the server can provide the client with information about how
          to configure its network interface (e.g., subnet mask), and also how
          the client can access various network services (e.g., DNS, IP
          routers, and so on).

          These options can be specified on a per-subnet basis, and, for BOOTP
          clients, also on a per-client basis.  In the event that a BOOTP
          client declaration specifies options that are also specified in its
          subnet declaration, the options specified in the client declaration
          take precedence.  A reasonably complete DHCP configuration might
          look something like this:

                subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
                  range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.250;
                  default-lease-time 600 max-lease-time 7200;
                  option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
                  option broadcast-address 239.252.197.255;
                  option routers 239.252.197.1;
                  option domain-name-servers 239.252.197.2, 239.252.197.3;
                  option domain-name "isc.org";
                }

          A BOOTP host on that subnet that needs to be in a different domain
          and use a different name server might be declared as follows:

                host haagen {
                  hardware ethernet 08:00:2b:4c:59:23;
                  fixed-address 239.252.197.9;
                  filename "/tftpboot/haagen.boot";
                  option domain-name-servers 192.5.5.1;
                  option domain-name "vix.com";
                }

     We realize that it would be nice if one could send a SIGHUP to the server
     and have it reload the database.  This is not technically impossible, but
     it would require a great deal of work, our resources are extremely limit-
     ed, and they can be better spent elsewhere.  So please don't complain
     about this on the mailing list unless you're prepared to fund a project
     to implement this feature, or prepared to do it yourself.
