.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm fw_update
.Nd install non-free firmware packages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl adinv
.Op Fl p Ar path
.Op Ar driver ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility installs, updates, or deletes firmware packages for
.Ar driver
from the Internet.
If no
.Ar driver
is specified, the
.Nm
utility tries to determine which firmware is needed on the system.
.Pp
Since firmware with an acceptable license is already present in
.Ox ,
.Nm
exists purely to deal with firmware that may not be freely
distributed with
.Ox .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Install or update firmware for all drivers.
It is an error to specify this option with any
.Ar driver
arguments.
.It Fl d
Delete firmware for
.Ar driver .
If used without parameters, delete all firmware that is not required by
a driver.
If used in conjunction with
.Fl a ,
delete firmware for all drivers.
.It Fl i
Display information about firmware which is installed or missing, and whether
it appears to be required by a driver.
.It Fl n
Dry run.
Do not actually install or update any firmware packages;
just report the steps that would be taken.
.It Fl p Ar path
Use the firmware found at package repository
.Ar path ,
being either a local directory or a URL,
instead of the default location.
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output.
This flag can be specified multiple times for increased verbosity.
.El
.Pp
Firmware is downloaded from release-specific directories at
.Lk http://firmware.openbsd.org/firmware/ .
The files are in the format required by
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
but direct use of pkg_add is discouraged.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
.Xr dmesg 8
