.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_sign
.Nd sign binary packages for distribution
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pkg_sign
.Bk -words
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl D Ar name Ns Op = Ns Ar value
.Op Fl j Ar maxjobs
.Op Fl o Ar dir
.Fl s Ar signify|x509
.Op Fl s Ar cert

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to sign existing collections of binary packages
created by
.Xr pkg_create 1 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D Ar resign
Allows signing over already signed packages.
Obviously, this checks the existing signature first,
so the
.Fl D Ar SIGNER
and
.Fl D Ar nosig
also apply with the same semantics as
.Xr pkg_add 1 .
.It Fl j Ar maxjobs
Sign existing packages in parallel.
.It Fl o Ar dir
Specify output directory for signing packages.
Otherwise, unsigned packages are created in the current directory.
.It Fl S Ar source
Source repository for packages to be signed.
This can be any url admissible for a
.Ev PKG_PATH ,
so that it is possible to sign packages during a transfer, e.g.,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pkg_sign -s signify -s mykey-pkg.sec \e
	-o output -S scp://build-machine/packages/
.Ed
.It Xo
.Fl s Ar signify|x509
.Op Fl s Ar cert
.Fl s Ar privkey
.Xc
Specify signature parameters for signed packages.
Option parameters are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ArsignifyDx509 -compact
.It Ar signify|x509
choose
.Xr signify 1
or X.509-style signatures.
.It Ar cert
the path to the signer's certificate (X.509 only)
.It Ar privkey
the path to the signer's private key.
For
.Xr signify ,
the private key name is used to set the
.Cm \@signer
annotation.
If a corresponding public key is found, the first signatures will be
checked for key mismatches.
.El
.Pp
For X.509, the signer's certificate and the signer's private key
should be generated using standard openssl x509 commands.
This assumes the existence of a certificate authority (or several), whose
public information is recorded as a
.Pa /etc/ssl/pkgca.pem
file.
.Pp
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output, display
.Sq Signed output/pkg.tgz
after each package is signed.
