.Dt PKG_DELETE 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_delete
.Nd delete software package distributions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pkg_delete
.Op Fl acIimnqsvXx
.Op Fl B Ar pkg-destdir
.Op Fl D Ar name Ns Op = Ns Ar value
.Ar pkg-name Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to delete packages that have been previously installed
with the
.Xr pkg_add 1
command.
.Pp
Package names may be specified either as the package name itself, or as a
filename which consists of the package name plus the
.Dq .tgz
suffix, or as a full pathname like
.Pa /var/db/pkg/pkgname ,
so that shell wildcards can be used.
.Pp
Version numbers and flavors
.Po
see
.Xr packages-specs 7
.Pc
can be omitted, unless the resulting specification is ambiguous.
.Pp
.Nm
will
.Xr syslog 3
deletions by default
.Po
but see
.Xr pkg.conf 5
.Pc .
.Pp
.Nm
relies on the file system information being consistent.
In case of a system crash,
.Pa /var/db/pkg
may become corrupted.
Use
.Xr pkg_check 8
to repair things.
.Pp
.Nm
may ask questions in interactive mode, or error out otherwise.
Interactive mode is the default on a tty, see
options
.Fl I/i .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width BB-pkg-destdir
.It Fl a
Delete unused dependencies (packages that are not needed by anything tagged
as installed manually).
Can be used without
.Ar pkgnames .
If used with
.Ar pkgnames ,
it will only delete non manual installs in the list.
.It Fl B Ar pkg-destdir
Set
.Ar pkg-destdir
as the prefix to prepend to any object deleted.
.It Fl c
Delete extra configuration file, mentioned as
.Dl @extra file
in the packing-list.
.It Xo
.Fl D
.Ar name Ns Op = Ns Ar value
.Xc
Force removal of the package.
.Ar name
is a keyword that states what failsafe
should be waived.
Recognized keywords include:
.Bl -tag -width "dependenciesXX"
.It Ar baddepend
force the deletion of packages even if they reference inexistent dependencies.
.It Ar dependencies
also delete the whole set of packages that depends upon the requested packages.
.It Ar nonroot
uninstall even if not running as root.
.It Ar scripts
external scripts may fail.
.El
.It Fl I
Force non-interactive mode.
Default is to be interactive when run from a tty.
.It Fl i
Force interactive mode, even if not run from a tty.
.Nm
may ask questions to the user if faced with difficult decisions.
.It Fl m
Causes
.Nm
to always display the progress meter in cases it would not do so by default.
.It Fl n
Don't actually deinstall a package, just report the steps that
would be taken if it were.
.It Fl q
Delete package quickly, do not bother with checksums before removing normal
files.
For signed packages, do not bother verifying signatures either.
If used twice,
it will not bother with checksums for configuration files either.
.It Fl s
Don't actually deinstall packages, report the disk size changes
that would happen.
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output.
Several
.Fl v
turn on more verbose output.
By default,
.Nm
is almost completely silent, but it reacts to keyboard status requests
.Po
see
.Xr stty 1
.Pc .
.Fl v
turns on basic messages,
.Fl vv
adds relevant system operations,
.Fl vvv
shows most internal computations apart from individual file/directory
additions, and
.Fl vvvvv
shows everything.
.It Fl X
Delete everything, except the list of packages that follow.
.It Fl x
Disable progress meter.
.El
.Sh TECHNICAL DETAILS
.Nm
examines installed package records for the
.Ar pkgname
specified,  checks inter-dependencies between installed packages,
deletes the package contents in an order respecting dependencies
(e.g., packages with dependencies get removed first), and finally
removes the package records.
.Pp
If a package is required by other installed packages not mentioned in
the list of packages to remove,
.Nm
will list those dependent packages and refuse to delete the package.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width PKG_DESTDIR
.It Ev PKG_DBDIR
Where to look for installed packages instead of
.Pa /var/db/pkg .
.It Ev PKG_DESTDIR
Value for
.Ar pkg-destdir ,
if no
.Fl B
option is specified.
