.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_delete
.Nd delete software package distributions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pkg_delete
.Op Fl cIinqsvx
.Op Fl B Ar pkg-destdir
.Oo Fl D Ar name
.Ns Oo Ns = Ns Ar value
.Oc
.Oc
.Ar pkg-name Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to delete packages that have been previously installed
with the
.Xr pkg_add 1
command.
.Pp
Package names may be specified either as the package name itself, or as a
filename which consists of the package name plus the
.Dq .tgz
suffix, or as a full pathname like
.Pa /var/db/pkg/pkgname ,
so that shell wildcards can be used.
.Pp
Version numbers and flavors
.Po
see
.Xr packages-specs 7
.Pc
can be omitted, unless the resulting specification is ambiguous.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width BB-pkg-destdir
.It Fl B Ar pkg-destdir
Set
.Ar pkg-destdir
as the prefix to prepend to any object deleted.
.It Fl c
Delete extra configuration file, mentioned as
.Dl @extra file
in the packing-list.
.It Xo
.Fl D
.Ar name Ns Op = Ns Ar value
.Xc
Force removal of the package.
.Ar name
is a keyword that states what failsafe
should be waived.
Recognized keywords include:
.Bl -tag -width "dependenciesXX"
.It Ar ambiguous
delete all packages matching ambiguous package specifications.
.It Ar baddepend
force the deletion of packages even if they reference inexistent dependencies.
.It Ar dependencies
also delete the whole set of packages that depends upon the requested packages.
.It Ar nonroot
uninstall even if not running as root.
.It Ar scripts
external scripts may fail.
.It Ar uninstalled
proceed even if some package names don't resolve to installed package names.
.It Ar verbosedeps
show detailed dependency information.
.El
.It Fl I
If scripts exist for a given package, do not execute them.
.It Fl i
Switch on interactive mode.
.Nm
may ask questions to the user if faced with difficult decisions.
.It Fl n
Don't actually deinstall a package, just report the steps that
would be taken if it were.
.It Fl q
Delete package quickly, do not bother with checksums before removing normal
files.
For signed packages, do not bother verifying signatures either.
If used twice,
it will not bother with checksums for configuration files either.
.It Fl s
Don't actually deinstall packages, report the disk size changes
that would happen.
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output.
Several
.Fl v
turn on more verbose output.
By default,
.Nm
is almost completely silent, but it reacts to keyboard status requests
.Po
see
.Xr stty 1
.Pc .
.Fl v
turns on basic messages,
.Fl vv
adds relevant system operations,
.Fl vvv
shows most internal computations apart from individual file/directory
additions, and
.Fl vvvvv
shows everything.
.It Fl x
Disable progress meter.
.El
.Sh TECHNICAL DETAILS
.Nm
examines installed package records for the
.Ar pkgname
specified,  checks inter-dependencies between installed packages,
deletes the package contents in an order respecting dependencies
(e.g., packages with dependencies get removed first), and finally
removes the package records.
.Pp
If a package is required by other installed packages not mentioned in
the list of packages to remove,
.Nm
will list those dependent packages and refuse to delete the package.
.Pp
If a
.Cm deinstall
script exists for the package, it is executed before any files are removed.
Such a script can be used to remove messy dynamic files created by the
package on installation or during usage.
The
.Nm deinstall
script is called as:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Cm deinstall
.Ar <pkg-name>
.Ar DEINSTALL
.Ed
.Pp
Passing the keyword
.Ar DEINSTALL
lets you potentially write only one program/script that handles all
aspects of installation and deletion.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width PKG_DESTDIR
.It Ev PKG_DBDIR
Where to look for installed packages instead of
.Pa /var/db/pkg .
.It Ev PKG_DESTDIR
Value for
.Ar pkg-destdir ,
if no
.Fl B
option is specified;
value passed to any
.Cm DEINSTALL
or
.Cm REQUIRE
script invoked from the package.
