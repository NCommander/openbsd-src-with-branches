OpenBSD::IdCache - cache for uid and gid look-ups

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use OpenBSD::IdCache;

    my $ucache = new OpenBSD::UidCache;
    my $uid = $ucache->lookup("espie");

    my $gcache = new OpenBSD::GidCache;
    my $gid = $gcache->lookup("wheel", 0);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<OpenBSD::IdCache> provides two classes: C<OpenBSD::UidCache>, for UIDs,
and C<OpenBSD::GidCache> for GIDs.

C<UidCache::new> creates a UID cache, which can be used to look up user
names by using the C<lookup> method.  Looking up a numeric user name
is a no-op. Non-existing IDs return a default value, which is normally
C<undef> but can be provided as an extra argument to C<lookup>.

C<GidCache::new> provides the same service for GIDs.
