.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to create a file database for binary packages,
which can be searched using the
.Xr locate 1
utility.
.Pp
Entries created for each package will have the package name prepended:
.Li kdelibs-3.3.2p2:/usr/local/bin/meinproc .
.Pp
If the
.Fl p
option is used,
and
.Ev SUBDIRLIST
is not defined,
.Nm
will retrieve all package entries from the ports tree.
.Pp
If the
.Fl p
option is used
together with
.Ev SUBDIRLIST ,
.Nm
will retrieve the package entries listed in
.Ev SUBDIRLIST
from the ports tree.
.Pp
Otherwise,
.Nm
will build database entries for every file object for each
.Ar pkg-name
given on the command line,
or for every package in a
.Ar repository
specified as the
.Fl d
option.
If no package name is given,
.Nm
will build database entries for all currently installed packages.
.Pp
By default (unless standard output is a terminal),
the list of names is fed to
.Pa /usr/libexec/locate.mklocatedb
and the end result should be redirected to a file.
.Pp
In addition,
.Nm
can also list files in the base sets of an
.Ox
distribution, which are not exactly packages in the usual sense.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Prepend file names with pkgpath information and package names.
.It Fl C
Check that files from the source and xenocara sets actually exist.
This prevents badly out-of-synch errors.
.It Fl d Ar repository
Scan directory
.Ar repository
for packages.
.It Fl K
Include keyword in each object full name.
This is more accurate, but defeats
.Xr locate 1
compression.
.It Fl n
Do not pipe output to
.Pa /usr/libexec/locate.mklocatedb
(default if standard output is a terminal).
.It Fl P
Prepend file names with pkgpath information instead of package name.
.It Fl p Ar portsdir
Retrieve packing-lists from the ports tree instead of binary packages.
.It Fl q
Be quiet: do not report every package processed to standard error.
.It Fl r Ar release
Specify the location of a release directory
.Po
see
.Xr release 8
.Pc .
.Nm
will list release tar balls from that directory.
.It Fl s Ar src
Specify the location of
.Ox
source.
.Nm
will list sets found under that source directory.
.It Fl u
Update an existing list.
The list must come from standard input, and contain pkgpath information
for items to be replaced.
This can also be used to supplement an existing database with source and
x11 information.
.It Fl X Ar X11src
Specify the location of X11 source.
.Nm
will list sets found under that X11 source directory.
