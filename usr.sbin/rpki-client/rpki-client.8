.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility queries the RPKI repository system with
a built-in HTTPS client and
.Xr openrsync 1
to fetch all X.509 certificates, manifests, and revocation lists under a given
.Em Trust Anchor .
.Nm
subsequently validates each
.Em Signed Object
by constructing and verifying a certification path for the certificate
associated with the Object (including checking relevant CRLs).
.Nm
produces lists of the
.Em Validated ROA Payloads Pq VRPs ,
.Em BGPsec Router Keys Pq BRKs ,
and
.Em Validated ASPA Payloads Pq VAPs
in various formats.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl A
Exclude the aspa-set in the OpenBGPD specific output file.
.It Fl B
Create output in the files
.Pa bird1v4 ,
.Pa bird1v6 ,
and
.Pa bird
(for bird2)
in the output directory which is suitable for the BIRD internet routing daemon.
.It Fl b Ar sourceaddr
Tell the HTTP and rsync clients to use
.Ar sourceaddr
as the source address for connections, which is useful on machines
with multiple interfaces.
.It Fl c
Create output in the file
.Pa csv
in the output directory as comma-separated values of the
.Em Autonomous System ,
the prefix in slash notation, the maximum prefix length, an abbreviation for
the
.Em Trust Anchor
the entry is derived from, and the moment the VRP will expire derived from
the chain of X.509 certificates and CRLs in seconds since the Epoch, UTC.
.It Fl d Ar cachedir
The directory where
.Nm
will store the cached repository data.
Defaults to
.Pa /var/cache/rpki-client .
.It Fl e Ar rsync_prog
Use
.Ar rsync_prog
instead of
.Xr openrsync 1
to fetch repositories.
It must accept the
.Fl rt
and
.Fl -address
flags and connect with rsync-protocol locations.
.It Fl f Ar
Decode the
.Em TAL
or validate the
.Em Signed Object
in
.Ar file
against the RPKI cache stored in
.Ar cachedir
and print human-readable information about the object.
If
.Ar file
is an rsync:// URI, the corresponding file from the cache will be used.
This option implies
.Fl n ,
and can be combined with
.Fl j
to emit a stream of
.Em Concatenated JSON .
.It Fl H Ar fqdn
Create a shortlist and add
.Ar fqdn
to the shortlist.
.Nm
only connects to shortlisted hosts.
The shortlist filter is enforced during processing of the
.Em Subject Information Access Pq SIA
extension in CA certificates, thus applies to both RSYNC and RRDP connections.
This option can be used multiple times.
.It Fl j
Create output in the file
.Pa json
in the output directory as JSON object.
See
.Fl c
for a description of the fields.
.It Fl m
Create output in the file
.Pa metrics
in the output directory in OpenMetrics format.
.It Fl n
Offline mode.
Validate the contents of
.Ar cachedir
and write to
.Ar outputdir
without synchronizing via RRDP or RSYNC.
.It Fl o
Create output in the file
.Pa openbgpd
in the output directory as
.Xr bgpd 8
compatible input.
If the
.Fl B ,
.Fl c ,
and
.Fl j
options are not specified this is the default.
.It Fl R
Synchronize via RSYNC only.
.It Fl r
Synchronize via RRDP.
If RRDP fails, RSYNC will be used.
This is the default.
Mutually exclusive with
.Fl n .
.It Fl S Ar skiplist
Do not connect to hosts listed in the
.Ar skiplist
file.
Entries in the
.Ar skiplist
are newline separated
.Em Fully Qualified Domain Names Pq FQDNs .
A
.Ql #
indicates the beginning of a comment; characters up to the end of the line are
not interpreted.
The skip filter is enforced during processing of the
.Em Subject Information Access Pq SIA
extension in CA certificates, thus applies to both RSYNC and RRDP connections.
By default load entries from
.Pa /etc/rpki/skiplist .
.It Fl s Ar timeout
Terminate after
.Ar timeout
seconds of runtime, because normal practice will restart from
.Xr cron 8 .
Disable by specifying 0.
Defaults to 1 hour.
Individual RSYNC/RRDP repositories are timed out after one fourth of
.Em timeout .
All network synchronisation tasks are aborted after seven eights of
.Em timeout .
.It Fl T Ar table
For BIRD output generated with the
.Fl B
option use
.Ar table
as roa table name instead of the default 'ROAS'.
.It Fl t Ar tal
Specify a
.Em Trust Anchor Location Pq TAL
file to be used.
This option can be used multiple times to load multiple TALs.
By default
.Nm
will load all TAL files in
.Pa /etc/rpki .
TAL are small files containing a public key and URL endpoint address.
.It Fl V
Show the version and exit.
.It Fl v
Increase verbosity.
Specify once for synchronisation status, twice to print the name of each file
as it's processed.
If
.Fl f
is given, specify once to print more information about the encapsulated X.509
certificate, twice to print the certificate in PEM format.
.It Ar outputdir
The directory where
.Nm
will write the output files.
Defaults to
.Pa /var/db/rpki-client/ .
.El
.Pp
By default
.Nm
outputs validated payloads in
.Fl o
(OpenBGPD compatible) format.
.Pp
.Nm
should be run hourly by
.Xr cron 8 :
use
.Xr crontab 1
to uncomment the entry in root's crontab.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
utilizes the following environment variables:
.Bl -tag -width "http_proxy"
.It Ev http_proxy
URL of HTTP proxy to use.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/var/db/rpki-client/openbgpd" -compact
.It Pa /etc/rpki/*.tal
default TAL files used unless
.Fl t Ar tal
is specified.
.It Pa /etc/rpki/skiplist
default skiplist file, unless
.Fl S Ar skiplist
is specified.
.It Pa /var/cache/rpki-client
cached repository data.
.It Pa /var/db/rpki-client/openbgpd
default roa-set output file.
.El
.Pp
All the top-level TAL are included, except the ARIN TAL which is not
made available with terms compatible with open source.
That public key is treated as a propriety object in a lengthy legal
agreement regarding ARIN service restrictions.
