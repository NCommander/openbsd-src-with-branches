.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
.Nm
can be compiled in two ways.  The first is used to send one-off
packets to a destination host, using command line options to specify various
attributes present in the headers.  The destination must be given at the
last command line option, except for when TCP flags are specified as
a combination of A, S, F, U, P and R, last.
.Pp
The other way it may be compiled, with DOSOCKET defined, is to allow an
attempt at making a TCP connection using a with ipsend resending the SYN
packet as per the command line options.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Enable debugging mode.
.It Fl f Ar offset
Allows the IP offset field in the IP header to be set to an arbitrary 
value, which can be specified in decimal or hexadecimal.
.It Fl g Ar gateway
Specify the hostname of the gateway through which to route packets.  This
is required whenever the destination host isn't directly attached to the
same network as the host from which you're sending.
.It Fl i Ar interface
Set the interface name to be the name supplied.
.It Fl m Ar MTU
Specify the MTU to be used when sending out packets.  This option allows you
to set a fake MTU, allowing the simulation of network interfaces with small
MTU's without setting them so.
.It Fl o Ar option
Specify options to be included at the end of the IP header.  An EOL option
is automatically appended and need not be given.  If an option would also
have data associated with it (source as an IP number for a lsrr option), then
this will not be initialised.
.It Fl s Ar source
Set the source address in the packet to that provided - maybe either a
hostname or IP number.
.It Fl t Ar dest.port
Set the destination port for TCP/UDP packets.
.It Fl w Ar window
Set the window size for TCP packets.
.It Fl I
Set the protocol to ICMP.
.It Fl P
Set the protocol to the value given.  If the parameter is a name, the name
is looked up in the 
.Pa /etc/protocols
file.
.It Fl T
Set the protocol to TCP.
.It Fl U
Set the protocol to UDP.
.It Fl v
Enable verbose mode.
