/* mopa.out - Convert a Unix format kernel into something that
 * can be transfered via MOP.
 *
 * This code was written while refering to the NetBSD/vax boot
 * loader. Therefore anything that can be booted by the Vax
 * should be convertable with this program.
 *
 * If necessary, the a.out header is stripped, and the program
 * segments are padded out. The BSS segment is zero filled.
 * A header is prepended that looks like an IHD header. In 
 * particular the Unix mahine ID is placed where mopd expects
 * the image type to be (offset is IHD_W_ALIAS). If the machine
 * ID could be mistaken for a DEC image type, then the conversion 
 * is aborted. The original a.out header is copied into the front
 * of the header so that once we have detected the Unix machine
 * ID we can haul the load address and the xfer address out.
