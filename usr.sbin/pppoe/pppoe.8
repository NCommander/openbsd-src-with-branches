.Sh NAME
.Nm pppoe
.Nd PPP Over Ethernet translator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pppoe
.Op Ar -s
.Op Ar -v
.Op Ar -i interface
.Op Ar -n service
.Op Ar -p system
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm pppoe
program can, with the help of
.Xr ppp 8 ,
act as a server or client for running PPP Over Ethernet.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i Ar interface
Specify the interface that
.Nm
is to use.  If this option is not specified,
.Nm
will use the first Ethernet interface that is up and running.
.It Fl n Ar service
Use
.Ar service
as the service name when negotiating with the server.  By default,
the client will ask for any service, and expect the server to
respond with the same.
.It Fl p Ar system
This argument is passed, uninterpreted, to
.Xr ppp 8 .
It can be used to specify the configuration data to be used for
PPP Over Ethernet connections.
.It Fl s
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run as a server.  Otherwise,
.Nm
runs as a client.
.It Fl v
For each use of the flag, the verbosity of
.Nm pppoe
increases.
.El
.Sh CLIENT SETUP
Configuring the client involves setting up the
configuration file for
.Xr ppp 8 .
The following statements must be included in the file for
the specified
.Ar system
(or
``default''
if no
.Ar system
is specified):
.Bl -tag -width XXX -offset XXX
.It set mtu 1492
.It set mru 1492
.It set speed sync
.It disable acfcomp
.It deny acfcomp
.It disable protocomp
.It set device !/usr/sbin/pppoe
.El
.Pp
Additionally, the authentication mechanism for the connection
must be specified as well as any other parameters.

.Sh HISTORY
This implementation of
.Nm pppoe
first appeared in
.Ox 2.8 .
.Sh AUTHOR
The
.Nm pppoe
program was written by
.An Jason L. Wright
.Aq jason@thought.net
of
.An Network Security Technologies, Inc.
.Aq http://www.netsec.net .
.Sh BUGS
This is software runs completely in user mode.  As such it will have much
more overhead than a kernel implementation.
.Pp
The
.Ar service
is not currently used by the server code.
