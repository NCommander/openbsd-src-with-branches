.Sh NAME
.Nm sasyncd
.Nd IPSec SA synchronization daemon for failover gateways
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dv
.Op Fl c Ar config-file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon synchronizes IPSec SA information between a number of failover
IPsec gateways.
The most typical scenario is to run
.Nm
on hosts also running
.Xr isakmpd 8
and sharing a common IP-address using
.Xr carp 4 .
.Pp
The daemon runs either in master or slave mode, in which the master
tracks all local IPsec SA changes and sends this information along to
all slaves so they will have the same data.
.Ss Failover
.Nm
does not itself do any failover processing; the normal mode of
operation is to track state changes on a specified
.Xr carp 4
interface.
Whenever it changes,
.Nm
will follow suit.
It is possible to
.Qq lock
the daemon to a particular state; see
.Xr sasyncd.conf 5 .
.Ss Host to host communication
All
.Nm
host to host communication is protected by
.Xr ssl 8 ,
so the daemon requires certificates configured for each host.
Normally
.Pa /etc/ssl/sasyncd.crt
and
.Pa /etc/ssl/private/sasyncd.key
are used, although alternate locations may be specified in the
configuration file.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar config-file
If given, the
.Fl c
option specifies an alternate configuration file instead of
.Pa /etc/sasyncd.conf .
.It Fl d
The
.Fl d
option causes the daemon to run in the foreground, logging to stderr.
.It Fl v
The
.Fl v
option increases the verbosity level of the daemon.
This option can be specified several times.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/ssl/private/sasyncd.key -compact
.It Pa /etc/sasyncd.conf
The default
.Nm
configuration file.
.It Pa /etc/ssl/sasyncd.crt
The default certificate.
.It Pa /etc/ssl/private/sasyncd.key
The default private key.
.It Pa /etc/ssl/ca.crt
The default CA certificate.
