.Sh NAME
.Nm sasyncd
.Nd IPSec SA synchronization daemon for failover gateways
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dv
.Op Fl c Ar config-file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon synchronizes IPSec SA information between a number of failover
IPsec gateways.
The most typical scenario is to run
.Nm
on hosts also running
.Xr isakmpd 8
and sharing a common IP-address using
.Xr carp 4 .
.Pp
The daemon runs either in master or slave mode, in which the master
tracks all local IPsec SA changes and sends this information along to
all slaves so they will have the same data.
.Ss Failover
.Nm
does not itself do any failover processing; the normal mode of
operation is to track state changes on a specified
.Xr carp 4
interface.
Whenever it changes,
.Nm
will follow suit.
It is possible to
.Qq lock
the daemon to a particular state; see
.Xr sasyncd.conf 5 .
.Ss Host to host communication
As
.Nm
will transmit IPSec SA keys over a network not guaranteed to be
private,
.Nm
messages are protected using AES and SHA.
The shared key used for the encryption must be specified in
.Pa /etc/sasyncd.conf .
See
.Xr sasyncd.conf 5
for more information.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar config-file
If given, the
.Fl c
option specifies an alternate configuration file instead of
.Pa /etc/sasyncd.conf .
.It Fl d
The
.Fl d
option causes the daemon to run in the foreground, logging to stderr.
Without this option,
.Nm
sends log messages to
.Xr syslog 3 .
.It Fl v
The
.Fl v
option increases the verbosity level of the daemon, used primarily for
debugging.
This option may be specified several times.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/ssl/private/sasyncd.key -compact
.It Pa /etc/sasyncd.conf
The default
.Nm
configuration file.

The

daemon first appeared in
