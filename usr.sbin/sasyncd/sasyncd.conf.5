.Sh NAME
.Nm sasyncd.conf
.Nd configuration file for sasyncd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file for the
.Xr sasyncd 8
daemon.
.Pp
Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark
.Pq Sq # ,
and extends to the end of the current line.
.Pp
Since the file contains the shared secret key used to encrypt data
between this host and the others,
.Pa /etc/sasyncd.conf
must be owned either by
.Dq root
or the
.Dq _isakmpd
pseudo user and be readable only by this owner, e.g.\&
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# chown root /etc/sasyncd.conf
# chmod 0600 /etc/sasyncd.conf
.Ed
.Pp
The following configuration settings are understood:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Ic carp interface
.Ar interface Op Ic interval Ar seconds
.Xc
Specify which
.Xr carp 4
interface
.Nm sasyncd
should track master/slave state on.
Optionally state how often the daemon should check the interface
for state changes.
Defaults to once every 10 seconds.
.It Xo
.Ic listen on Ar address 
.Op Ar family
.Op Ic port Ar port
.Xc
Specify a local IP address, hostname, or interface the
.Xr sasyncd 8
daemon should listen on.
The default is to listen on all local addresses. 
When using an interface name, 
.Ar family
may be given as
.Dq inet
or
.Dq inet6
to only bind using the specified address family. 
Finally, 
.Ar port
can be used to specify which TCP port
.Xr sasyncd 8
should listen to.
The default is to listen to port 500.
.It Ic mode master | slave
Force the daemon to run as master or slave.
Normally only intended for debugging use.
.It Ic peer Ar address
Specify a
.Xr sasyncd 8
peer IP address or hostname.
May be specified multiple times.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
peer 10.0.0.2
peer 10.0.0.3
peer 10.0.0.4
.Ed
.It Ic sharedkey Ar key
The shared AES key used to encrypt messages between
.Xr sasyncd 8
hosts.
This configuration setting is required and must be either 16, 24 or 32
bytes long (corresponding to AES using a 128, 192 or 256 bit key).
