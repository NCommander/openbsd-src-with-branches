.TH set_scanner 1 "25 October 1994"
.SH NAME
set_scanner - change the parameter settings for the scanner
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B set_scanner
.RI [ -w width ]
.RI [ -h height] 
.RI [ -x x_origin ]
.RI [ -y y_origin ]
.RI [ -r resolution ]
.RI [ -l logical_name ]
.RI [ -i image_mode ]
.RI [ \-b brightness ]
.RI [ -c contrast ]
.RI [ -d ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Changes one or more of the scanner's attributes.  Changes are stored
in the ODM if you use the -d flag (for setting default values), but
leaving off the -d is faster.
.SH FLAGS
.B \-w
.I width.
Sets the width of the scanner active area to the given value in inches.
Decimal fractions of inches are acceptable for this and all other size
values.
.PP
.B \-h
.I height.
Sets the height of the scanner active area to the given value in inches.
.PP
.B \-x
.I x_origin.
Sets the upper left hand corner x coordinate of the scanner active area to
the given value in inches.
.PP
.B \-y
.I y_origin.
Sets the upper left hand corner y coordinate of the scanner active area to
the given value in inches.
.PP
.B \-r
.I resolution.
Sets the resolution to the given value in dots-per-inch.  To see
acceptable values for
.I resolution
use "lsattr -R -l scan0 -a x_resolution"
.PP
.B \-l
.I logical name of scanner.
Specifies what scanner to use.  The default is "scan0"
.PP
.B \-i
.I image mode.
Change the type of image data sent by the scanner.  The flag is followed
by a one-letter code representing the image mode.  Use "m" for binary
monochrome (solid black or white), "d" for dithered monochrome (halftoned),
"g" for grayscale, "c" for color, "R" for red only, "G" for green only or
"B" for blue only.  Not all scanners support all formats.
.PP
.B \-b
.I brightness
Set the hardware brightness control inside the scanner, if any.  This flag
is followed by a decimal integer that specifies how bright the image is to be.
To see acceptable values for
.I brightness
use the command "lsattr -R -l scan0 -a brightness".
.PP
.B \-c
.I contrast
Set the hardware contrast control inside the scanner, if any.  This flag
is followed by a decimal integer that specifies the level of contrast used.
To see acceptable values for
.I contrast
use the command "lsattr -R -l scan0 -a contrast".
.I 
.PP
.B \-d
Set the defaults.  Scanner settings will be remembered even after the system
reboots. 
.B set_scanner
will use "chdev" to alter the ODM instead of the ioctl(2) system call on the
device special file.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
the command:
.PP
set_scanner -w 5.5 -h 3.75 -r 300
.PP
will set the active area of the scanner to 5 1/2" x 3 3/4" at 300 dots-per-inch
resolution
.SH "SEE ALSO"
get_scanner(1)
.SH BUGS
Probably should support Metric measurement units too.
