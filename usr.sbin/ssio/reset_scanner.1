.SH NAME
reset-scanner - clear error conditions on the scanner
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B reset-scanner
.RI [ -l <logical-name-of-scanner-to-use>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
If the scanner gets stuck and the error lights go on and you wish that
you could push the reset button on it but there isn't one, run this (as
the super-user) instead and it will send a Bus Device Reset (BDR) to the
scanner.
