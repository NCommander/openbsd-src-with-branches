.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_version
.Nd summarize installed versions of packages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl cdhv
.Op Fl l Ar limchar
.Op Fl L Ar limchar
.Op Ar index
.Nm
.Op Fl t Ar version1 version2
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to produce a report of non-base software packages
installed using the 
.Xr pkg_add 1
command.  
.Pp
Each package's version number is checked against one of two sources to
see if that package may require updating.  If the package contains
information about its origin in the
.Fx
ports tree, and a version number can be determined from the port's
.Pa Makefile ,
then the version number from the 
.Pa Makefile
will be used to determine whether the installed package is up-to-date
or requires updating.
.Pp
If no origin for a package can be found, or if the port's 
.Pa Makefile
cannot be located, 
.Nm
will search for the package in the ports collection index file
(typically
.Pa /usr/ports/INDEX ) .
Any matching version number(s) there will be used to determine whether
the installed package is up-to-date or requires updating.
.Pp
Generally, using the version number from a port's 
.Pa Makefile
will provide a more accurate result, since, unlike the index file, it 
provides an unambiguous current version number, even when multiple
versions of a port exist in the ports collection.
Moreover, the ports collection index file is only updated at
intervals, meaning that it may not completely reflect the version
numbers of the software contained in the ports collection.
.Pp
Each package name is printed, along with a one-character status flag:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Li =
The installed version of the package is current.
.It Li \&<
The installed version of the package is older than the current version.
.It Li \&>
The installed version of the package is newer than the current version.
This situation can arise with an out-of-date index file, or when
testing new ports.
.It Li \&?
The installed package does not appear in the index. 
This could be due to an out of date index or a package taken from a PR 
that has not yet been committed.
.It Li *
There are multiple versions of a particular software package
listed in the index file.
Examples from the
.Fx
ports collection are the Tcl toolkit or the
.Tn EMACS
editor.
.It Li \&!
The installed package exists in the index but for some reason,
.Nm
was unable to compare the version number of the installed package
with the corresponding entry in the index.
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
.Nm 
supports several command-line arguments:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c
Enable commands output.  Commands output includes the commands you should
type to update your installed packages to the latest versions in the ports
system.
This feature does
.Bf Em
not
.Ef
constitute an automated packages updating system.
The output of this command 
.Bf Em
must
.Ef
be edited, in order to avoid destroying dependencies between installed
packages.
.It Fl d
Enable debugging output.
.It Fl h
Print help message.
.It Fl l
Limit the output to those packages whose status flag matches the 
character(s) in
.Ar limchar .
More than one character can be specified in
.Ar limchar .  
Note that because some of the status flag characters are also special
to the shell, it is best to quote
.Ar limchar
with single quotes.
.It Fl L
Limit the output to those packages whose status flag doesn't match
.Ar limchar .
You may specify more than one character to match in
.Ar limchar .  
Note that because some of the status flag characters are also special
to the shell, it is best to quote
.Ar limchar
with single quotes.
.It Fl t
Test a pair of version number strings and exit.
The output consists of one of the single characters
.Li =
(equal),
.Li \&<
(right-hand number greater), or
.Li \&>
(left-hand number greater) on standard output.
This flag is mostly useful for scripts or for testing.
.It Fl v
Enable verbose output.  Verbose output includes some English-text
interpretations of the version number comparisons, as well as the
version numbers compared for each package.  Non-verbose output is
probably easier for programs or scripts to parse.
.It Ar index
Specify the index to be used as a basis of comparison.  This index can
be specified as a filename (in the local filesystem) or a URL.  Any
URL understandable by
.Xr fetch 1
can be used here.  If no
.Ar index
file is specified on the command line,
.Pa /usr/ports/INDEX
is used.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fetch 1 ,
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
.Xr pkg_create 1 ,
.Xr pkg_delete 1 ,
.Xr pkg_info 1
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/ports/INDEX -compact
.It Pa /usr/ports/INDEX
Default index file.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following is a typical invocation of the
.Nm
command, which checks the installed packages against the local ports
index file:
.Pp
.Dl % pkg_version -v
.Pp
The command below generates a report against
the version numbers in the on-line ports collection:
.Pp
.Dl % pkg_version ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/branches/-current/ports/INDEX
.Pp
The command below generates a file of commands to run to update the installed
files.
These commands must
.Bf Em
not
.Ef
be run without suitable editing.
They should be treated as suggestions, and may need to be reordered 
to account for dependencies between installed packages, or may need to
be disregarded if multiple versions of an installed package can coexist.
Blindly running the output of this command may leave a system in an
unusable state.
.Pp
.Dl % pkg_version -c > do_update
.Pp
The following command compares two package version strings:
.Pp
.Dl % pkg_version -t 1.5 1.5.1

.Sh BUGS
.Pp
The commands output feature is 
.Bf Em 
not
.Ef
an automated ports/packages updating system.
It does not even attempt to handle dependencies between installed 
packages correctly, and can produce incorrect results if multiple
versions of a package can coexist on a system.
.Pp
Commands output assumes you install new software using the ports system,
rather than using
.Xr pkg_add 1 .
