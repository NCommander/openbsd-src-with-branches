To sign packages in a transparent way:
gzip files can handle an EXTRA_FIELD at the beginning that
stores anything we wish.

So it's just a question to choose a format for the signature, and to
embed it there.

We put a specific cookie `S, i, g, P, G, P, length'
at the beginning of the extra-field, so that eventually we can put
more information in that field (like several signatures),
followed by the signature output by PGP.

The checker just needs to extract the signature, pass it off to PGP,
followed by the uncompressed archive.

* Signed archives that just look like normal .tar.gz files,
* Possibility to grab the files off the net and extract stuff/verify
signatures on the fly (just need to wedge the checker as an intermediate
pipe)
* Pretty simple, small portable code to be able to check signatures
everywhere (the signer itself needs getpass and corresponding functionality)
