This is a small utility which is used to convert the hex output of Paul
Mackerras' gspa to an initialized array of unsigned shorts.

Input format:

:hex -> start address
@hex -> new load address
hex -> load @load address & autoincrement 

Output format:

Load blocks start with 16 bit count of the data without address, then
high 16 bits of load address, then low 16 bits of load address, followed by
count words of data. This sequence is repeated until count == 0.

The start address is converted to two load blocks which set the
NMI and the RESET vector.
