.Sh NAME
.Nm sysmerge
.Nd update system configuration files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl s Ar src \*(Ba etcXX.tgz
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a
.Xr sh 1
script designed to help the administrator update configuration files
after upgrading to a new release or snapshot.
The configuration files are typically those held in
.Pa /etc ,
though
.Nm
is also able to update files held in
.Pa /dev ,
.Pa /root ,
and
.Pa /var .
.Pp
It is
.Sy HIGHLY
recommended to back up the
.Pa /etc
directory before running this script.
.Pp
.Nm
works by comparing a temporary reference root directory
against locally installed files.
All work is done under
.Pa ${TMPDIR}/sysmerge.XXXXX
(known as the
.Em work directory ) .
The temporary root directory
.Pa temproot
is created under the work directory.
Each modified and/or replaced file is saved under the
.Pa backup
directory inside the work directory.
.Pp
When run in
.Em automatic
mode
.Pq Fl a ,
.Nm
will skip files with identical CVS Id, install missing ones and run commands
associated with the following special files if they were modified:
.Xr aliases 5 ,
.Xr login.conf 5 ,
.Xr MAKEDEV 8 ,
.Xr passwd 5 .
In
.Em manual
mode (the default unless
.Fl a
is specified),
.Nm
will perform a strict comparison of files.
.Pp
.Nm
will work through the fileset,
offering the chance to merge any differences using
.Xr sdiff 1 .
Files may also be left to deal with at a later date.
Should any problems occur,
such as a failure to upgrade a file,
the user will be notified and have to deal with the issue by hand.
.Pp
The following files will always be skipped from comparison:
.Pa /etc/*.db ,
.Pa /etc/mail/*.db ,
.Pa /etc/passwd ,
.Pa /etc/motd ,
.Pa /etc/myname ,
.Pa /var/mail/root .
.Pp
The
.Xr sendmail 8
configuration files
.Pa /etc/mail/localhost.cf ,
.Pa /etc/mail/sendmail.cf
and
.Pa /etc/mail/submit.cf
will always differ because they include their build date.
A special test was added to handle this
and they are offered for comparison only if they really differ.
.Pp
.Nm
will finish by running
.Xr mtree 8
to make sure the directory structure has correct permissions.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Automatic mode.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will automatically install missing files,
create databases and device nodes,
and will disable strict file comparison when possible (using CVS Ids).
.It Fl s Ar src \*(Ba etcXX.tgz
Specify a path to an
.Ox
top src directory or an etcXX.tgz tarball.
The default is
.Pa /usr/src .
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "DESTDIRXXX"
.It Ev DESTDIR
Directory in which to merge and install files.
If unset, this defaults to
.Pa / .
.It Ev TMPDIR
Directory in which the work directory is created.
If unset, this defaults to
.Pa /var/tmp .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "${TMPDIR}/sysmerge.XXXXXXXX" -compact
.It ${TMPDIR}/sysmerge.XXXXX
Default work directory.
The
.Sy temproot
and
.Sy backup
directories are created relative to this.
