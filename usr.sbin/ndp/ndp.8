.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command manipulates the address mapping table
used by the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP).
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Dump the currently existing NDP entries.
The following information will be printed:
.Bl -tag -width NeighborXX
.It Neighbor
IPv6 address of the neighbor.
.It Linklayer Address
Linklayer address of the neighbor.
It could be
.Dq Li (incomplete)
when the address is not available.
.It Netif
Network interface associated with the neighbor cache entry.
.It Expire
The time until expiry of the entry.
The entry could become
.Dq Li permanent ,
in which case it will never expire.
.It S
State of the neighbor cache entry, as a single letter:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It N
Nostate
.It W
Waitdelete
.It I
Incomplete
.It R
Reachable
.It S
Stale
.It D
Delay
.It P
Probe
.It ?
Unknown state (should never happen).
.El
.It Flags
Flags on the neighbor cache entry, in a single letter.
They are: Router, proxy neighbor advertisement
.Pq Dq p .
The field could be followed by a decimal number,
which means the number of NS probes the node has sent during the current state.
.El
.It Fl A Ar wait
Repeat
.Fl a
.Pq dump NDP entries
every
.Ar wait
seconds.
.It Fl c
Erase all the NDP entries.
.It Fl d
Delete specified NDP entry.
.It Fl f
Parse the file specified by
.Ar filename .
.It Fl H
Harmonize consistency between the routing table and the default router
list; install the top entry of the list into the kernel routing table.
.It Fl I Ar interface
Shows or specifies the default interface used as the default route when
there is no default router.
If a valid
.Ar interface
is specified, the interface will be used as the default.
If
.Ar interface
is not a valid interface name, the current setting will be presented.
.It Fl I Li delete
The current default interface will be deleted from the kernel.
.It Fl i Ar interface Op Ar flags ...
View ND information for the specified interface.
If additional arguments
.Ar flags
are given,
.Nm
sets or clears the specified flags for the interface.
Each flag should be separated by white spaces or tab characters.
Possible flags are as follows.
All of the flags can begin with the
special character
.Ql - ,
which means the flag should be cleared.
.\"
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic nud
.Xc
Turn on or off NUD (Neighbor Unreachability Detection) on the
interface.
NUD is usually turned on by default.
.It Xo
.Ic accept_rtadv
.Xc
Specify whether or not to accept Router Advertisement messages
received on the
.Ar interface .
Note that the kernel does not accept Router Advertisement messages
unless the
.Li net.inet6.ip6.accept_rtadv
variable is non-0, even if the flag is on.
This flag is set to 1 by default.
.It Xo
.Ic prefer_source
.Xc
Prefer addresses on the
.Ar interface
as candidates of the source address for outgoing packets.
The default value of this flag is off.
For more details about the entire algorithm of source address
selection, see the
.Pa IMPLEMENTATION
file supplied with the KAME kit.
.El
.It Fl n
Do not try to resolve numeric addresses to hostnames.
.It Fl p
Show prefix list.
.It Fl P
Flush all the entries in the prefix list.
.It Fl r
Show default router list.
.It Fl R
Flush all the entries in the default router list.
.It Fl s
Register a NDP entry for a node.
The entry will be permanent unless the word
.Ic temp
is given in the command.
If the word
.Ic proxy
is given, this system will act as an proxy NDP server,
responding to requests for
.Ar hostname
even though the host address is not its own.
.It Fl t
Print timestamp on each entry,
making it possible to merge output with
.Xr tcpdump 8 .
Most useful when used with
.Fl A .

.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
