# small list of commands to build all on a linux system
# libtoolize is needed for most other targets

# on Solaris, and other systems that may not have
# the default 'automake' and 'aclocal' script aliases,
# the correct versions may need to be set. On those
# systems, the 'autoreconf' line should be changed to:
# AUTOMAKE=automake-1.10 ACLOCAL=aclocal-1.10 autoreconf
# (and these systems probably need gmake instead of make)

# older versions of libtoolize do not support --install
# so you might need to remove that (with newer versions
# it is needed)
libtoolize -c --install
autoreconf --install
./configure
make
make doc  # needs doxygen for the html pages
(cd examples && autoreconf && ./configure && make)
(cd drill && autoreconf && ./configure && make)
(cd pcat && autoreconf && ./configure && make)
(cd examples/nsd-test && autoreconf && ./configure && make)
