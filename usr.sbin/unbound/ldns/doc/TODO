Features:
* Multi-line zone file parsing
* Configure option for not printing DNSSEC RR comments
* HMAC and MD5 without OpenSSL
* HIP RR support
* Parse 'search' attribute in /etc/resolv.conf
* Make use of automake (Bug #173)
* ./configure --with-tools --with-drill (Bug #264)
* Drill: print appropriate DS RRs (relates to Bug #355)
* ldns-signzone optout to be really optout
* Compression when generating wireformat. Preferably with a configurable 
  policy: refer only backwards, case sensitivity, only refer to other owner 
  names, etc.

Bugfixes:
* Bug #279: fix return values for net.h functions, and related: make return
  values for functions that cannot return memory-failure today. Needs medium
  version increase because of API change.
* Long out-standing packaging bugs (debian)
* Lazy ABI
