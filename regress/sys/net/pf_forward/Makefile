# This test needs a manual setup of four machines
# The setup is the same as for regress/sys/net/pf_fragment
# Set up machines: SRC PF RT ECO
# SRC is the machine where this makefile is running.
# PF is running OpenBSD forwarding through pf, it is the test target.
# RT is a router forwarding packets, maximum MTU is 1300.
# ECO is reflecting the ping and UDP and TCP echo packets.
# RDR does not exist, PF redirects the traffic to ECO.
# AF does not exist, PF translates address family and sends to ECO.

# Configure Addresses on the machines, there must be routes for the

# setup.  To control the remote machine you need a hostname for
# ssh to log in.
# You must have an anchor "regress" for the divert rules in the pf.conf
# of the PF machine.  The kernel of the PF machine gets testet.

# Run make check-setup to see if you got the setup correct.
