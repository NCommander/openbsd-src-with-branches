.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm autest
.Nd test audio encoding output
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm autest
.Op Fl f Ar device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility opens the
.Xr audio 4
device specified with the
.Fl f
flag
or
.Pa /dev/sound
if not specified,
and iterates through all of the encodings supported by the device playing
a 440Hz tone in the proper format.
The tone should sound almost identical in each of the formats.
.Pp
.Nm
can produce tones in any of the following formats and will skip other
formats if supported by the device:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXX
.It Cm mulaw
8bit U-Law companded
.It Cm alaw
8bit A-Law companded
.It Cm adpcm
4 bit adaptive differential pulse code modulation
.It Cm ulinear
8 bit unsigned linear.
.It Cm ulinear_le
16 bit unsigned linear little endian
.It Cm ulinear_be
16 bit unsigned linear big endian
.It Cm slinear
8 bit signed linear (twos complement)
.It Cm slinear_le
16 bit signed linear little endian (twos complement)
.It Cm slinear_be
16 bit signed linear big endian (twos complement)
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr audio 4
.Sh BUGS
The ADPCM encoding sounds very noisy on CS4231 (it's probably incorrect).
