Stress test bind(2) and connect(2) system calls in OpenBSD regress.

bindconnect [-b bind] [-c connect] [-n num] [-o close] [-s socket] [-t time]
    -b bind     threads binding sockets, default 1
    -c connect  threads connecting sockets, default 1
    -n num      number of file descriptors, default 100
    -o close    threads closing sockets, default 1
    -s socket   threads creating sockets, default 1
    -t time     run time in seconds, default 10

Separate threads are started to run socket(2), close(2), bind(2),
and connect(2) system calls concurrently.  The number of sockets
is controlled by the process limit of open file descriptors.  All
system calls operate on random file descriptors.  By setting the
number of threads for each system call and the number of available
file descriptors, the focus for the stress test can be changed.

Currently only IPv4 UDP sockets with 127.0.0.1 are supported.
