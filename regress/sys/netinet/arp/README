Regression tests for the ARP implementation in the kernel.

The test suite runs on the machine LOCAL, the kernel under test is
running on REMOTE.  On LOCAL Scapy is generating ARP packes and
sends them to REMOTE.  The replies to LOCAL are analyzed.  The
kernel log files are fetched from REMOTE via SCP and grepped for
messages.  The ARP table of REMOTE is inspected via SSH login.

Interfaces and adresses on REMOTE and LOCAL must be preconfigured.
The test manually adds entries into the REMOTE ARP table and tries
to overwrite them with fake ARP packets.  Some addresses are on the
REMOTE interface facing LOCAL other are on a second interface.  The
ARP input code has different cases for that.  So all possible log
messages from ARP input can be triggered by a subtest.

Additionally check that REMOTE can answer a Proxy ARP Requests.
