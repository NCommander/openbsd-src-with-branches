# To hunt kernel bugs during exit, terminate processes simultaneously.
# Fork 300 children that sleep.  Kill them together as process group.
# Sleeping can optionally be done with individual memory layout by
# executing sleep(1).  Optionally each child may create threads.
# Test killing 30 processes with 30 threads each.
