# The arg tests take a perl hash with arguments controlling the
# test parameters.  Generally they consist of client, relay, server.
# The relay.pl test fork these three processes locally.  The remote.pl
# test has local client and server but the relay process is running
# on a remote machine reachable with ssh.  All tests can run with
# a regular userland copy relay or with a kernel socket splicing
# relay.
