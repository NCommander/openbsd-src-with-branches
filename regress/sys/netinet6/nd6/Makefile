# Duplicate Address Detection
# - request  NS from unspecified address to target solicitated-node multicast

# Address Resolution
# - request  NS from interface address   to target solicitated-node multicast
# - response NA from interface address   to source of NS
#
# Unsolicited Neighbor Advertisements
# - request  NA from interface address   to all-nodes multicast
#
# Neighbor Unreachability Detection
# - request  NS from interface address   to target unicast
# - response NA from interface address   to source of NS
