# t3: a case where patch should detect a previously applied patch.
#     Diff transform an empty file into a single line one. Currently fails.

#     Diff transform a file with a single line with an eol into a single
#     line without eol.
# t5: both files in diff do not exist. t5.in should be missing.
# t6-t12: various cases of no eol at end of file handling.
# t13: a case where patch has to detect a previously applied patch.
#     Diff transform a file ending with no eol into a file ending with eol.
# t14: diff in normal diff format.
# t15: diff in context diff format.
# t16: diff in ed format.
# t17: diff in ed format that inserts a dot-line.
