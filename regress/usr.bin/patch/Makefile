# t1: diff contains invalid line number 0.
# t2: diff contains invalid line numbers beyond end of input file.
# t3: a case where it patch should detect a previously applied patch.
#     Diff transform an empty file into a single line one. Patch cannot
#     detect this because it has an empty context.
# t4: a case where patch has to detect a previously applied patch.
#     Diff transform an file with a single line without eol into a single
#     line with eol. Fails because patch does not detect the previously
#     applied diff.
