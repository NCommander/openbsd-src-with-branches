.Sh NAME
.Nm mdoclint
.Nd man page verifier
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl aDdeFfHhmnoPprSsvwXx
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a man page verifier.
It tries to automatically find as many common
errors that occur when writing man pages as possible.
If no flags are given,
.Fl aDdfHmnoPprSsXx
is assumed (that is, everything except
.Fl eFhvw ) .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Warn about some possible problems in the
.Sx SEE ALSO
section, like incorrect order (correct order: first by section
numbers, then by name), or incorrect or superfluous punctuation
between or after the cross-references.
.It Fl D
Warn about bad casing and architectures in the .Dt macro.
.It Fl d
Warn about .Dd strings
that don't start
.Dq .Dd $\&Mdocdate .
.It Fl e
Warn about unsorted errors (for functions).
.It Fl F
Fix whitespace problems (see also
.Fl s ) .
.It Fl f
Warn about possible .Fn abuse; its arguments should be put in
.Sq \&"
separately, not together and separated by commas.
Those will be automatically added by mdoc.
.It Fl H
Show warnings for characters that might generate problems in
HTML output:
.Sq \*(Lt
and
.Sq \*(Gt .
Replace a pair of angle quotes with the .Aq macro.
Otherwise, the replacements are
.Dq \e*(Lt
and
.Dq \e*(Gt .
.It Fl h
Display usage.
.It Fl m
Warn if man page is not in
.Xr mdoc 7
format.
.It Fl n
Warn when the .Nd macro's argument ends in a dot, that is
.Sq \&. .
.It Fl o
Warn when the .Os macro has an argument (it shouldn't have one at
least in the base system, because on
.Ox
the current version is default).
.It Fl P
Warn about paragraph problems, like empty lines or .Pp macros before
section macros like .Ss and .Sh.
.It Fl p
Warn about possible punctuation problems at the end of macro arguments,
abuse of .Ns to get punctuation directly next to a word,
and sentences not starting on a new line.
.It Fl r
Warn about missing RCS Id.
.It Fl S
Warn about any unknown sections or about a section that comes in the
wrong order (see
.Xr mdoc 7 ) .
.It Fl s
Warn about superfluous whitespace at the end of line.
.It Fl v
Verbose output.
.It Fl w
Display the section name,
in addition to the relevant line number,
in warnings.
.It Fl X
Warn about explicit mentions of the words
.Dq FreeBSD ,
.Dq NetBSD ,
and
.Dq OpenBSD ,
which should be replaced by .Fx, .Nx, and .Ox respectively.
Also notices occurrences of
.Dq \&.Bx Free ,
.Dq \&.Bx Net ,
and
.Dq \&.Bx Open ,
for which the same applies.
.It Fl x
Warn about cross-references whose target is missing, cross-references
to itself, or plain bogus cross-references.
.Pp
For
.Dq .Xr name X ,
the following files are checked:
.Pa /usr/share/man/catX/name.0 ,
.Pa /usr/share/man/catX/`uname -m`/name.0 ,
.Pa ./name.X ,
.Pa /usr/X11R6/man/catX/name.0 ,
and
.Pa /usr/X11R6/man/manX/name.X .

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Ox 4.5 .

.Sh BUGS
The
.Fl o
and
.Fl p
flags currently produce too many bogus warnings.
.Pp
The
.Fl x
flag sometimes erroneously warns about xrefs to man pages for
machine-dependent drivers that are not for the architecture
.Nm
is running on.
