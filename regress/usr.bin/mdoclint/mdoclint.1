.Sh NAME
.Nm mdoclint
.Nd man page verifier
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl DdeFhlmoprSvwx
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a man page verifier.
It tries to automatically find as many common
errors that occur when writing man pages as possible.
If no flags are given,
.Fl DdmoprSx
is assumed (that is, everything except
.Fl eFhlvw ) .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D
Warn about bad casing and architectures in the .Dt macro.
.It Fl d
Warn about bad date strings (in the .Dd macro).
.It Fl e
Warn about unsorted errors (for functions).
.It Fl F
Delete whitespace at the end of input lines.
.It Fl h
Display usage.
.It Fl l
Warn about unknown libraries used as arguments to Lb.
.It Fl m
Warn if man page is not in
.Xr mdoc 7
format.
.It Fl o
Warn when the .Os macro has an argument (it shouldn't have one at
least in the base system, because on
.Ox
the current version is default).
.It Fl p
Warn about possible punctuation problems at the end of macro arguments
and abuse of .Ns to get punctuation directly next to a word.
.It Fl r
Warn about missing RCS Id.
.It Fl S
Warn about any unknown sections or about a section that comes in the
wrong order (see
.Xr mdoc 7 ) .
.It Fl v
Verbose output.
.It Fl w
Display the section name,
in addition to the relevant line number,
in warnings.
.It Fl x
Warn about cross-references whose target is missing, cross-references
to itself, or plain bogus cross-references.
.Pp
For
.Dq .Xr name X ,
the following files are checked:
.Pa /usr/share/man/manX/name.X ,
.Pa /usr/share/man/manX/`uname -m`/name.X ,
.Pa ./name.X ,
and
.Pa /usr/X11R6/man/manX/name.X .

.Sh BUGS
The
.Fl o
and
.Fl p
flags currently produce too many bogus warnings.
.Pp
The
.Fl x
flag sometimes erroneously warns about xrefs to man pages for
machine-dependent drivers that are not for the architecture
.Nm
is running on.
