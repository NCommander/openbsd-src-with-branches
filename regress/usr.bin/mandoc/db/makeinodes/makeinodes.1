.Sh NAME
.Nm makeinodes
.Nd create files such that inode numbers hash in a defined order
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm makeinodes
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates a directory
.Pa man/man1/
and two empty files
.Pa man/man1/1
and
.Pa man/man1/2
such that the lowest six bits of the inode number of file 1
are smaller than the lowest six bits of the inode number of file 2.
.Pp
This is useful to test the behaviour of the
.Xr makewhatis 8
program which hashes files with
.Xr ohash 3
according to their inode numbers, such that fully testing all the
code paths requires test files hashing in a well-defined order.
.Pp
Once the files have been created with
.Nm ,
their content can be provided with
.Xr cat 1
and they can be renamed as desired with
.Xr mv 1 .
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
It may fail when creation of a directory or file,
lookup of an inode number, or renaming of a file fails.
