.Dt MAKEINODES 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm makeinodes
.Nd create files such that inode numbers hash in a defined order
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm makeinodes
.Op Fl r
.Ar dirname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates a directory
.Ar dirname
with a subdirectory
.Pa man1
and two empty files
.Pa man1/one.1
and
.Pa man1/two.1
such that the lowest six bits of the inode number of file
.Pa one.1
are smaller than the lowest six bits of the inode number of file
.Pa two.1 .
If
.Fl r
is specified, the reverse order is produced.
.Pp
This is useful to test the behaviour of the
.Xr makewhatis 8
program which hashes files with
.Xr ohash_init 3
according to their inode numbers, such that fully testing all the
code paths requires test files hashing in a well-defined order.
.Pp
Once the files have been created with
.Nm ,
their content can be provided with
.Xr cat 1 .
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
It may fail when creation of a directory or file,
lookup of an inode number, or renaming of a file fails.
