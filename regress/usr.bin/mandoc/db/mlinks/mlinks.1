.Sh NAME
.Nm mlinks
.Nd extract desired mlinks from a mandoc.db(5) file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mlinks
.Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads a
.Xr mandoc_db 5
database from the given
.Ar file .
For each manual page name that does not agree with the filename,
it write one line to standard output, containing:
.Pp
.Bl -dash -compact
.It
the filename
.It
a comma
.It
the other name
.It
a period
.It
the section number
.El
.Pp
This format is useful for portable software intended to run on
operating systems that require multiple file system entries
for pages having multiple names.
.Pp
For example, it is used to generate MLINKS for portable LibreSSL.
.Sh FILES
The header files
.Qq Pa dbm_map.h
and
.Qq Pa dbm.h
and the object files
.Pa dbm_map.o
and
.Pa dbm.o
from the
.Xr mandoc 1
build are required to compile and link
.Nm .
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
It fails when no argument or more than one argument is given, when
.Fn dbm_open
fails, or when database corruption is detected.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Ingo Schwarze Aq Mt schwarze@openbsd.org
.Sh CAVEATS
