       ce-break - centering requests broken by high-level macros

       initial text
                        Text centered with the .ce request is
       _n_o_t filled.
                                             Text adjusted to the right margin
                                             works in just the same way and is
       _n_o_t filled either.
                     High-level macros break centering even in a
       _c_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n_a_l block.

       Now entering
       explicit no-fill mode.
                                    Text is still
       _n_o_t
       filled.

       final text in fill mode
