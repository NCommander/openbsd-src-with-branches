# groff-1.22.3/mandoc differences:
# - When the first Nm does not have an argument but a later one has,
#   mandoc retroactively uses the later name for the earlier instances
#   of Nm, too, while groff does not.
# - When the head of an Nm block in the SYNOPSIS is broken by an
#   explicit block end macro on the same line, formatting differs,
#   but doesn't make sense either way.
# - Groff doesn't support the nS register.
