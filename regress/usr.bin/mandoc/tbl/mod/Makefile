# groff-1.22.3 defects:
# - The "f" font modifier swallows a following newline character.
# - When space is insufficient (on either side) for properly aligning
#   a number, GNU tbl(1) moves the number too much to the right,
#   overflowing the column, even if space would be sufficient without
#   left padding.
