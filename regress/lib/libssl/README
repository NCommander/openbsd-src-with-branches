testenc.sh tests encryption routines
testdsa.sh tests DSA certificate generation
test_server.sh starts a tls1 server using the above generated certificate
test_client.sh starts a client to talk to the server.
testrsa.sh tests RSA certificate generation - this SHOULD FAIL with the
           version of the library in openbsd because all the RSA routines 
	   are (currently) stubbed.
